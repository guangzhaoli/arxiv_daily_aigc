            <p class="paper-summary">Generating high-quality cartoon animations multimodal control is challenging
due to the complexity of non-human characters, stylistically diverse motions
and fine-grained emotions. There is a huge domain gap between real-world videos
and cartoon animation, as cartoon animation is usually abstract and has
exaggerated motion. Meanwhile, public multimodal cartoon data are extremely
scarce due to the difficulty of large-scale automatic annotation processes
compared with real-life scenarios. To bridge this gap, We propose the
MagicAnime dataset, a large-scale, hierarchically annotated, and multimodal
dataset designed to support multiple video generation tasks, along with the
benchmarks it includes. Containing 400k video clips for image-to-video
generation, 50k pairs of video clips and keypoints for whole-body annotation,
12k pairs of video clips for video-to-video face animation, and 2.9k pairs of
video and audio clips for audio-driven face animation. Meanwhile, we also build
a set of multi-modal cartoon animation benchmarks, called MagicAnime-Bench, to
support the comparisons of different methods in the tasks above. Comprehensive
experiments on four tasks, including video-driven face animation, audio-driven
face animation, image-to-video animation, and pose-driven character animation,
validate its effectiveness in supporting high-fidelity, fine-grained, and
controllable generation.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision task due to
its subjective nature and the subtle, holistic features that influence human
perception. Prevailing methods, often based on deep convolutional networks or
standard Vision Transformers pre-trained on generic object classification
(e.g., ImageNet), struggle to learn feature representations that are truly
aligned with high-level aesthetic assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel
two-stage framework that leverages the power of generative models to create a
superior, domain-specific feature extractor. In the first stage, we pre-train a
Diffusion Transformer on a large-scale, unlabeled facial dataset (FFHQ) through
a self-supervised denoising task. This process forces the model to learn the
fundamental data distribution of human faces, capturing nuanced details and
structural priors essential for aesthetic evaluation. In the second stage, the
pre-trained and frozen encoder of our Diffusion Transformer is used as a
backbone feature extractor, with only a lightweight regression head being
fine-tuned on the target FBP dataset (FBP5500). Our method, termed Diff-FBP,
sets a new state-of-the-art on the FBP5500 benchmark, achieving a Pearson
Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.932, significantly outperforming prior art
based on general-purpose pre-training. Extensive ablation studies validate that
our generative pre-training strategy is the key contributor to this performance
leap, creating feature representations that are more semantically potent for
subjective visual tasks.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The virtual content in augmented reality (AR) can introduce misleading or
harmful information, leading to semantic misunderstandings or user errors. In
this work, we focus on visual information manipulation (VIM) attacks in AR
where virtual content changes the meaning of real-world scenes in subtle but
impactful ways. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes these attacks into
three formats: character, phrase, and pattern manipulation, and three purposes:
information replacement, information obfuscation, and extra wrong information.
Based on the taxonomy, we construct a dataset, AR-VIM. It consists of 452
raw-AR video pairs spanning 202 different scenes, each simulating a real-world
AR scenario. To detect such attacks, we propose a multimodal semantic reasoning
framework, VIM-Sense. It combines the language and visual understanding
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) with optical character
recognition (OCR)-based textual analysis. VIM-Sense achieves an attack
detection accuracy of 88.94% on AR-VIM, consistently outperforming vision-only
and text-only baselines. The system reaches an average attack detection latency
of 7.07 seconds in a simulated video processing framework and 7.17 seconds in a
real-world evaluation conducted on a mobile Android AR application.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Non-rigid registration is essential for Augmented Reality guided laparoscopic
liver surgery by fusing preoperative information, such as tumor location and
vascular structures, into the limited intraoperative view, thereby enhancing
surgical navigation. A prerequisite is the accurate prediction of
intraoperative liver deformation which remains highly challenging due to
factors such as large deformation caused by pneumoperitoneum, respiration and
tool interaction as well as noisy intraoperative data, and limited field of
view due to occlusion and constrained camera movement. To address these
challenges, we introduce PIVOTS, a Preoperative to Intraoperative
VOlume-To-Surface registration neural network that directly takes point clouds
as input for deformation prediction. The geometric feature extraction encoder
allows multi-resolution feature extraction, and the decoder, comprising novel
deformation aware cross attention modules, enables pre- and intraoperative
information interaction and accurate multi-level displacement prediction. We
train the neural network on synthetic data simulated from a biomechanical
simulation pipeline and validate its performance on both synthetic and real
datasets. Results demonstrate superior registration performance of our method
compared to baseline methods, exhibiting strong robustness against high amounts
of noise, large deformation, and various levels of intraoperative visibility.
We publish the training and test sets as evaluation benchmarks and call for a
fair comparison of liver registration methods with volume-to-surface data. Code
and datasets are available here https://github.com/pengliu-nct/PIVOTS.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Inserting 3D objects into videos is a longstanding challenge in computer
graphics with applications in augmented reality, virtual try-on, and video
composition. Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains
difficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,
perspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have
shown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with
maintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D
rendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in
achieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object
insertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,
we focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high
temporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and
refining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure
realistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven
pipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,
reflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To
maintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame
weighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and
2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for
realistic and consistent video editing. Project Page:

            <p class="paper-summary">Pansharpening aims to fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images with
low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) images to generate high-resolution
multispectral (HRMS) images. Although deep learning-based methods have achieved
promising performance, they generally suffer from severe performance
degradation when applied to data from unseen sensors. Adapting these models
through full-scale retraining or designing more complex architectures is often
prohibitively expensive and impractical for real-world deployment. To address
this critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for
cross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast
Transfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based
on data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the
bias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\% of
the most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used
to probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior
of its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update
of only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a
plug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening
models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation
time from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.
The adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines
but also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,
full retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor
pansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Impressive results on real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) have been
achieved by employing pre-trained stable diffusion (SD) models. However, one
critical issue of such methods lies in their poor reconstruction of image fine
structures, such as small characters and textures, due to the aggressive
resolution reduction of the VAE (eg., 8$\times$ downsampling) in the SD model.
One solution is to employ a VAE with a lower downsampling rate for diffusion;
however, adapting its latent features with the pre-trained UNet while
mitigating the increased computational cost poses new challenges. To address
these issues, we propose a Transfer VAE Training (TVT) strategy to transfer the
8$\times$ downsampled VAE into a 4$\times$ one while adapting to the
pre-trained UNet. Specifically, we first train a 4$\times$ decoder based on the
output features of the original VAE encoder, then train a 4$\times$ encoder
while keeping the newly trained decoder fixed. Such a TVT strategy aligns the
new encoder-decoder pair with the original VAE latent space while enhancing
image fine details. Additionally, we introduce a compact VAE and
compute-efficient UNet by optimizing their network architectures, reducing the
computational cost while capturing high-resolution fine-scale features.
Experimental results demonstrate that our TVT method significantly improves
fine-structure preservation, which is often compromised by other SD-based
methods, while requiring fewer FLOPs than state-of-the-art one-step diffusion
models. The official code can be found at https://github.com/Joyies/TVT.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The existing methods for fake news videos detection may not be generalized,
because there is a distribution shift between short video news of different
events, and the performance of such techniques greatly drops if news records
are coming from emergencies. We propose a new fake news videos detection
framework (T$^3$SVFND) using Test-Time Training (TTT) to alleviate this
limitation, enhancing the robustness of fake news videos detection.
Specifically, we design a self-supervised auxiliary task based on Mask Language
Modeling (MLM) that masks a certain percentage of words in text and predicts
these masked words by combining contextual information from different
modalities (audio and video). In the test-time training phase, the model adapts
to the distribution of test data through auxiliary tasks. Extensive experiments
on the public benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model,
especially for the detection of emergency news.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">As the use of artificial intelligence rapidly increases, the development of
trustworthy artificial intelligence has become important. However, recent
studies have shown that deep neural networks are susceptible to learn spurious
correlations present in datasets. To improve the reliability, we propose a
simple yet effective framework called controllable feature whitening. We
quantify the linear correlation between the target and bias features by the
covariance matrix, and eliminate it through the whitening module. Our results
systemically demonstrate that removing the linear correlations between features
fed into the last linear classifier significantly mitigates the bias, while
avoiding the need to model intractable higher-order dependencies. A particular
advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require regularization
terms or adversarial learning, which often leads to unstable optimization in
practice. Furthermore, we show that two fairness criteria, demographic parity
and equalized odds, can be effectively handled by whitening with the
re-weighted covariance matrix. Consequently, our method controls the trade-off
between the utility and fairness of algorithms by adjusting the weighting
coefficient. Finally, we validate that our method outperforms existing
approaches on four benchmark datasets: Corrupted CIFAR-10, Biased FFHQ,
WaterBirds, and Celeb-A.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable direct communication between the
brain and external devices. Recent EEG foundation models aim to learn
generalized representations across diverse BCI paradigms. However, these
approaches overlook fundamental paradigm-specific neurophysiological
distinctions, limiting their generalization ability. Importantly, in practical
BCI deployments, the specific paradigm such as motor imagery (MI) for stroke
rehabilitation or assistive robotics, is generally determined prior to data
acquisition. This paper proposes MIRepNet, the first EEG foundation model
tailored for the MI paradigm. MIRepNet comprises a high-quality EEG
preprocessing pipeline incorporating a neurophysiologically-informed channel
template, adaptable to EEG headsets with arbitrary electrode configurations.
Furthermore, we introduce a hybrid pretraining strategy that combines
self-supervised masked token reconstruction and supervised MI classification,
facilitating rapid adaptation and accurate decoding on novel downstream MI
tasks with fewer than 30 trials per class. Extensive evaluations across five
public MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and
generalized EEG models. Our code will be available on

            <p class="paper-summary">Wildlife observation plays an important role in biodiversity conservation,
necessitating robust methodologies for monitoring wildlife populations and
interspecies interactions. Recent advances in computer vision have
significantly contributed to automating fundamental wildlife observation tasks,
such as animal detection and species identification. However, accurately
identifying species from indirect evidence like footprints and feces remains
relatively underexplored, despite its importance in contributing to wildlife
monitoring. To bridge this gap, we introduce AnimalClue, the first large-scale
dataset for species identification from images of indirect evidence. Our
dataset consists of 159,605 bounding boxes encompassing five categories of
indirect clues: footprints, feces, eggs, bones, and feathers. It covers 968
species, 200 families, and 65 orders. Each image is annotated with
species-level labels, bounding boxes or segmentation masks, and fine-grained
trait information, including activity patterns and habitat preferences. Unlike
existing datasets primarily focused on direct visual features (e.g., animal
appearances), AnimalClue presents unique challenges for classification,
detection, and instance segmentation tasks due to the need for recognizing more
detailed and subtle visual features. In our experiments, we extensively
evaluate representative vision models and identify key challenges in animal
identification from their traces. Our dataset and code are available at

            <p class="paper-summary">3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a powerful representation for
high-quality scene reconstruction, offering compelling rendering quality.
However, the training process of GS often suffers from slow convergence due to
inefficient densification and suboptimal spatial distribution of Gaussian
primitives. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of the split and
clone operations during the densification phase, revealing their distinct roles
in balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Building upon
this analysis, we propose a global-to-local densification strategy, which
facilitates more efficient growth of Gaussians across the scene space,
promoting both global coverage and local refinement. To cooperate with the
proposed densification strategy and promote sufficient diffusion of Gaussian
primitives in space, we introduce an energy-guided coarse-to-fine
multi-resolution training framework, which gradually increases resolution based
on energy density in 2D images. Additionally, we dynamically prune unnecessary
Gaussian primitives to speed up the training. Extensive experiments on
MipNeRF-360, Deep Blending, and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our
approach significantly accelerates training,achieving over 2x speedup with
fewer Gaussian primitives and superior reconstruction performance.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">To fully expedite AI-powered chemical research, high-quality chemical
databases are the cornerstone. Automatic extraction of chemical information
from the literature is essential for constructing reaction databases, but it is
currently limited by the multimodality and style variability of chemical
information. In this work, we developed a multimodal large language model
(MLLM)-based multi-agent system for automatic chemical information extraction.
We used the MLLM's strong reasoning capability to understand the structure of
complex chemical graphics, decompose the extraction task into sub-tasks and
coordinate a set of specialized agents to solve them. Our system achieved an F1
score of 80.8% on a benchmark dataset of complex chemical reaction graphics
from the literature, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model (F1 score:
35.6%) by a significant margin. Additionally, it demonstrated consistent
improvements in key sub-tasks, including molecular image recognition, reaction
image parsing, named entity recognition and text-based reaction extraction.
This work is a critical step toward automated chemical information extraction
into structured datasets, which will be a strong promoter of AI-driven chemical

highlight the potential of temporal modeling in addressing challenges like
occlusions and extended perception range. However, existing methods either fail
to fully exploit temporal information or incur substantial computational
overhead in handling extended sequences. To tackle these challenges, we propose
MambaMap, a novel framework that efficiently fuses long-range temporal features
in the state space to construct online vectorized HD maps. Specifically,
MambaMap incorporates a memory bank to store and utilize information from
historical frames, dynamically updating BEV features and instance queries to
improve robustness against noise and occlusions. Moreover, we introduce a
gating mechanism in the state space, selectively integrating dependencies of
map elements in high computational efficiency. In addition, we design
innovative multi-directional and spatial-temporal scanning strategies to
enhance feature extraction at both BEV and instance levels. These strategies
significantly boost the prediction accuracy of our approach while ensuring
robust temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and
Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed MambaMap approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods across various splits and perception ranges. Source

            <p class="paper-summary">In this work, we address the challenge of binary lung nodule classification
(benign vs malignant) using CT images by proposing a multi-level attention
stacked ensemble of deep neural networks. Three pretrained backbones -
EfficientNet V2 S, MobileViT XXS, and DenseNet201 - are each adapted with a
custom classification head tailored to 96 x 96 pixel inputs. A two-stage
attention mechanism learns both model-wise and class-wise importance scores
from concatenated logits, and a lightweight meta-learner refines the final
prediction. To mitigate class imbalance and improve generalization, we employ
dynamic focal loss with empirically calculated class weights, MixUp
augmentation during training, and test-time augmentation at inference.
Experiments on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate exceptional performance,
achieving 98.09 accuracy and 0.9961 AUC, representing a 35 percent reduction in
error rate compared to state-of-the-art methods. The model exhibits balanced
performance across sensitivity (98.73) and specificity (98.96), with
particularly strong results on challenging cases where radiologist disagreement
was high. Statistical significance testing confirms the robustness of these
improvements across multiple experimental runs. Our approach can serve as a
robust, automated aid for radiologists in lung cancer screening.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">The automatic generation of controllable co-speech gestures has recently
gained growing attention. While existing systems typically achieve gesture
control through predefined categorical labels or implicit pseudo-labels derived
from motion examples, these approaches often compromise the rich details
present in the original motion examples. We present MECo, a framework for
motion-example-controlled co-speech gesture generation by leveraging large
language models (LLMs). Our method capitalizes on LLMs' comprehension
capabilities through fine-tuning to simultaneously interpret speech audio and
motion examples, enabling the synthesis of gestures that preserve
example-specific characteristics while maintaining speech congruence. Departing
from conventional pseudo-labeling paradigms, we position motion examples as
explicit query contexts within the prompt structure to guide gesture
generation. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
across three metrics: Fr\'echet Gesture Distance (FGD), motion diversity, and
example-gesture similarity. Furthermore, our framework enables granular control
of individual body parts and accommodates diverse input modalities including
motion clips, static poses, human video sequences, and textual descriptions.

            <p class="paper-summary">Humanoid robot technology is advancing rapidly, with manufacturers
introducing diverse heterogeneous visual perception modules tailored to
specific scenarios. Among various perception paradigms, occupancy-based
representation has become widely recognized as particularly suitable for
humanoid robots, as it provides both rich semantic and 3D geometric information
essential for comprehensive environmental understanding. In this work, we
present Humanoid Occupancy, a generalized multimodal occupancy perception
system that integrates hardware and software components, data acquisition
devices, and a dedicated annotation pipeline. Our framework employs advanced
multi-modal fusion techniques to generate grid-based occupancy outputs encoding
both occupancy status and semantic labels, thereby enabling holistic
environmental understanding for downstream tasks such as task planning and
navigation. To address the unique challenges of humanoid robots, we overcome
issues such as kinematic interference and occlusion, and establish an effective
sensor layout strategy. Furthermore, we have developed the first panoramic
occupancy dataset specifically for humanoid robots, offering a valuable
benchmark and resource for future research and development in this domain. The
network architecture incorporates multi-modal feature fusion and temporal
information integration to ensure robust perception. Overall, Humanoid
Occupancy delivers effective environmental perception for humanoid robots and
establishes a technical foundation for standardizing universal visual modules,
paving the way for the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in complex
real-world scenarios.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Scene classification of mining areas provides accurate foundational data for
geological environment monitoring and resource development planning. This study
fuses multi-source data to construct a multi-modal mine land cover scene
classification dataset. A significant challenge in mining area classification
lies in the complex spatial layout and multi-scale characteristics. By
extracting global and local features, it becomes possible to comprehensively
reflect the spatial distribution, thereby enabling a more accurate capture of
the holistic characteristics of mining scenes. We propose a dual-branch fusion
model utilizing collaborative representation to decompose global features into
a set of key semantic vectors. This model comprises three key components:(1)
Multi-scale Global Transformer Branch: It leverages adjacent large-scale
features to generate global channel attention features for small-scale
features, effectively capturing the multi-scale feature relationships. (2)
Local Enhancement Collaborative Representation Branch: It refines the attention
weights by leveraging local features and reconstructed key semantic sets,
ensuring that the local context and detailed characteristics of the mining area
are effectively integrated. This enhances the model's sensitivity to
fine-grained spatial variations. (3) Dual-Branch Deep Feature Fusion Module: It
fuses the complementary features of the two branches to incorporate more scene
information. This fusion strengthens the model's ability to distinguish and
classify complex mining landscapes. Finally, this study employs multi-loss
computation to ensure a balanced integration of the modules. The overall
accuracy of this model is 83.63%, which outperforms other comparative models.
Additionally, it achieves the best performance across all other evaluation
metrics.</p>

synthesis, achieving high fidelity and efficiency. However, their high
reconstruction quality comes at the cost of requiring a large number of
primitives. We identify this issue as stemming from the entanglement of
geometry and appearance in Gaussian Splatting. To address this, we introduce a
neural shell texture, a global representation that encodes texture information
around the surface. We use Gaussian primitives as both a geometric
representation and texture field samplers, efficiently splatting texture
features into image space. Our evaluation demonstrates that this
disentanglement enables high parameter efficiency, fine texture detail
reconstruction, and easy textured mesh extraction, all while using

            <p class="paper-summary">Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable strides,
largely driven by their ability to process increasingly long and complex
contexts, such as high-resolution images, extended video sequences, and lengthy
audio input. While this ability significantly enhances MLLM capabilities, it
introduces substantial computational challenges, primarily due to the quadratic
complexity of self-attention mechanisms with numerous input tokens. To mitigate
these bottlenecks, token compression has emerged as an auspicious and critical
approach, efficiently reducing the number of tokens during both training and
inference. In this paper, we present the first systematic survey and synthesis
of the burgeoning field of multimodal long context token compression.
Recognizing that effective compression strategies are deeply tied to the unique
characteristics and redundancies of each modality, we categorize existing
approaches by their primary data focus, enabling researchers to quickly access
and learn methods tailored to their specific area of interest: (1)
image-centric compression, which addresses spatial redundancy in visual data;
(2) video-centric compression, which tackles spatio-temporal redundancy in
dynamic sequences; and (3) audio-centric compression, which handles temporal
and spectral redundancy in acoustic signals. Beyond this modality-driven
categorization, we further dissect methods based on their underlying
mechanisms, including transformation-based, similarity-based, attention-based,
and query-based approaches. By providing a comprehensive and structured
overview, this survey aims to consolidate current progress, identify key
challenges, and inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving
domain. We also maintain a public repository to continuously track and update
the latest advances in this promising area.</p>

account the peculiar color profile of a dataset, our method introduces a color
normalization stage based on histogram equalization and fine-tuning. The
results show the ability to correctly recognize facial expressions with 83.8%
mean sensitivity and very little variance (.042) among classes. Like for

            <p class="paper-summary">Detecting text in natural scenes remains challenging, particularly for
diverse scripts and arbitrarily shaped instances where visual cues alone are
often insufficient. Existing methods do not fully leverage semantic context.
This paper introduces SAViL-Det, a novel semantic-aware vision-language model
that enhances multi-script text detection by effectively integrating textual
prompts with visual features. SAViL-Det utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model
combined with an Asymptotic Feature Pyramid Network (AFPN) for multi-scale

language-vision decoder that adaptively propagates fine-grained semantic
information from text prompts to visual features via cross-modal attention.
Furthermore, a text-to-pixel contrastive learning mechanism explicitly aligns
textual and corresponding visual pixel features. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach,
achieving state-of-the-art performance with F-scores of 84.8% on the benchmark

            <p class="paper-summary">The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances
in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image
segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.
However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when
applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods
typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks
and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.
However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due
to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we
propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that
utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency
features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters
capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex
wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients,
SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense
prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks
demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods.
This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones
and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the
efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for
adapting segment anything models.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">While illumination changes inevitably affect the quality of infrared and
visible image fusion, many outstanding methods still ignore this factor and
directly merge the information from source images, leading to modality bias in
the fused results. To this end, we propose a dynamic multi-level image fusion
network called MoCTEFuse, which applies an illumination-gated Mixture of Chiral
Transformer Experts (MoCTE) to adaptively preserve texture details and object
contrasts in balance. MoCTE consists of high- and low-illumination expert
subnetworks, each built upon the Chiral Transformer Fusion Block (CTFB). Guided
by the illumination gating signals, CTFB dynamically switches between the
primary and auxiliary modalities as well as assigning them corresponding
weights with its asymmetric cross-attention mechanism. Meanwhile, it is stacked
at multiple stages to progressively aggregate and refine modality-specific and
cross-modality information. To facilitate robust training, we propose a
competitive loss function that integrates illumination distributions with three
levels of sub-loss terms. Extensive experiments conducted on the DroneVehicle,
MSRS, TNO and RoadScene datasets show MoCTEFuse's superior fusion performance.
Finally, it achieves the best detection mean Average Precision (mAP) of 70.93%
on the MFNet dataset and 45.14% on the DroneVehicle dataset. The code and model
are released at https://github.com/Bitlijinfu/MoCTEFuse.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">We propose a universal video-level modality-awareness tracking model with
online dense temporal token learning (called {\modaltracker}). It is designed
to support various tracking tasks, including RGB, RGB+Thermal, RGB+Depth, and
RGB+Event, utilizing the same model architecture and parameters. Specifically,
our model is designed with three core goals: \textbf{Video-level Sampling}. We
expand the model's inputs to a video sequence level, aiming to see a richer
video context from an near-global perspective. \textbf{Video-level
Association}. Furthermore, we introduce two simple yet effective online dense
temporal token association mechanisms to propagate the appearance and motion
trajectory information of target via a video stream manner. \textbf{Modality
Scalable}. We propose two novel gated perceivers that adaptively learn
cross-modal representations via a gated attention mechanism, and subsequently
compress them into the same set of model parameters via a one-shot training
manner for multi-task inference. This new solution brings the following
benefits: (i) The purified token sequences can serve as temporal prompts for
the inference in the next video frames, whereby previous information is
leveraged to guide future inference. (ii) Unlike multi-modal trackers that
require independent training, our one-shot training scheme not only alleviates
the training burden, but also improves model representation. Extensive
experiments on visible and multi-modal benchmarks show that our {\modaltracker}
achieves a new \textit{SOTA} performance. The code will be available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Real-world applications, such as autonomous driving and humanoid robot
manipulation, require precise spatial perception. However, it remains
underexplored how Vision-Language Models (VLMs) recognize spatial relationships
and perceive spatial movement. In this work, we introduce a spatial evaluation
pipeline and construct a corresponding benchmark. Specifically, we categorize
spatial understanding into two main types: absolute spatial understanding,
which involves querying the absolute spatial position (e.g., left, right) of an
object within an image, and 3D spatial understanding, which includes movement
and rotation. Notably, our dataset is entirely synthetic, enabling the
generation of test samples at a low cost while also preventing dataset
contamination. We conduct experiments on multiple state-of-the-art VLMs and
observe that there is significant room for improvement in their spatial
understanding abilities. Explicitly, in our experiments, humans achieve
near-perfect performance on all tasks, whereas current VLMs attain human-level
performance only on the two simplest tasks. For the remaining tasks, the
performance of VLMs is distinctly lower than that of humans. In fact, the
best-performing Vision-Language Models even achieve near-zero scores on
multiple tasks. The dataset and code are available on

            <p class="paper-summary">Motion skeletons drive 3D character animation by transforming bone
hierarchies, but differences in proportions or structure make motion data hard
to transfer across skeletons, posing challenges for data-driven motion
synthesis. Temporal Point Clouds (TPCs) offer an unstructured, cross-compatible
motion representation. Though reversible with skeletons, TPCs mainly serve for
compatibility, not for direct motion task learning. Doing so would require data
synthesis capabilities for the TPC format, which presents unexplored challenges
regarding its unique temporal consistency and point identifiability. Therefore,
we propose PUMPS, the primordial autoencoder architecture for TPC data. PUMPS
independently reduces frame-wise point clouds into sampleable feature vectors,
from which a decoder extracts distinct temporal points using latent Gaussian
noise vectors as sampling identifiers. We introduce linear assignment-based
point pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of
expensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these
latent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing
motion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these
pre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset
supervision, matching state-of-the-art performance. When fine-tuned for motion
denoising or estimation, PUMPS outperforms many respective methods without
deviating from its generalist architecture.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Existing sports video captioning methods often focus on the action yet
overlook player identities, limiting their applicability. Although some methods
integrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player
identities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent
of the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt
generation network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which
focuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.
Specifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is
designed to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a
player identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player
names, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player
features with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual
context learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context
information. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the
multimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the
generation of descriptions with player identities. To support this work, we
construct a new benchmark called NBA-Identity, a large identity-aware
basketball video captioning dataset with 9,726 videos covering 9 major event
types. The experimental results on NBA-Identity and VC-NBA-2022 demonstrate
that our proposed model achieves advanced performance. Code and dataset are

            <p class="paper-summary">Animation colorization plays a vital role in animation production, yet
existing methods struggle to achieve color accuracy and temporal consistency.
To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AnimeColor}, a novel
reference-based animation colorization framework leveraging Diffusion
Transformers (DiT). Our approach integrates sketch sequences into a DiT-based
video diffusion model, enabling sketch-controlled animation generation. We
introduce two key components: a High-level Color Extractor (HCE) to capture
semantic color information and a Low-level Color Guider (LCG) to extract
fine-grained color details from reference images. These components work
synergistically to guide the video diffusion process. Additionally, we employ a
multi-stage training strategy to maximize the utilization of reference image
color information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnimeColor
outperforms existing methods in color accuracy, sketch alignment, temporal
consistency, and visual quality. Our framework not only advances the state of
the art in animation colorization but also provides a practical solution for
industrial applications. The code will be made publicly available at

            <p class="paper-summary">Vision-language models (VLMs) extend the conventional large language models
by integrating visual data, enabling richer multimodal reasoning and
significantly broadens the practical applications of AI. However, including
visual inputs also brings new challenges in maintaining data quality. Empirical
evidence consistently shows that carefully curated and representative training
examples often yield superior results compared to simply increasing the
quantity of data. Inspired by this observation, we introduce a streamlined data
filtration framework that employs a compact VLM, fine-tuned on a high-quality
image-caption annotated dataset. This model effectively evaluates and filters
potential training samples based on caption and image quality and alignment.
Unlike previous approaches, which typically add auxiliary filtration modules on
top of existing full-scale VLMs, our method exclusively utilizes the inherent
evaluative capability of a purpose-built small VLM. This strategy eliminates
the need for extra modules and reduces training overhead. Our lightweight model
efficiently filters out inaccurate, noisy web data, improving image-text
alignment and caption linguistic fluency. Experimental results show that
datasets underwent high-precision filtration using our compact VLM perform on
par with, or even surpass, larger and noisier datasets gathered through
high-volume web crawling. Thus, our method provides a lightweight yet robust
solution for building high-quality vision-language training corpora. \\

there exists a significant yet often overlooked inconsistency between the

negatively impact supervised LLIE models by misleading model training. However,
this issue is largely neglected in current research. In this context, we
propose the GT-mean loss, a simple yet effective loss function directly
modeling the mean values of images from a probabilistic perspective. The
GT-mean loss is flexible, as it extends existing supervised LLIE loss functions
into the GT-mean form with minimal additional computational costs. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of the GT-mean loss results in

            <p class="paper-summary">Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by
exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs.
However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by
resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To
address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network
(WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different
cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based
multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the
alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low
and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across
modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination
variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the
representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or
misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection.
Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate
that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal
object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical
applicability.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Plant leaf disease classification is an important task in smart agriculture
which plays a critical role in sustainable production. Modern machine learning
approaches have shown unprecedented potential in this classification task which
offers an array of benefits including time saving and cost reduction. However,
most recent approaches directly employ convolutional neural networks where the
effect of the relationship between plant species and disease types on
prediction performance is not properly studied. In this study, we proposed a
new model named Multi-output Deep Supervised Classifier Chains (Mo-DsCC) which
weaves the prediction of plant species and disease by chaining the output
layers for the two labels. Mo-DsCC consists of three components: A modified
VGG-16 network as the backbone, deep supervision training, and a stack of
classification chains. To evaluate the advantages of our model, we perform
intensive experiments on two benchmark datasets Plant Village and PlantDoc.
Comparison to recent approaches, including multi-model, multi-label
(Power-set), multi-output and multi-task, demonstrates that Mo-DsCC achieves
better accuracy and F1-score. The empirical study in this paper shows that the
application of Mo-DsCC could be a useful puzzle for smart agriculture to
benefit farms and bring new ideas to industry and academia.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Online video segmentation methods excel at handling long sequences and
capturing gradual changes, making them ideal for real-world applications.
However, achieving temporally consistent predictions remains a challenge,
especially with gradual accumulation of noise or drift in on-line propagation,
abrupt occlusions and scene transitions. This paper introduces Local2Global, an
online framework, for video instance segmentation, exhibiting state-of-the-art
performance with simple baseline and training purely in online fashion.
Leveraging the DETR-based query propagation framework, we introduce two novel
sets of queries:(1) local queries that capture initial object-specific spatial
features from each frame and (2) global queries containing past spatio-temporal
representations. We propose the L2G-aligner, a novel lightweight transformer
decoder, to facilitate an early alignment between local and global queries.
This alignment allows our model to effectively utilize current frame
information while maintaining temporal consistency, producing a smooth
transition between frames. Furthermore, L2G-aligner is integrated within the
segmentation model, without relying on additional complex heuristics, or memory
mechanisms. Extensive experiments across various challenging VIS and VPS
datasets showcase the superiority of our method with simple online training,
surpassing current benchmarks without bells and rings. For instance, we achieve
54.3 and 49.4 AP on Youtube-VIS-19/-21 datasets and 37.0 AP on OVIS dataset
respectively withthe ResNet-50 backbone.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Crowd evacuation simulation is critical for enhancing public safety, and
demanded for realistic virtual environments. Current mainstream evacuation
models overlook the complex human behaviors that occur during evacuation, such
as pedestrian collisions, interpersonal interactions, and variations in
behavior influenced by terrain types or individual body shapes. This results in
the failure to accurately simulate the escape of people in the real world. In
this paper, aligned with the sensory-decision-motor (SDM) flow of the human
brain, we propose a real-time 3D crowd evacuation simulation framework that
integrates a 3D-adaptive SFM (Social Force Model) Decision Mechanism and a
Personalized Gait Control Motor. This framework allows multiple agents to move
in parallel and is suitable for various scenarios, with dynamic crowd
awareness. Additionally, we introduce Part-level Force Visualization to assist
in evacuation analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework
supports dynamic trajectory planning and personalized behavior for each agent
throughout the evacuation process, and is compatible with uneven terrain.
Visually, our method generates evacuation results that are more realistic and
plausible, providing enhanced insights for crowd simulation. The code is

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent breakthroughs in Visual Language Models (VLMs) and Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly advanced 3D scene perception towards
language-driven cognition. However, existing 3D language models struggle with
sparse, large-scale point clouds due to slow feature extraction and limited
representation accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose NeuroVoxel-LM,
a novel framework that integrates Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) with dynamic
resolution voxelization and lightweight meta-embedding. Specifically, we
introduce a Dynamic Resolution Multiscale Voxelization (DR-MSV) technique that
adaptively adjusts voxel granularity based on geometric and structural
complexity, reducing computational cost while preserving reconstruction
fidelity. In addition, we propose the Token-level Adaptive Pooling for
Lightweight Meta-Embedding (TAP-LME) mechanism, which enhances semantic
representation through attention-based weighting and residual fusion.
Experimental results demonstrate that DR-MSV significantly improves point cloud
feature extraction efficiency and accuracy, while TAP-LME outperforms
conventional max-pooling in capturing fine-grained semantics from NeRF weights.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">This study proposes a reconstruction-based framework for detecting medial
epicondyle avulsion in elbow ultrasound images, trained exclusively on normal
cases. Medial epicondyle avulsion, commonly observed in baseball players,
involves bone detachment and deformity, often appearing as discontinuities in
bone contour. Therefore, learning the structure and continuity of normal bone
is essential for detecting such abnormalities. To achieve this, we propose a
masked autoencoder-based, structure-aware reconstruction framework that learns
the continuity of normal bone structures. Even in the presence of avulsion, the
model attempts to reconstruct the normal structure, resulting in large
reconstruction errors at the avulsion site. For evaluation, we constructed a
novel dataset comprising normal and avulsion ultrasound images from 16 baseball
players, with pixel-level annotations under orthopedic supervision. Our method
outperformed existing approaches, achieving a pixel-wise AUC of 0.965 and an
image-wise AUC of 0.967. The dataset is publicly available at:

            <p class="paper-summary">Hyperspectral image denoising faces the challenge of multi-dimensional
coupling of spatially non-uniform noise and spectral correlation interference.
Existing deep learning methods mostly focus on RGB images and struggle to
effectively handle the unique spatial-spectral characteristics and complex
noise distributions of hyperspectral images (HSI). This paper proposes an HSI
denoising framework, Hybrid-Domain Synergistic Transformer Network (HDST),
based on frequency domain enhancement and multiscale modeling, achieving
three-dimensional collaborative processing of spatial, frequency and channel
domains. The method innovatively integrates three key mechanisms: (1)
introducing an FFT preprocessing module with multi-band convolution to extract
cross-band correlations and decouple spectral noise components; (2) designing a
dynamic cross-domain attention module that adaptively fuses spatial domain
texture features and frequency domain noise priors through a learnable gating
mechanism; (3) building a hierarchical architecture where shallow layers
capture global noise statistics using multiscale atrous convolution, and deep
layers achieve detail recovery through frequency domain postprocessing.
Experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that HDST
significantly improves denoising performance while maintaining computational
efficiency, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research
provides new insights and a universal framework for addressing complex noise
coupling issues in HSI and other high-dimensional visual data. The code is

            <p class="paper-summary">Diffusion models have become a powerful backbone for text-to-image
generation, enabling users to synthesize high-quality visuals from natural
language prompts. However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving
multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the
generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting
their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper,
we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt
Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style
tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at
different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in
the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic
consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich
prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including
Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach
outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics,
offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based
generation.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in human
image generation with various control signals such as pose priors. In portrait
generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are
crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the
accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire
image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we
propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human
image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to
enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to
maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the
importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on

            <p class="paper-summary">Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), image
captioning often suffers from a lack of detail, with base models producing
short, generic captions. This limitation persists even though VLMs are equipped
with strong vision and language backbones. While supervised data and complex
reward functions have been proposed to improve detailed image captioning, we
identify a simpler underlying issue: a bias towards the end-of-sequence (EOS)
token, which is introduced during cross-entropy training. We propose an
unsupervised method to debias the model's tendency to predict the EOS token
prematurely. By reducing this bias, we encourage the generation of longer, more
detailed captions without the need for intricate reward functions or
supervision. Our approach is straightforward, effective, and easily applicable
to any pretrained model. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments
with three VLMs and on three detailed captioning benchmarks. Our results show a
substantial increase in caption length and relevant details, albeit with an
expected increase in the rate of hallucinations.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Accurate medical image segmentation remains challenging due to blurred lesion
boundaries (LBA), loss of high-frequency details (LHD), and difficulty in
modeling long-range anatomical structures (DC-LRSS). Vision Mamba employs
one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global
dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch
tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a
low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information
Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation
(2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose
FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through
two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM)
restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing
multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A
Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level
reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial
correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive
evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg
endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive
CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior
boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without

            <p class="paper-summary">In spacecraft Rendezvous, Proximity Operations (RPO), and Formation Flying
(FF), the Guidance Navigation and Control (GNC) system is safety-critical and
must meet strict performance requirements. However, validating such systems is
challenging due to the complexity of the space environment, necessitating a
verification and validation (V&V) process that bridges simulation and
real-world behavior. The key contribution of this paper is a unified,
end-to-end digital and robotic twinning framework that enables software- and
hardware-in-the-loop testing for multi-modal GNC systems. The robotic twin
includes three testbeds at Stanford's Space Rendezvous Laboratory (SLAB): the
GNSS and Radiofrequency Autonomous Navigation Testbed for Distributed Space
Systems (GRAND) to validate RF-based navigation techniques, and the Testbed for
Rendezvous and Optical Navigation (TRON) and Optical Stimulator (OS) to
validate vision-based methods. The test article for this work is an integrated
multi-modal GNC software stack for RPO and FF developed at SLAB. This paper
introduces the hybrid framework and summarizes calibration and error
characterization for the robotic twin. Then, the GNC stack's performance and
robustness is characterized using the integrated digital and robotic twinning
pipeline for a full-range RPO mission scenario in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). The
results shown in the paper demonstrate consistency between digital and robotic
twins, validating the hybrid twinning pipeline as a reliable framework for
realistic assessment and verification of GNC systems.</p>

            <p class="paper-summary">Test-Time Optimization enables models to adapt to new data during inference
by updating parameters on-the-fly. Recent advances in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have explored learning prompts at test time to improve performance in
downstream tasks. In this work, we extend this idea by addressing a more
general and practical challenge: Can we effectively utilize an oracle in a
continuous data stream where only one sample is available at a time, requiring
an immediate query decision while respecting latency and memory constraints? To
tackle this, we propose a novel Test-Time Active Learning (TTAL) framework that
adaptively queries uncertain samples and updates prompts dynamically. Unlike
prior methods that assume batched data or multiple gradient updates, our
approach operates in a real-time streaming scenario with a single test sample
per step. We introduce a dynamically adjusted entropy threshold for active
querying, a class-balanced replacement strategy for memory efficiency, and a
class-aware distribution alignment technique to enhance adaptation. The design
choices are justified using careful theoretical analysis. Extensive experiments
across 10 cross-dataset transfer benchmarks and 4 domain generalization
datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining reasonable latency and memory overhead. Our framework
provides a practical and effective solution for real-world deployment in
safety-critical applications such as autonomous systems and medical
diagnostics.</p>
