        "summary": "A fundamental dilemma in generative modeling persists: iterative diffusion\nmodels achieve outstanding fidelity, but at a significant computational cost,\nwhile efficient few-step alternatives are constrained by a hard quality\nceiling. This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from\nrestrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal\ndynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by\nintroducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically\ndefines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a\nnovel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to\narbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory\nfrom single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having\nonly 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing\nleading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across\nall evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,\nTiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget\nincreases. Additionally, when employing our native-resolution strategy, TiM\ndelivers exceptional fidelity at resolutions up to 4096x4096.",

Different from visual generation, the\noccupancy world model must capture the fine-grained 3D geometry and dynamic\nevolution of the 3D scenes, posing great challenges for the generative models.\nRecent approaches based on autoregression (AR) have demonstrated the potential\nto predict vehicle movement and future occupancy scenes simultaneously from\nhistorical observations, but they typically suffer from \\textbf{inefficiency},\n\\textbf{temporal degradation} in long-term generation and \\textbf{lack of\ncontrollability}. To holistically address these issues, we reformulate the\noccupancy world model as a temporal next-scale prediction (TENS) task, which\ndecomposes the temporal sequence modeling problem into the modeling of spatial\nscale-by-scale generation and temporal scene-by-scene prediction. With a\n\\textbf{TensFormer}, OccTENS can effectively manage the temporal causality and\nspatial relationships of occupancy sequences in a flexible and scalable way. To\nenhance the pose controllability, we further propose a holistic pose\naggregation strategy, which features a unified sequence modeling for occupancy\nand ego-motion.

However, adapting\nthese models to new fine-grained domains remains difficult due to reliance on\nprompt engineering and the high cost of full model fine-tuning. Existing\nadaptation approaches rely on augmented components, such as prompt tokens and\nadapter modules, which could limit adaptation quality, destabilize the model,\nand compromise the rich knowledge learned during pretraining. In this work, we\npresent \\textbf{CLIP-SVD}, a novel \\textit{multi-modal} and\n\\textit{parameter-efficient} adaptation technique that leverages Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD) to modify the internal parameter space of CLIP without\ninjecting additional modules.

This design enables enhanced\nadaptation performance using only \\textbf{0.04\\%} of the model's total\nparameters and better preservation of its generalization ability. CLIP-SVD\nachieves state-of-the-art classification results on 11 natural and 10\nbiomedical datasets, outperforming previous methods in both accuracy and\ngeneralization under few-shot settings.

Recent\nadvancements in radiance field rendering have achieved unprecedented\nphotorealism and real-time performance for personalized dynamic human avatars.\nHowever, these approaches are typically limited to person-specific rendering\nmodels trained on multi-view video data for a single individual, limiting their\nability to generalize across different identities. On the other hand,\ngenerative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion\nmodels can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through\nsimple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these\nmethods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific\nrendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth\nwrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths\nof person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable\ndynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic\npose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we\noptimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a\ndynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In\nthe second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network\nweights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,\ncontrollable rendering of dynamic human avatars.

However, existing methods often lack an\nunderstanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate\nnegative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels\nsignificantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we\npropose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative\nimages and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive\nnegative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance\nfar-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the\nin-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that\nare visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning\ncapability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to\nthis subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD\ndetection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an\nadaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task\nsettings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior\nknowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet\nbenchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\\%, establishing a\nnew state-of-the-art.

        "summary": "Driven by the demand for spatial intelligence and holistic scene perception,\nomnidirectional images (ODIs), which provide a complete 360\\textdegree{} field\nof view, are receiving growing attention across diverse applications such as\nvirtual reality, autonomous driving, and embodied robotics. Despite their\nunique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective\nimages in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,\nmaking it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This\nsurvey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on\nthe perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging\npipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for\nanalyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of\ndomain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform\nsampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.\nBuilding on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300\nresearch papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method\nanalysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific\nchallenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task\ncomparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual\nquality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal\nunderstanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges\nand future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the\nadvancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new\ninsight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of\npanoramic vision technologies.

        "title": "The Telephone Game: Evaluating Semantic Drift in Unified Models",
        "summary": "Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding\n(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened\na new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also\nsupport broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus\non the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding\nand generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider\nthese capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such\nas MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a\nmodel that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is\npreserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we\nintroduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a\ncyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple\ngenerations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean\nCumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;\n(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)\nMulti-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending\nGenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in\ntraining; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and\nevaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in\ncross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many\nalternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong\nsingle-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary\ncomplement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics\nto consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of\ntheir shared representations.

To enable high-fidelity and spatially\nconsistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference\nnetworks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute\nimages into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model\nusing a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the\nsame portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as\nthe target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on\nthese inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of\nattributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy\nusing keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we\nfurther augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and\nappearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional\nmisalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively\ngeneralize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations,\ndespite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and\nnotably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a\nsingle generation pass without additional training.",

        "summary": "Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps\nduring inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly\nConsistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in\naccelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex\n3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for\nfew-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:\ndistilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly\nlearning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this\nintegral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two\noptimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),\nto equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the\nvelocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns\nto stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but\ninevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)\nfurther enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity\nfields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the\npioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of\neach flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s\n(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high\nvisual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables\nTRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.",

        "summary": "Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields\nand 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer\nto 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto\n3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and\ntransfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.\nAdditionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and\nseparation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or\nobjects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\n3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from\npretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,\nwe leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.\nThen, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This\nprocess incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style\nalignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of\nthe UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures\nthat the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style\nfidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style\ntransfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across\nstylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in\na more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D\nstyle transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree\nenvironments.

        "summary": "Aesthetic Image Captioning (AIC) aims to generate textual descriptions of\nimage aesthetics, becoming a key research direction in the field of\ncomputational aesthetics. In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in\nimage aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.\nHowever, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on\npredicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.\nExisting AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods\nwithout specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To\naddress this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal\nLarge Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly\nincorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce\nthe Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively\nextracts aesthetic saliency features from images. Additionally, we design\nIAS-ViT as the image encoder for MLLMs, this module fuses aesthetic saliency\nfeatures with original image features via a cross-attention mechanism. To the\nbest of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image\naesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrated that our approach significantly outperformed traditional methods\nand generic MLLMs on current mainstream AIC benchmarks, achieving\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.",

        "summary": "Leveraging visual priors from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) generative\nmodels has shown success in dense prediction. However, dense prediction is\ninherently an image-to-image task, suggesting that image editing models, rather\nthan T2I generative models, may be a more suitable foundation for fine-tuning.\n  Motivated by this, we conduct a systematic analysis of the fine-tuning\nbehaviors of both editors and generators for dense geometry estimation. Our\nfindings show that editing models possess inherent structural priors, which\nenable them to converge more stably by ``refining\" their innate features, and\nultimately achieve higher performance than their generative counterparts.\n  Based on these findings, we introduce \\textbf{FE2E}, a framework that\npioneeringly adapts an advanced editing model based on Diffusion Transformer\n(DiT) architecture for dense geometry prediction. Specifically, to tailor the\neditor for this deterministic task, we reformulate the editor's original flow\nmatching loss into the ``consistent velocity\" training objective. And we use\nlogarithmic quantization to resolve the precision conflict between the editor's\nnative BFloat16 format and the high precision demand of our tasks.\nAdditionally, we leverage the DiT's global attention for a cost-free joint\nestimation of depth and normals in a single forward pass, enabling their\nsupervisory signals to mutually enhance each other.\n  Without scaling up the training data, FE2E achieves impressive performance\nimprovements in zero-shot monocular depth and normal estimation across multiple\ndatasets.

Then, we leverage the CATS module for semantic propagation and\nconnection to enable precise semantic information dissemination across time.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multiple key indicators on two benchmark\ndatasets, LLP and UnAV-100.",

        "title": "SMooGPT: Stylized Motion Generation using Large Language Models",
        "summary": "Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,\nespecially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of\nthis task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and\nthe desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing\nresearch attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or\nconditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a\nlatent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite\nthe progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,\nlimited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than\n``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this\npaper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new\nperspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)\nhuman motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a\nbody-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and\nreason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently\ncompositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation\nvia effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an\nintermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a\nreasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.\nOur method executes in the body-part text space with much higher\ninterpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving\npotential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to\nnew styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive\nexperiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized\nmotion generation.",

In LML, the majority class\nof instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to\ntrain a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using\nthe majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,\nincluding pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer\nsentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a\nCounting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by\ncounting the number of instances in each class.

        "title": "Detecting Regional Spurious Correlations in Vision Transformers via Token Discarding",
        "summary": "Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based\ncomputer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended\npatterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on\nincorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may\nvary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In\nsituations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,\nmodels can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for\nmaking predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,\nwhere patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually\ncoincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations\nhave become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable\nmachine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect\nspurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network\narchitecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both\nsupervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale\nexperiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed\nmethod to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same\narchitecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the\nmodel's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain\nclasses in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily\ndetected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious\nsignals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the\naforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research\nefforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in\ninvasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world\nscenarios.",

        "summary": "Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic\noccupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike\nbird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D\nplane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial\nstructures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the\nvertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis\ninformation when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style\nchannel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting\ntheir ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal\nframework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract\nvoxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical\nslices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained\nspatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose\nthe SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through\naverage pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height\nlayer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy\ndatasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving\nespecially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation\nstudies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc\nframework.",

To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework\nfor evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,\nspanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects\nof prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight\nopen-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:\nMMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench.

        "summary": "Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive\n3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and\ntransmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based\nend-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on\nsingle-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios\nunderexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding\n(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while\nenhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively\nleveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance\ndependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion\ncorrelation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction\nmethod that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded\nindependent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model\nthat learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content\ncorrelation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module\nthat predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content\nfeatures, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures\ninter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC\nframework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC\nstandard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research\nin this field.",

In the challenging setting\nof matching across different categories, the function of an object, i.e., the\neffect that an object can cause on other objects, can guide how correspondences\nshould be established. This is because object parts that enable specific\nfunctions often share similarities in shape and appearance. We derive the\ndefinition of dense functional correspondence based on this observation and\npropose a weakly-supervised learning paradigm to tackle the prediction task.\nThe main insight behind our approach is that we can leverage vision-language\nmodels to pseudo-label multi-view images to obtain functional parts. We then\nintegrate this with dense contrastive learning from pixel correspondences to\ndistill both functional and spatial knowledge into a new model that can\nestablish dense functional correspondence.

Existing\nstate-of-the-art deep-learning TM methods extract turbulence cues from multiple\ndegraded frames to find the so-called \"lucky'', not distorted patch, for \"lucky\nfusion''. However, it requires high-capacity network to learn from\ncoarse-grained turbulence dynamics between synchronous frames with limited\nframe-rate, thus fall short in computational and storage efficiency. Event\ncameras, with microsecond-level temporal resolution, have the potential to\nfundamentally address this bottleneck with efficient sparse and asynchronous\nimaging mechanism. In light of this, we (i) present the fundamental\n\\textbf{``event-lucky insight''} to reveal the correlation between turbulence\ndistortions and inverse spatiotemporal distribution of event streams. Then,\nbuild upon this insight, we (ii) propose a novel EGTM framework that extracts\npixel-level reliable turbulence-free guidance from the explicit but noisy\nturbulent events for temporal lucky fusion. Moreover, we (iii) build the first\nturbulence data acquisition system to contribute the first real-world\nevent-driven TM dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach significantly surpass the existing SOTA TM method by 710 times, 214\ntimes and 224 times in model size, inference latency and model complexity\nrespectively, while achieving the state-of-the-art in restoration quality\n(+0.94 PSNR and +0.08 SSIM) on our real-world EGTM dataset.

However, most of the existing CLIP-based prompt learning methods only\nshow a limited ability for handling fine-grained datasets. To address this\nissue, we propose a causality-guided text prompt learning method via visual\ngranulation for CLIP, called CaPL, where the explored visual granulation\ntechnique could construct sets of visual granules for the text prompt to\ncapture subtle discrepancies among different fine-grained classes through\ncasual inference. The CaPL method contains the following two modules: (1) An\nattribute disentanglement module is proposed to decompose visual features into\nnon-individualized attributes (shared by some classes) and individualized\nattributes (specific to single classes) using a Brownian Bridge Diffusion\nModel; (2) A granule learning module is proposed to construct visual granules\nby integrating the aforementioned attributes for recognition under two causal\ninference strategies. Thanks to the learned visual granules, more\ndiscriminative text prompt is expected to be learned. Extensive experimental\nresults on 15 datasets demonstrate that our CaPL method significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art prompt learning methods, especially on\nfine-grained datasets.",

        "summary": "Cooperative perception through Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication\noffers significant potential for enhancing vehicle perception by mitigating\nocclusions and expanding the field of view. However, past research has\npredominantly focused on improving accuracy metrics without addressing the\ncrucial system-level considerations of efficiency, latency, and real-world\ndeployability. Noticeably, most existing systems rely on full-precision models,\nwhich incur high computational and transmission costs, making them impractical\nfor real-time operation in resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we\nintroduce \\textbf{QuantV2X}, the first fully quantized multi-agent system\ndesigned specifically for efficient and scalable deployment of multi-modal,\nmulti-agent V2X cooperative perception. QuantV2X introduces a unified\nend-to-end quantization strategy across both neural network models and\ntransmitted message representations that simultaneously reduces computational\nload and transmission bandwidth. Remarkably, despite operating under low-bit\nconstraints, QuantV2X achieves accuracy comparable to full-precision systems.\nMore importantly, when evaluated under deployment-oriented metrics, QuantV2X\nreduces system-level latency by 3.2$\\times$ and achieves a +9.5 improvement in\nmAP30 over full-precision baselines. Furthermore, QuantV2X scales more\neffectively, enabling larger and more capable models to fit within strict\nmemory budgets. These results highlight the viability of a fully quantized\nmulti-agent intermediate fusion system for real-world deployment. The system\nwill be publicly released to promote research in this field:\nhttps://github.com/ucla-mobility/QuantV2X.",

Learning-based approaches are\nconstrained by the scarcity of ground-truth HDR environment maps, which are\nexpensive to capture and limited in diversity. While recent generative models\noffer strong priors for image synthesis, lighting estimation remains difficult\ndue to its reliance on indirect visual cues, the need to infer global\n(non-local) context, and the recovery of high-dynamic-range outputs. We propose\nLuxDiT, a novel data-driven approach that fine-tunes a video diffusion\ntransformer to generate HDR environment maps conditioned on visual input.\nTrained on a large synthetic dataset with diverse lighting conditions, our\nmodel learns to infer illumination from indirect visual cues and generalizes\neffectively to real-world scenes.

Existing approaches\npredominantly rely on text-only supervision, which fails to provide the\ngeometric constraints required for learning robust 3D spatial representations.\nIn this paper, we introduce Reg3D, a novel Reconstructive Geometry Instruction\nTuning framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating geometry-aware\nsupervision directly into the training process. Our key insight is that\neffective 3D understanding necessitates reconstructing underlying geometric\nstructures rather than merely describing them. Unlike existing methods that\ninject 3D information solely at the input level, Reg3D adopts a\ndual-supervision paradigm that leverages 3D geometric information both as input\nand as explicit learning targets. Specifically, we design complementary\nobject-level and frame-level reconstruction tasks within a dual-encoder\narchitecture, enforcing geometric consistency to encourage the development of\nspatial reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on ScanQA, Scan2Cap,\nScanRefer, and SQA3D demonstrate that Reg3D delivers substantial performance\nimprovements, establishing a new training paradigm for spatially aware\nmultimodal models.",

        "summary": "Real world images frequently exhibit multiple overlapping biases, including\ntextures, watermarks, gendered makeup, scene object pairings, etc. These biases\ncollectively impair the performance of modern vision models, undermining both\ntheir robustness and fairness. Addressing these biases individually proves\ninadequate, as mitigating one bias often permits or intensifies others. We\ntackle this multi bias problem with Generalized Multi Bias Mitigation (GMBM), a\nlean two stage framework that needs group labels only while training and\nminimizes bias at test time. First, Adaptive Bias Integrated Learning (ABIL)\ndeliberately identifies the influence of known shortcuts by training encoders\nfor each attribute and integrating them with the main backbone, compelling the\nclassifier to explicitly recognize these biases. Then Gradient Suppression Fine\nTuning prunes those very bias directions from the backbone's gradients, leaving\na single compact network that ignores all the shortcuts it just learned to\nrecognize. Moreover we find that existing bias metrics break under subgroup\nimbalance and train test distribution shifts, so we introduce Scaled Bias\nAmplification (SBA): a test time measure that disentangles model induced bias\namplification from distributional differences. We validate GMBM on FB CMNIST,\nCelebA, and COCO, where we boost worst group accuracy, halve multi attribute\nbias amplification, and set a new low in SBA even as bias complexity and\ndistribution shifts intensify, making GMBM the first practical, end to end\nmultibias solution for visual recognition.

        "summary": "Counting mitotic figures is time-intensive for pathologists and leads to\ninter-observer variability. Artificial intelligence (AI) promises a solution by\nautomatically detecting mitotic figures while maintaining decision consistency.\nHowever, AI tools are susceptible to domain shift, where a significant drop in\nperformance can occur due to differences in the training and testing sets,\nincluding morphological diversity between organs, species, and variations in\nstaining protocols. Furthermore, the number of mitoses is much less than the\ncount of normal nuclei, which introduces severely imbalanced data for the\ndetection task. In this work, we formulate mitosis detection as a pixel-level\nsegmentation and propose a teacher-student model that simultaneously addresses\nmitosis detection (Track 1) and atypical mitosis classification (Track 2). Our\nmethod is based on a UNet segmentation backbone that integrates domain\ngeneralization modules, namely contrastive representation learning and\ndomain-adversarial training. A teacher-student strategy is employed to generate\npixel-level pseudo-masks not only for annotated mitoses and hard negatives but\nalso for normal nuclei, thereby enhancing feature discrimination and improving\nrobustness against domain shift. For the classification task, we introduce a\nmulti-scale CNN classifier that leverages feature maps from the segmentation\nmodel within a multi-task learning paradigm. On the preliminary test set, the\nalgorithm achieved an F1 score of 0.7660 in Track 1 and balanced accuracy of\n0.8414 in Track 2, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating\nsegmentation-based detection and classification into a unified framework for\nrobust mitosis analysis.",

To address the inherent challenges, we first reconstruct each\narticulation independently using recent advances in sparse-view 3D\nreconstruction, then learn a deformation field that establishes dense\ncorrespondences across poses. A progressive disentanglement strategy further\nseparates static from moving parts, enabling robust separation of camera and\nobject motion. Finally, we jointly optimize geometry, appearance, and\nkinematics with a self-supervised loss that enforces cross-view and cross-pose\nconsistency. Experiments on the standard benchmark and real-world examples\ndemonstrate that our method produces accurate and detailed articulated object\nrepresentations under significantly weaker input assumptions than existing\napproaches.",

        "title": "TensoIS: A Step Towards Feed-Forward Tensorial Inverse Subsurface Scattering for Perlin Distributed Heterogeneous Media",
        "summary": "Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a\nseverely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing\napproaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,\napproximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering\ntechniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have\napplied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,\nbut they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is\nknown to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters\nin the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal\nPerlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of\nnatural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create\nHeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of\nheterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal\nPerlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a\nlearning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed\nheterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.\nInstead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses\nlearnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We\nevaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the\nHeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source\nrealistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its\neffectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to\nexplore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined\ndistribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous\nscattering in a feed-forward manner.",

This design, dubbed global-to-local,\nstems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only\nbe afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient\nlocal feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular\nenabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are\noften missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based\nre-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In\nthis work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global\nretrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global\nfeature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global\nfeatures are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval\nsimilarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional\nscaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities\nobtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.\nExperimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new\nstate-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.",

        "summary": "Existing RGB-Event detection methods process the low-information regions of\nboth modalities (background in images and non-event regions in event data)\nuniformly during feature extraction and fusion, resulting in high computational\ncosts and suboptimal performance. To mitigate the computational redundancy\nduring feature extraction, researchers have respectively proposed token\nsparsification methods for the image and event modalities. However, these\nmethods employ a fixed number or threshold for token selection, hindering the\nretention of informative tokens for samples with varying complexity. To achieve\na better balance between accuracy and efficiency, we propose FocusMamba, which\nperforms adaptive collaborative sparsification of multimodal features and\nefficiently integrates complementary information. Specifically, an Event-Guided\nMultimodal Sparsification (EGMS) strategy is designed to identify and\nadaptively discard low-information regions within each modality by leveraging\nscene content changes perceived by the event camera. Based on the\nsparsification results, a Cross-Modality Focus Fusion (CMFF) module is proposed\nto effectively capture and integrate complementary features from both\nmodalities.

Yet, deploying\nhigh-precision models on edge devices is challenging. Most lightweight networks\nuse attention mechanisms designed for generic object recognition, which poorly\ncapture subtle pathological features like irregular lesion shapes and complex\ntextures. To overcome this, we propose a twofold solution: first, using a\ntraining-free neural architecture search method (DeepMAD) to create an\nefficient network backbone for edge devices; second, introducing the\nShape-Texture Attention Module (STAM). STAM splits attention into two branches\n-- one using deformable convolutions (DCNv4) for shape awareness and the other\nusing a Gabor filter bank for texture awareness. On the public CCMT plant\ndisease dataset, our STA-Net model (with 401K parameters and 51.1M FLOPs)\nreached 89.00% accuracy and an F1 score of 88.96%. Ablation studies confirm\nSTAM significantly improves performance over baseline and standard attention\nmodels.

Unlike conventional person search,\nthis task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal\nalignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly\nrecognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models\n(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained\nanomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between\ngenerative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of\nefficient adaptation strategies for deployment.

        "summary": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have recently achieved significant progress in\nbridging visual perception and linguistic reasoning. Recently, OpenAI o3 model\nintroduced a zoom-in search strategy that effectively elicits active perception\ncapabilities in VLMs, improving downstream task performance. However, enabling\nVLMs to reason effectively over appropriate image regions remains a core\nchallenge in GUI grounding, particularly under high-resolution inputs and\ncomplex multi-element visual interactions. In this work, we propose LASER, a\nself-evolving framework that progressively endows VLMs with multi-step\nperception capabilities, enabling precise coordinate prediction. Specifically,\nour approach integrate Monte Carlo quality estimation with\nIntersection-over-Union (IoU)-based region quality evaluation to jointly\nencourage both accuracy and diversity in constructing high-quality preference\ndata. This combination explicitly guides the model to focus on\ninstruction-relevant key regions while adaptively allocating reasoning steps\nbased on task complexity. Comprehensive experiments on the ScreenSpot Pro and\nScreenSpot-v2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains, validating\nthe effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, when fine-tuned on GTA1-7B, LASER\nachieves a score of 55.7 on the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) among 7B-scale models.",

To address this issue, this study proposes a\nheterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon\naccelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with\nmillisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts\na collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and\nMLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card\nparallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight\nYOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming\na closed-loop control chain of \"detection-tracking-feedback\". Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame\ncomprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video\nstream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over\n98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision.

        "summary": "Historic urban quarters play a vital role in preserving cultural heritage\nwhile serving as vibrant spaces for tourism and everyday life. Understanding\nhow tourists perceive these environments is essential for sustainable,\nhuman-centered urban planning. This study proposes a multidimensional\nAI-powered framework for analyzing tourist perception in historic urban\nquarters using multimodal data from social media. Applied to twelve historic\nquarters in central Shanghai, the framework integrates focal point extraction,\ncolor theme analysis, and sentiment mining. Visual focus areas are identified\nfrom tourist-shared photos using a fine-tuned semantic segmentation model. To\nassess aesthetic preferences, dominant colors are extracted using a clustering\nmethod, and their spatial distribution across quarters is analyzed. Color\nthemes are further compared between social media photos and real-world street\nviews, revealing notable shifts. This divergence highlights potential gaps\nbetween visual expectations and the built environment, reflecting both\nstylistic preferences and perceptual bias. Tourist reviews are evaluated\nthrough a hybrid sentiment analysis approach combining a rule-based method and\na multi-task BERT model. Satisfaction is assessed across four dimensions:\ntourist activities, built environment, service facilities, and business\nformats. The results reveal spatial variations in aesthetic appeal and\nemotional response. Rather than focusing on a single technical innovation, this\nframework offers an integrated, data-driven approach to decoding tourist\nperception and contributes to informed decision-making in tourism, heritage\nconservation, and the design of aesthetically engaging public spaces.",

        "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a state-of-art technique to model real-world\nscenes with high quality and real-time rendering. Typically, a higher quality\nrepresentation can be achieved by using a large number of 3D Gaussians.\nHowever, using large 3D Gaussian counts significantly increases the GPU device\nmemory for storing model parameters. A large model thus requires powerful GPUs\nwith high memory capacities for training and has slower training/rendering\nlatencies due to the inefficiencies of memory access and data movement. In this\nwork, we introduce ContraGS, a method to enable training directly on compressed\n3DGS representations without reducing the Gaussian Counts, and thus with a\nlittle loss in model quality. ContraGS leverages codebooks to compactly store a\nset of Gaussian parameter vectors throughout the training process, thereby\nsignificantly reducing memory consumption. While codebooks have been\ndemonstrated to be highly effective at compressing fully trained 3DGS models,\ndirectly training using codebook representations is an unsolved challenge.\nContraGS solves the problem of learning non-differentiable parameters in\ncodebook-compressed representations by posing parameter estimation as a\nBayesian inference problem. To this end, ContraGS provides a framework that\neffectively uses MCMC sampling to sample over a posterior distribution of these\ncompressed representations. With ContraGS, we demonstrate that ContraGS\nsignificantly reduces the peak memory during training (on average 3.49X) and\naccelerated training and rendering (1.36X and 1.88X on average, respectively),\nwhile retraining close to state-of-art quality.",

We implement this paradigm in DEXOP, a passive hand\nexoskeleton designed to maximize human ability to collect rich sensory (vision\n+ tactile) data for diverse dexterous manipulation tasks in natural\nenvironments. DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers,\nproviding users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors\nthe human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of\ndemonstrated skills to the robot.

We evaluate DEXOP across a range of\ndexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect\nhigh-quality demonstration data at scale.

        "summary": "In person re-identification, re-ranking is a crucial step to enhance the\noverall accuracy by refining the initial ranking of retrieved results. Previous\nstudies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can\ncause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and\nocclusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view\nbias. In this work, we present an efficient re-ranking method that generates\nmulti-view features by aggregating neighbors' features using K-nearest Weighted\nFusion (KWF) method. Specifically, we hypothesize that features extracted from\nre-identification models are highly similar when representing the same\nidentity. Thus, we select K neighboring features in an unsupervised manner to\ngenerate multi-view features. Additionally, this study explores the weight\nselection strategies during feature aggregation, allowing us to identify an\neffective strategy. Our re-ranking approach does not require model fine-tuning\nor extra annotations, making it applicable to large-scale datasets. We evaluate\nour method on the person re-identification datasets Market1501, MSMT17, and\nOccluded-DukeMTMC. The results show that our method significantly improves\nRank@1 and mAP when re-ranking the top M candidates from the initial ranking\nresults. Specifically, compared to the initial results, our re-ranking method\nachieves improvements of 9.8%/22.0% in Rank@1 on the challenging datasets:\nMSMT17 and Occluded-DukeMTMC, respectively. Furthermore, our approach\ndemonstrates substantial enhancements in computational efficiency compared to\nother re-ranking methods.",

        "summary": "Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional\nconduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.\nAccurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for\napplications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial\nconnectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap\nmeasures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.\nAlthough topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown\npromise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global\npreservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological\nrefinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a\nholistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)\nfirst introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly\nenforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a\ncurriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct\nerrors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging\npulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial\nimprovements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\\beta_{0}$ errors\nare reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on\nthe CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving\nby nearly 10\\%.

        "summary": "Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating\nnearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These\nagents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically\nassisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,\ncurrent agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can\nlead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack\ninteraction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app\ncannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each\ninstruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and\ncorrect previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,\na mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),\nwhich includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly\nand accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence\nmobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of\nMobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark\ncharacterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require\nexternal knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval\ndemonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving\n10.3\\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.\nOur code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/liuxiaojieOutOfWorld/MobileRAG_arxiv",

Despite the\npervasiveness of this issue in practice, past SatML research has largely\nfocused on new model architectures and training algorithms to handle scarce\ntraining data, rather than modeling data conditions directly.

Although recent studies have introduced deep learning methods\nfor tree instance segmentation, these approaches require large annotated\ndatasets and substantial computational resources. As a resource-efficient\nalternative, we present a revised version of the treeX algorithm, an\nunsupervised method that combines clustering-based stem detection with region\ngrowing for crown delineation. While the original treeX algorithm was developed\nfor personal laser scanning (PLS) data, we provide two parameter presets, one\nfor ground-based laser scanning (stationary terrestrial - TLS and PLS), and one\nfor UAV-borne laser scanning (ULS). We evaluated the method on six public\ndatasets (FOR-instance, ForestSemantic, LAUTx, NIBIO MLS, TreeLearn, Wytham\nWoods) and compared it to six open-source methods (original treeX, treeiso,\nRayCloudTools, ForAINet, SegmentAnyTree, TreeLearn). Compared to the original\ntreeX algorithm, our revision reduces runtime and improves accuracy, with\ninstance detection F$_1$-score gains of +0.11 to +0.49 for ground-based data.\nFor ULS data, our preset achieves an F$_1$-score of 0.58, whereas the original\nalgorithm fails to segment any correct instances.

Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net\n(2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to\nnnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89\nfor LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster\n(1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.\nCross-dataset evaluation on an internal dataset (N=311) confirms comparable\ngeneralization.",

        "summary": "Dynamic facial expression recognition (DFER) faces significant challenges due\nto long-tailed category distributions and complexity of spatio-temporal feature\nmodeling. While existing deep learning-based methods have improved DFER\nperformance, they often fail to address these issues, resulting in severe model\ninduction bias. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\nmulti-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates\nspatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning\noptimization. Specifically, we design the Graph-Enhanced Instance Interaction\nModule (GEIIM) to capture intricate spatio-temporal between adjacent instances\nrelationships through adaptive adjacency matrices and multiscale convolutions.\nTo enhance instance-level feature aggregation, we develop the Weighted Instance\nAggregation Network (WIAN), which dynamically assigns weights based on instance\nimportance. Furthermore, we introduce a Multiscale Category-aware Contrastive\nLearning (MCCL) strategy to balance training between major and minor\ncategories. Extensive experiments on in-the-wild datasets (i.e., DFEW and\nFERV39k) demonstrate that MICACL achieves state-of-the-art performance with\nsuperior robustness and generalization.",

        "summary": "Semantic segmentation of overhead remote sensing imagery enables applications\nin mapping, urban planning, and disaster response. State-of-the-art\nsegmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective\nphotographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as\nextreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image\nsizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile\n(DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology,\ninto modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can\nprovide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior\ndetection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we\nextend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by\nintegrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and\ntransformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input,\nwhich adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP\nchannels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP\nencoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP\ndifferentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape\ninformation to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally\noutperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms\ndirect-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and\nRecall.",

        "summary": "Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest\n(ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of\ncollimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital\nradiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray\nradiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms\npolygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep\nlearning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We\nachieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to\ndetect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the\ninformation about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information\nof both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained\nsegmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions\nachieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real\nXray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our\nmethod is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.",

Existing KD and QAT works focus on improving the accuracy of quantized\nmodels from the network output perspective by designing better KD loss\nfunctions or optimizing QAT's forward and backward propagation. However,\nlimited attention has been given to understanding the impact of input\ntransformations, such as data augmentation (DA). The relationship between\nquantization-aware KD and DA remains unexplored. In this paper, we address the\nquestion: how to select a good DA in quantization-aware KD, especially for the\nmodels with low precisions? We propose a novel metric which evaluates DAs\naccording to their capacity to maximize the Contextual Mutual Information--the\ninformation not directly related to an image's label--while also ensuring the\npredictions for each class are close to the ground truth labels on average. The\nproposed method automatically ranks and selects DAs, requiring minimal training\noverhead, and it is compatible with any KD or QAT algorithm. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrate that selecting DA strategies using our metric\nsignificantly improves state-of-the-art QAT and KD works across various model\narchitectures and datasets.",
