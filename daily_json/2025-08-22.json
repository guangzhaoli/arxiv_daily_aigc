        "title": "CineScale: Free Lunch in High-Resolution Cinematic Visual Generation",
        "summary": "Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically\ntrained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and\nconstrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate\nhigh-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have\nexplored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential\nhigher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these\nmethods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive\npatterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency\ninformation when the model generates visual content exceeding its training\nresolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the\naccumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference\nparadigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various\nissues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we\npropose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods\nthat are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens\nthe scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop\nstate-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of\nhigher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.\nRemarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,\nand achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning.

        "summary": "X-ray phase contrast imaging significantly improves the visualization of\nstructures with weak or uniform absorption, broadening its applications across\na wide range of scientific disciplines. Propagation-based phase contrast is\nparticularly suitable for time- or dose-critical in vivo/in situ/operando\n(tomography) experiments because it requires only a single intensity\nmeasurement. However, the phase information of the wave field is lost during\nthe measurement and must be recovered. Conventional algebraic and iterative\nmethods often rely on specific approximations or boundary conditions that may\nnot be met by many samples or experimental setups. In addition, they require\nmanual tuning of reconstruction parameters by experts, making them less\nadaptable for complex or variable conditions. Here we present a self-learning\napproach for solving the inverse problem of phase retrieval in the near-field\nregime of Fresnel theory using a single intensity measurement (hologram). A\nphysics-informed generative adversarial network is employed to reconstruct both\nthe phase and absorbance of the unpropagated wave field in the sample plane\nfrom a single hologram. Unlike most deep learning approaches for phase\nretrieval, our approach does not require paired, unpaired, or simulated\ntraining data. This significantly broadens the applicability of our approach,\nas acquiring or generating suitable training data remains a major challenge due\nto the wide variability in sample types and experimental configurations. The\nalgorithm demonstrates robust and consistent performance across diverse imaging\nconditions and sample types, delivering quantitative, high-quality\nreconstructions for both simulated data and experimental datasets acquired at\nbeamline P05 at PETRA III (DESY, Hamburg), operated by Helmholtz-Zentrum\nHereon. Furthermore, it enables the simultaneous retrieval of both phase and\nabsorption information.",

        "summary": "Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by\nimage noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can\nreduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect\ntemporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not\naccount for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),\na method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive\nlearning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts\nfeatures from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates\nthem with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns\nthe video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge\ncontrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce\na Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which\nlearns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies\nclassification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection\nand on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA\nachieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while\nalso reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On\nEchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to\n58.62%).

        "title": "Visual Autoregressive Modeling for Instruction-Guided Image Editing",
        "summary": "Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity\nto instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process\ninherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading\nto unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing\ninstructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by\nformulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual\ntokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the\nadherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present\nVAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as\na next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text\ninstructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise\nedits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the\nsource image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot\neffectively guide the prediction of coarser target features. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects\nscale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.\nVAREdit demonstrates significant advancements in both editing adherence and\nefficiency. On standard benchmarks, it outperforms leading diffusion-based\nmethods by 30\\%+ higher GPT-Balance score. Moreover, it completes a\n$512\\times512$ editing in 1.2 seconds, making it 2.2$\\times$ faster than the\nsimilarly sized UltraEdit.

It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such\nas remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant\nadvancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality\nmisalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.\nTo address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for\ntask-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.\nAdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet\nTransform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba\nBlocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-\nand low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,\nenabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency\ncharacteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks\nfacilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing\nthis process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to\nensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,\nAdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,\nreduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments\non four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image\nFusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)\n-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low\ncomputational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between\nperformance and efficiency.

When input views become extremely sparse,\nthe Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization\nfails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,\nresulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel\nSfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs\n3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we\npropose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose\ninformation and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To\naddress the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view\nsettings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates\ncamera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent\ncontent as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we\nintroduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive\nspatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of\ngeometrical structures and rendered content.

        "summary": "3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest\ndue to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the\nchallenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene\nimage. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a\nnovel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as\ninput, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.\nNotably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;\n(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and\nglobal scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature\nextraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of\n3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;\n(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input\nscenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our\narchitectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image\ninputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the\nefficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this\nparadigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,\npotentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code\nand model will be publicly available at: https://mengmouxu.github.io/SceneGen.",

        "summary": "The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns\nabout privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in\ngenerating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on\nnumerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic\ncreations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and\ndistribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a\ntraining-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating\nvideos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those\nconcepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly\nintegrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:\nSelective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise\nGuidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including\nobject erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content\nerasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms\nprior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and\ngeneralizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nsuppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on\naverage across four tasks compared to baselines.",

        "summary": "Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images\nand require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though\ncapable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps\nfor adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free\nblack-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces\nadversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional\ndiffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the\nmixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing\nall timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies\nattention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on\ngreen and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing\nmisclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR\nabove 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,\nTAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%\nagainst ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than\nexisting diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust\naccuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism\nis least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.",

However, in real-world applications, users are often\npresented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where\nindependent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices\nand hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group\ninference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of\nsamples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment\nproblem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected\nto optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity\n(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively\nprune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to\nscale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method\nsignificantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent\nsampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes\nacross a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image\nprompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple\noutputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.",

Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD\ndata, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.\nHowever, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising\ndoubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the\nrepresentation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density\nestimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space\ntypically used in generative models.

        "summary": "Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nimpressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from\nbias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language\nmodels (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic\ninformation. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'\npre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To\naddress this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt\nRouting (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for\nclasses, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the\ndynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal\nprompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions\nthrough logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,\nincluding CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves\ncomparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm\nthe effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our\ndynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible\nand efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.",

        "summary": "Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance\nangiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as\naneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed\nthrough manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter,\nwhich often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful\ntools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on\nwell-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly\navailable MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations.\n  To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight\nneural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex\nstructures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is\na Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on\nthe CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural\nnetworks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset\nreaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually\nannotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset\n(annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the\nsupervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides\nhigh accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the\nmost complex important cases.

        "summary": "Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving\nsystems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego\nvehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have\nachieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and\nHD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale\noffline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable\ncomputational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a\nknowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models\nwith prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student\nmodel. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal\nknowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)\nparadigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with\nSD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with\nprior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge\ntransfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,\nwe introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D\nPatch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked\nSemantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance.

While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in\nholistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are\nencoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,\nand language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In\nthis paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome\nthese limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion\nTemporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains\ntemporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind\nquery entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a\nmixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp\nmodeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning.

The paper uses the YOLOv8 object\nrecognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for\nautomatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car\nexteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,\ntime-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve\nthis, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under\nvarious lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve\nrobustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and\nYOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.\nExperimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy\nand low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as\nautomated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation\nparameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and\nF1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of\n0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4\nmodel (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying\nmicroscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the\nmAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve\narea was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).\nYOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent\ndetection applications, even though its convergence is slower.",

        "summary": "Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique\nfor vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require\nextensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder\nlayers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have\nanalyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent\nvariable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on\ndownstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs\nlearn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the\nfeatures learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can\nbe used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial\ncorrelations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE\nrepresentations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond\nsecond-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE\nhyper-parameters in practice.",

        "summary": "In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,\npedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant\nchallenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian\nSplatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static\ncomponents within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook\nbackground optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on\nfitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit\nlimited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric\nrepresentation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a\nhigh-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural\nGaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate\nthe predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise\nvoxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,\nmiddle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.\nDeformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,\nwhose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.\nThe entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from\npre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method\nhas been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating\nstate-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.",

Although 3DGS compression methods\nhave been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two\nlimitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to\nthe megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or\nextensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene\nchanges after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an\nImage-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially\nenhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes\nafter archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly\nexploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared\ncodebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to\npreviously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.\nThis approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the\nkilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to\npost-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images\ncaptured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes\nare trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized\nrepresentations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We\nevaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.\nExperimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene\nchanges.

However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,\nwith limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper\naims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret\nexisting VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool\nand design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and\nLanguage-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different\nnumbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of\nlayers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a\nfine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting\nindicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,\nforming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,\nwhile higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,\ncertain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question\nanswering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute\nminimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling\nrelies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame\nself-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational\ncost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce\nattention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work\nto systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand\nvideo content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future\nresearch.",

        "summary": "Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in\ntactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.\nTraditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the\ninherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D\nreconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,\nin particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,\nas ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with\nfrequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.\n  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first\nmultimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds\nwith synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball\nenvironment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves\nimproved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR\ndataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully\nsynchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We\nrecorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball\nplayers, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for\neach player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that\nleverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method\nconsists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal\ntracking pipeline that fuses LiDAR and camera data. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves real-time operation, which was difficult\nwith conventional camera-only methods, while achieving superior tracking\nperformance even under occlusion conditions.

        "summary": "In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent\nclassification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.\nHowever, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and\nstructural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying\ncomprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead\nto ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in\nvision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more\nreliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP\nmodels to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications\nwith a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique\ncharacteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware\nclassification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions\nfor patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness\nof DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification\nand patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,\nwhich provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by\noffering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that\nDesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent\ndomain on all tasks.

Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models have\ngained popularity in unsupervised anomaly detection, achieving promising\nperformance in both natural and medical imaging datasets.

        "summary": "Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various\ngeneration tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation\nprocess, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,\nsuch as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of\nnon-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.\nHowever, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion\nprocess can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian\nprocesses. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce\nskipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate\ndenoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the\ntraditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,\nwe demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the\nsame training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that\naccelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an\nintrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an\nenhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique\nwith DDIM.

However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either\noperate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the\ncomplementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D\nstructures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To\nholistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the\nfirst feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic\nmulti-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM\nfirst introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates\nmodality-specific features while preserving their unique representational\nstrengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to\nraise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the\nembedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to\ngenerate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the\ngeometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets\ndemonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves\ncompetitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite\nutilizing a small amount of training data.

To address this, this paper proposes MeSS\n(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent\noutdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While\nimage and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth\nmaps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective\nviews, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion\nmodels excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but\noften struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with\nrendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to\nguarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned\nresults when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach\nenhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The\npipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically\nconsistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we\npropagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and\nthird, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)\nusing the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh\nsurface.

        "summary": "Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in clinical diagnosis, but acquiring\nhigh-resolution (HR) CT is limited by radiation exposure risks. Deep\nlearning-based super-resolution (SR) methods have been studied to reconstruct\nHR from low-resolution (LR) inputs. While supervised SR approaches have shown\npromising results, they require large-scale paired LR-HR volume datasets that\nare often unavailable. In contrast, zero-shot methods alleviate the need for\npaired data by using only a single LR input, but typically struggle to recover\nfine anatomical details due to limited internal information. To overcome these,\nwe propose a novel zero-shot 3D CT SR framework that leverages upsampled 2D\nX-ray projection priors generated by a diffusion model. Exploiting the\nabundance of HR 2D X-ray data, we train a diffusion model on large-scale 2D\nX-ray projection and introduce a per-projection adaptive sampling strategy. It\nselects the generative process for each projection, thus providing HR\nprojections as strong external priors for 3D CT reconstruction. These\nprojections serve as inputs to 3D Gaussian splatting for reconstructing a 3D CT\nvolume. Furthermore, we propose negative alpha blending (NAB-GS) that allows\nnegative values in Gaussian density representation. NAB-GS enables residual\nlearning between LR and diffusion-based projections, thereby enhancing\nhigh-frequency structure reconstruction. Experiments on two datasets show that\nour method achieves superior quantitative and qualitative results for 3D CT SR.",

We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and\nQuality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a\nhierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and\ncontrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine\nreferences or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality\nscores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking\nloss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across\ndistortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces\nconsistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A\ntraining-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,\nfurther enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic\ndistortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as\ndemonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,\nhaze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we\nintroduce \\textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of\nonly 3.5 ms per image.

        "summary": "Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data\nand noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can\ninadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability\nregions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does\nthe curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment\nbetween generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional\ncompliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching\nframework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly\nincorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a\nrobust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the\ntrajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017\ndemonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in\ntext-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified\nflow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The\nimprovements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as\nBLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling\nsubstantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex\ninstructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality.

        "summary": "Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage\nreversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined\nto the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To\naddress this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative\nrefinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as\na mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a\nmulti-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply\nreversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a\ndiffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network\nintegrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction\n(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core\nobject regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this\nprinciple to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;\nand a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a\nfinal refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion\nmodel that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,\nharnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration\nwithout the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique\nsynergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for\nthe diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward\nambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.\nFurthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that\nremain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a\nbroader bi-level optimization framework.",

        "summary": "Contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) is an imaging modality that\nprovides two types of images, commonly known as low-energy (LE) and dual-energy\nsubtracted (DES) images. In many domains, particularly in medicine, the\nemergence of image-to-image translation techniques has enabled the artificial\ngeneration of images using other images as input. Within CESM, applying such\ntechniques to generate DES images from LE images could be highly beneficial,\npotentially reducing patient exposure to radiation associated with high-energy\nimage acquisition. In this study, we investigated three models for the\nartificial generation of DES images (virtual DES): a pre-trained U-Net model, a\nU-Net trained end-to-end model, and a CycleGAN model. We also performed a\nseries of experiments to assess the impact of using virtual DES images on the\nclassification of CESM examinations into malignant and non-malignant\ncategories. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of\nvirtual DES images on CESM lesion classification. The results demonstrate that\nthe best performance was achieved with the pre-trained U-Net model, yielding an\nF1 score of 85.59% when using the virtual DES images, compared to 90.35% with\nthe real DES images. This discrepancy likely results from the additional\ndiagnostic information in real DES images, which contributes to a higher\nclassification accuracy. Nevertheless, the potential for virtual DES image\ngeneration is considerable and future advancements may narrow this performance\ngap to a level where exclusive reliance on virtual DES images becomes\nclinically viable.",

        "summary": "Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search\nand track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent\nyears. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the\ninformation of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the\ndetection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do\nnot consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global\ntemporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant\ncomputation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a\nBidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small\ntarget Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy\nsimultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and\nglobal temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.\nSpecifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design\na Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal\ndependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global\nTemporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the\nglobal propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the\nbidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head\nfor detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the\ntraditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)\nloss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference\nspeed.",

        "summary": "In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks\ndemanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with\nmanipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.\nHowever, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of\nintegrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic\narm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.\nTeleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high\nlevel of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load\non the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that\ndirectly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler\nand more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by\nleveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external\ncamera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist\nposition. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to\ncontrol the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe\nteleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and\nthe robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,\ndemonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation\napproach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where\nsafety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and\nintuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.",

        "summary": "Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a\nwide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by\nlearning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh\nmodeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body\nposes and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and\nrestrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes\nthe external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal\nskeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic\ndependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct\ncontrol over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present\nATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans\ncaptured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly\ndecouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in\nthe human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,\nfine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent\nof external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by\nfitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative\nevaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture\ncomplex poses compared to linear models.",

        "summary": "In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,\nachieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance\nbeing quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but\nmore challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely\non expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags\nsignificantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for\ntransforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between\nopen-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To\nmitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General\nIntelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped\nwith general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze\nmultiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nmodel with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,\ncontinually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from\nscientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and\nthen online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose\nMixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks\nsimultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and\ntraining systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL\ntraining.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates\ncompetitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and\nsignificantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing\nclosed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular\nsynthesis planning, reaction condition prediction, predicting thermodynamic\nstabilities for crystals.

        "summary": "Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under\ndistribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite\nnotable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.\nFirst, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which\nlimits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit\nmodeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial\nfor producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it\nremains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at\ntest time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and\nbackPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian\nprobabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using\ngradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables\nclosed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we\nintroduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical\nknowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full\naccess to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.\nExtensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts\nwith superior scalability and robustness.",

        "summary": "Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are\noften degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the\ndenoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep\nunfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a\nphysical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks\nconvergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the\nhidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and\nmodels them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the\noptimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium\nConvolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local\nspatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global\nspatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse\ncoding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse\nrepresentation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while\nunshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral\ndetails. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is\nembedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is\nintegrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate\nthe proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and\ntransform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within\nthe framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method\nachieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "summary": "Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and\ntreatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings\nwhere lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,\nexisting lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and\nrarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely\nrestricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,\ncurrent architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same\nconvolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature\nextraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel\nlightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet\nemploys heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency\ninformation while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model\nintegrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture\nlow-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public\ndatasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art\nmethods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot\ngeneralization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for\nreal-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios.

Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or\nmulti-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated\nby the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the\ncategory level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and\n9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional\ndata? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based\nframework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of\n2D detection.

To address these challenges, We introduce\nDeep-DxSearch, an agentic RAG system trained end-to-end with reinforcement\nlearning (RL) that enables steer tracebale retrieval-augmented reasoning for\nmedical diagnosis. In Deep-DxSearch, we first construct a large-scale medical\nretrieval corpus comprising patient records and reliable medical knowledge\nsources to support retrieval-aware reasoning across diagnostic scenarios. More\ncrutially, we frame the LLM as the core agent and the retrieval corpus as its\nenvironment, using tailored rewards on format, retrieval, reasoning structure,\nand diagnostic accuracy, thereby evolving the agentic RAG policy from\nlarge-scale data through RL.\n  Experiments demonstrate that our end-to-end agentic RL training framework\nconsistently outperforms prompt-engineering and training-free RAG approaches\nacross multiple data centers. After training, Deep-DxSearch achieves\nsubstantial gains in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing strong diagnostic\nbaselines such as GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, and other medical-specific frameworks\nfor both common and rare disease diagnosis under in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution settings.

        "summary": "Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,\nand disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2\nbuilding models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements\nessential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this\nlimitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and\nunderpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual\nmodeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,\nCM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models\nleveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.\nUnlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs\nwith synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map\nGenerator (SCMG).

        "summary": "Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be\nvulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods\noften exploit certain information about the target models, such as model\nparameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in\nrealistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the\ntarget models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on\ntransfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not\nrequire any information about the target models. Based on our observation that\nthe critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across\ndifferent DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box\nattack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via\nthe proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes\nthe search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the\nextracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are\nlikely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain\nthe maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the\nloss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted\non the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.",

        "title": "Label Uncertainty for Ultrasound Segmentation",
        "summary": "In medical imaging, inter-observer variability among radiologists often\nintroduces label uncertainty, particularly in modalities where visual\ninterpretation is subjective. Lung ultrasound (LUS) is a prime example-it\nfrequently presents a mixture of highly ambiguous regions and clearly\ndiscernible structures, making consistent annotation challenging even for\nexperienced clinicians. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to both\nlabeling and training AI models using expert-supplied, per-pixel confidence\nvalues. Rather than treating annotations as absolute ground truth, we design a\ndata annotation protocol that captures the confidence that radiologists have in\neach labeled region, modeling the inherent aleatoric uncertainty present in\nreal-world clinical data. We demonstrate that incorporating these confidence\nvalues during training leads to improved segmentation performance. More\nimportantly, we show that this enhanced segmentation quality translates into\nbetter performance on downstream clinically-critical tasks-specifically,\nestimating S/F oxygenation ratio values, classifying S/F ratio change, and\npredicting 30-day patient readmission. While we empirically evaluate many\nmethods for exposing the uncertainty to the learning model, we find that a\nsimple approach that trains a model on binarized labels obtained with a (60%)\nconfidence threshold works well. Importantly, high thresholds work far better\nthan a naive approach of a 50% threshold, indicating that training on very\nconfident pixels is far more effective. Our study systematically investigates\nthe impact of training with varying confidence thresholds, comparing not only\nsegmentation metrics but also downstream clinical outcomes. These results\nsuggest that label confidence is a valuable signal that, when properly\nleveraged, can significantly enhance the reliability and clinical utility of AI\nin medical imaging.",

        "summary": "Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a\nsignificant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and\nfrequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated\nDual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained\nroad structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the\nencoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key\ninnovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that\nenhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the\nbottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates\noriginal and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with\nsemantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)\nthat mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road\nprediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,\nD3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road\nsegments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show\nthat D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,\noutperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the\ncomplementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.\nThese results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road\nextraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.",

        "title": "DoSReMC: Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification using Batch Normalization Adaptation",
        "summary": "Numerous deep learning-based solutions have been developed for the automatic\nrecognition of breast cancer using mammography images. However, their\nperformance often declines when applied to data from different domains,\nprimarily due to domain shift - the variation in data distributions between\nsource and target domains. This performance drop limits the safe and equitable\ndeployment of AI in real-world clinical settings. In this study, we present\nDoSReMC (Domain Shift Resilient Mammography Classification), a batch\nnormalization (BN) adaptation framework designed to enhance cross-domain\ngeneralization without retraining the entire model. Using three large-scale\nfull-field digital mammography (FFDM) datasets - including HCTP, a newly\nintroduced, pathologically confirmed in-house dataset - we conduct a systematic\ncross-domain evaluation with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our results\ndemonstrate that BN layers are a primary source of domain dependence: they\nperform effectively when training and testing occur within the same domain, and\nthey significantly impair model generalization under domain shift. DoSReMC\naddresses this limitation by fine-tuning only the BN and fully connected (FC)\nlayers, while preserving pretrained convolutional filters. We further integrate\nthis targeted adaptation with an adversarial training scheme, yielding\nadditional improvements in cross-domain generalizability. DoSReMC can be\nreadily incorporated into existing AI pipelines and applied across diverse\nclinical environments, providing a practical pathway toward more robust and\ngeneralizable mammography classification systems.",

        "summary": "Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by\nmodeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between\nlanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a\nfirst-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are\nsupervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the\ndetection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology\nreasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this\npaper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology\nreasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.\nSpecifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the\ncross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane\npredictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many\nassignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with\nindependent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.\nExtensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is\nmodel-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology\nreasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic\ntopology performance.",

To address this problem, we\npropose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which\nconsists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning\nmodule. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability\nthat the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the\nprototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing\nprototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different\ntransformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples\nrespectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic\ninformation and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable\nguarantees for the calculation of prototypes.

While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for\npreliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns\nover data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.\nCurrently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types\nof surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound\nscreening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first\nopen-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It\ncontains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with\neight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce\nthe first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual\nquestion answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively\nevaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning\nframework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we\nemploy five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound\ncharacteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional\nknowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess\ninfection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train\na MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to\nproduce a comprehensive report.

This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:\nprompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for\ndirect segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a\nrange of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face\nchallenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying\nspecific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we\npropose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational\npathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This\nmodel incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging\nlay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for\ndetailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to\nemphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with\nSAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating\nMolecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results\nfrom both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model\nsignificantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with\nvarying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the\nworkload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise\nbiomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing\nmedical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.",

In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule.\nUsing a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show\nthat the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories\nthat correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have\nordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the\npresence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can\nperform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that\nthe physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized.\nInteractive visualizations of the dynamics studied in this work are available\nat https://memorynca.github.io/2D.",

        "summary": "Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across\nvarious domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains\nunresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced\nRaven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for\nevaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,\nwith a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,\npattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers\non solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract\nreasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a\n``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete\ncausal chain in RPM tasks: image $\\rightarrow$ abstract attributes\n$\\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\\rightarrow$ pattern consistency\n$\\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture\nof the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the\noptimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational\nlower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,\nfails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning\nlogic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound\nsignificantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and\nmutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal\nrelationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this\npaper progressively proposes three improvement methods:",

However, due to the extended\ntrajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN\nperformance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly\ndetailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which\ncould provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion\nspace for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV\nCollaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct\naltitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,\nand a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training\nand evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising\n13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with\ntarget-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps\nand an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's\ngeneralization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.\nTo consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV\ncollaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a\nmultimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the\nlow-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and\ntarget grounding.

To address these challenges, we propose a\nweakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result\nobtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are\nprovided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during\nthe quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to\nclassify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human\noperator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the\nrating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\\% in\nterms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the\nnumber of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over\nsparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in\nheight) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which\ncan be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is\nreduced.",

In this paper, we propose a novel linear\ntime convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and\nBound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to\nprovable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation\nis provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is\ntwo orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when\nsolving the rotation-only TLS problem.

        "summary": "Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer\nvision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.\nExisting approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational\nresources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)\noffer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without\nfine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.\nHowever, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address\nthese challenges, we propose \\textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a\ntraining-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based\nsegmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval\ndatabase via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature\nretrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that\nguide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for\nconventional training while maintaining competitive performance.

        "summary": "Lossy compression and rate-adaptive streaming are a mainstay in traditional\nvideo steams. However, a new class of neuromorphic ``event'' sensors records\nvideo with asynchronous pixel samples rather than image frames. These sensors\nare designed for computer vision applications, rather than human video\nconsumption. Until now, researchers have focused their efforts primarily on\napplication development, ignoring the crucial problem of data transmission. We\nsurvey the landscape of event-based video systems, discuss the technical issues\nwith our recent scalable event streaming work, and propose a new low-latency\nevent streaming format based on the latest additions to the Media Over QUIC\nprotocol draft.",

        "title": "\\textit{adder-viz}: Real-Time Visualization Software for Transcoding Event Video",
        "summary": "Recent years have brought about a surge in neuromorphic ``event'' video\nresearch, primarily targeting computer vision applications. Event video eschews\nvideo frames in favor of asynchronous, per-pixel intensity samples. While much\nwork has focused on a handful of representations for specific event cameras,\nthese representations have shown limitations in flexibility, speed, and\ncompressibility. We previously proposed the unified AD{\\Delta}ER representation\nto address these concerns. This paper introduces numerous improvements to the\n\\textit{adder-viz} software for visualizing real-time event transcode processes\nand applications in-the-loop.
