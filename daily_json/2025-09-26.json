        "summary": "Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges\nin achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera\nand object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn\nthese motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative\nmotion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we\npropose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by\nconverting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable\ndiffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to\nthe specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic\nobject prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the\ndesired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while\nmaintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our\nmodel outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.",

        "summary": "We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial\nand diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving\nprecise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of\nspatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the\nforeground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this\ndecomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based\narchitecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in\nthe videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on\nrandom masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from\nlarge-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning\nparadigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a\nChain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We\ndecompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and\nleverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide\nthe generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset\ncalled OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in\nvideo concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nachieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse\nreference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual\nfidelity and editability.

In this work, we\nintroduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural\ndesign inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework\nfor video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the\nvideo domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,\nor higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across\ntime - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our\ndesign explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept\nimportance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific\nwindows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results\ndemonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively\ntransferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept\ncontributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.\nCode available at github.com/patrick-knab/MoTIF.",

Despite recent advances,\nstate-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects\nfalling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction.

Their prohibitive computational and memory costs\nseverely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has\nbecome a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we\nempirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing\nbillion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed\nactivation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes\ncalibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first\nQuantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two\ntechnical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained\nQuantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local\nchannel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel\nvariance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which\nfilters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse\ncalibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results\nacross different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous\nstate-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin.

We propose SHINE, a\ntraining-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized\nErrors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained\ncustomization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject\nrepresentation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression\nguidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate\nlow-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous\nbenchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and\nchallenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate\nshadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and\nDreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,\nDINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).\nCode and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.",

        "summary": "Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their\nadvancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,\nlarge-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability\nof reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone\nto gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization\nsignals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We\npropose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by\nVariance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory\ndiversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We\nrelease large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT\ncold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,\nand diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.\n(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,\nestablishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the\ncurated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses\nprovide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,\nwe theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected\npolicy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize\nthis guarantee.

Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit\ncontinuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to\nintroducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this\nend, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs\nCross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by\nprojecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,\nenabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to\nneighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner\nState-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and\nreduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and\nlarge-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four\ndatasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract\nsurgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in\nreconstruction performance and efficiency.

Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model\nunifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a\nprogressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control\nmodality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal\npose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust\nmulti-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs.

        "summary": "Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting\nmeaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various\nclinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep\nlearning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture\nboth local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,\noffering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules\nexcels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize\nfine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these\ncomplementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an\nentropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically\nbalances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the\nbranch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the\ncontextual importance of local versus global information for different\ndownstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a\nrepresentative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our\nframework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve\n(PRAUC) of 0.751 \\pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \\pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39\n\\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \\pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \\pm 0.091), and a\nprior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \\pm 0.075).

        "summary": "Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs\ntruly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts\nremains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on\nautomated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity\nrather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported\nprogress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to\nunderstand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present\na broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.\nOur analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across\ndiverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families\nalign with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs\nconsistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional\nproblem.

        "summary": "Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign\nlanguage understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have\ngained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in\nsubjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental\nfactors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak\nsemantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from\nskeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance\nbetween local details and global context, with models either focusing too\nnarrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)\ninefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned\nrepresentations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we\npropose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a\nsign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between\nvisual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic\ncontext; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises\nagreements across different levels of paired features from different\nmodalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level\nsemantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines\ncontrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic\nconsistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on\nisolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and\ngloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different\nsign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative\npre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution\nfor SLU.",

        "summary": "We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework\nfor anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on\nrealistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime\nhairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that\nchallenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh\nmodeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and\nunsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible\ncontrol-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points\nrepresents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric\nparameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both\nartist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this\nrepresentation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that\neffectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By\ninterpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential \"hair language\", our\nautoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle\ntopology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate\nboth training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct\nAnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with\nseparated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and\ngeneration quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime\nhairstyle modeling.

We introduce the\nCrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples\ninto the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM).

        "summary": "Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future\nenvironment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of\ngenerated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world\napplications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame\ngeneration approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar\nframes, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To\naddress this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves\ntext-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation\non a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model\nto fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies\nsignificant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion\ntrajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is\ntrained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from\ntextual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently\nreconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations\non the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\\times$\nacceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing\non the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of\nthe generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a\npractical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and\nother domains requiring both efficient and effective world models.

        "summary": "Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation\nmodels, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade\nrepresentation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to\nstudents, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to\nartifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from\nlarger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an\ninherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative\nsignals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided\nEnergy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses\nartifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled\nteacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided\nperturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the\nrefined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this\nperturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal\nstructural modification. Extensive experiments show that \\oursname consistently\nimproves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple\ndownstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.",

        "summary": "Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks\nto enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,\nclustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting\nthe flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering\ntask. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL\nlearners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we\nfirst randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an\ninstance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned\ninstance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we\ntrack the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract\nhigh-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to\nassign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the\npseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL\nlearner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the\nsuperior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep\nimage clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL\nmethods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can\nalso further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image\nclustering methods.",

        "summary": "The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial\nadvisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,\nmultimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER\n(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a\nmodular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting\nmodality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)\naligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP\nfor semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based\ntranscription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific\nfact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against\nthe human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns\nkeyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal\ncoherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a\ndataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos\nfor robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm\nFASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing\na new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory\ncontent more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for\nresearch.

        "summary": "While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on\nspecific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why\ncertain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian\nnoise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design\nrules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained\nvision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for\nimproved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input\nresolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather\nthan CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\\%p accuracy\ngains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,\nconverting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that\nlow-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically\nwith kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy\nroughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we\ndemonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion\nto the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that\ngrows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error\nand greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the\nvulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller\nnormalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case\nsensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing\ncommon in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into\ninterpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and\nbuild practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more\nrobust against Gaussian noise.",

Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the\ntraining data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate\ngeneralization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel\nmodel, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and\nGAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention\nmechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects\nwithin an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual\ncontext.

By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines\nvisual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.\nExtensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that\nour model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,\nparticularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting\nthe importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in\nadvancing VQA tasks.

        "summary": "Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which\nenforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the\nadversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual\nsharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation\nbetween their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as\nimage quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we\nconduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between\nperceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are\nnot necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment\nemerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while\ndiscriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their\nlearned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone\ninitializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further\ndemonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping\noptimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more\nfaithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.\nThese insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its\nconnection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled\napproaches to perceptual optimization.",

        "summary": "Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual\nQuestion Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as\nknowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions\nas visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the\ncaptions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and\nLLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning\ncapabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank\nAugmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to\nconvert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples\nfor the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to\nexclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to\nunderstand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the\nmodel's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end\ntraining. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently\non two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving\naccuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%.

        "summary": "Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as\ncrop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.\nVision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art\ntypically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.\nHowever, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each\nyear. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent\ncounting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,\nwe argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,\nfrom what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily\nobjects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with\ntime and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than\ncounting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and\nopen-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we\ninherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new\nextension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to\ncross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of\nTasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain\nvision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters\nused to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and\nPAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC\nmodels show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance\nbut also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a\nvision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant\ncounting.",

Nowadays, such\nambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent\nprogress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding\ninternational initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating\nthe visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany\ninstitutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant\nspecies still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the\ninstitutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available\nand spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image\nhosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge\npresented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy\ntraining dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling\nerrors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by\nexperts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was\ncreated from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that\ncollects millions of plant image queries all over the world.

Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,\nsuch as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating\nmeshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,\nwe view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to\nbuild simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we\ngeneralize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR\nmodel to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of\nlevel of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and\ngradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology\nis not predefined and is alterable.

However,\nconventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for\neach source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in\npractice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the\ntraining set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical\nand challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization\n(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training\ndata, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG\nmethods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of\ninaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel\ndual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.\nBuilding upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross\npseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level\nsupervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This\nfeature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision\ncaused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing\ncomplementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two\ndistinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to\nenhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model\ncollapse.

        "summary": "Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human\nphotos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face\ndegraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We\nintroduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity\ncustomization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that\nleverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain\nadditional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized\nmodels. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which\nidentifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to\nmanipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and\nreconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline\nalso enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of\npersonalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and\neliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to\naddress the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce\nResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a\npre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments\ndemonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity\nfidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our\nResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper\nacceptance.",

        "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image\ngeneration, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing\nimage editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with\npersonalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of\ngeometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D\nspace and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to\nmaintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the\nchallenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style\nconsistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack\nof realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without\nextensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose\n\\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object\ninsertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.\nBenefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert\nthe 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then\nre-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces\ngeometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as\ngeometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through\ndiffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,\nstyle-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.",

        "summary": "Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained\non disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially\naligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in\neach network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support\nit, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,\nand how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we\nsystematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in\nmid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from\nmodality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is\nrobust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered\n(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared\ncode is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a\nforced-choice \"Pick-a-Pic\" task shows that human preferences for image-caption\nmatches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model\npairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to\na single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic\ndistinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across\nexemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our\nresults demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code\nthat aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.",

To\naddress these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric\ngenerative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by\nleveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the\ngeneration perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned\ngenerative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key\ncomponent is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures\nboundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve\nvisual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose\nAttribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic\nsamples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we\nconstruct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for\ngenerative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in\nmaritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,\nparticularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code\nis available at https://github.com/gy65896/Neptune-X.",

We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method\nfor generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV\nmapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and\nartist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used\nto generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the\nparameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,\nalong with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an\nartist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves\ntopological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate\nArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile\nsolution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering\ntools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.",

Additionally,\nwe achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB\nimage, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry\ninherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same\nconditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both\nconvergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field\nestimation.

        "summary": "Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,\ngraphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their\nrelative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based\nsolely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the\nintrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal\nTransport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements\nusing their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that\npreserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group\nactions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with\nBispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT\non benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality\nof meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label\nstructure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class\nor content.",

        "summary": "Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions\nfrom simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused\non visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ\nto complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants\nto label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found\nthat human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the\nrepresentational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity\njudgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,\nlabels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that\nsemantic models provided complementary information to visual features in\nexplaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings\nextracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.\nThese results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the\nsemantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract\nrepresentations.",

We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,\nlanguage-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies\nviews to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry\nblockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision\nstrategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates\nperception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane\nHelene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall\nof 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a\nprecision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822.

We exploit this property by treating the reflection\nas an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a\nphysically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the\nvirtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a\nmulti-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,\nmaking it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for\ngeneralizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric\nsymmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine\npose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where\neach frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry\nrecovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable\nsynthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and\ncamera poses.

A\ncomputationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates\nthe problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These\ninpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control\nthe generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is\ndifficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some\ncases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve\nshirt with \"sleeves rolled up\" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt\nwith sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).\nInstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation\nmodels for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on\nuser-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies\nthe end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,\nand by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on\nscenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models\nalone.

        "summary": "Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the\ninput data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic\nconstraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware\nRule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal\nclustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly\ninto the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture\nby embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features\ninto a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule\nconsistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional\nclustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post\nhoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules\nare generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a\nloss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and\nviolation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets\ndemonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful\nand interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth\naircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering\nmetrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may\nhallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to\ncomplex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By\ncombining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more\nmeaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,\nhighlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for\ncomplex, knowledge intensive settings.",

Our\nmethodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing\npipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the\narea of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a\nUFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and\nanomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images\ndemonstrates $93.8\\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\\%$ accuracy on\ngood samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.\nThe system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality\ncontrol and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device\nimplementation.",

        "title": "Differential-Integral Neural Operator for Long-Term Turbulence Forecasting",
        "summary": "Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a\ngrand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging\nfrom climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,\nparticularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive\npredictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of\nphysical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously\ncapture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:\nlocal, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,\nwe propose the\n{\\textbf{\\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\\textbf{\\underline{I}}}ntegral\n{\\textbf{\\underline{N}}}eural {\\textbf{\\underline{O}}}perator (\\method{}), a\nnovel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator\ndecomposition. \\method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through\nparallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential\noperator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably\nconverges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a\nTransformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This\nphysics-based decomposition endows \\method{} with exceptional stability and\nrobustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow\nbenchmark, we demonstrate that \\method{} significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses\nerror accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both\nthe vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for\nphysically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.",

This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of\nperformance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a\nTime-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial\nenvironmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time\nstep, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future\nscene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head\n(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.\nFinally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct\nPreference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach\nprovides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more\nfine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in\nstandard DPO.

        "summary": "Approximately 10\\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at\nbirth, and around 5\\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)\nmonitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal\ncare, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely\nobstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying\nartificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous\nFHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into\npredicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent\nadvances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring\nwithout compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during\nmaternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead\nto signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing\ndata limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated\n(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as\nsimple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral\ncharacteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked\ntransformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by\ncapturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed\nmethod demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can\nbe used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be\napplied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of\nAI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be\nintegrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more\nrobust risk detection.",

To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first\nlarge-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.\nCaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A\ntasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps.

A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to\ngenerate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle\nLLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,\nand diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test\ncaptions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.\nBeyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting\ndeeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored\nevaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their\nstrengths and persistent limitations.

        "summary": "Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and\nhuman-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world\nscenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest\ndifferently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the\nPerson Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which\nintegrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn\nperson-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play\ncomponents operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the\nTemporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion\ncharacteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies\nWasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the\nfrequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness\nagainst person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion\nmechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant\nRegularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen\nperson-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing\nsubgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent\nsamples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the\nlarge-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing\nmethods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under\nfine-grained conditions.",

However, additional aspects crucial for\nthe computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still\noverlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance\nbeyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale\nevaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution\naccuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing\ncounterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that\nquantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident\npre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.\nIntriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other\nreliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these\nsame poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific\nquantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in\nzero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a\nstrict efficiency-performance trade-off.

This enables joint\nlearning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging\nunlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a\ndisentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This\napproach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion\nsegmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically\nplausible positions relative to the segmented layers.\n  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans\nand show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and\nlayer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer\nsegmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data.

In this work, we describe a new foundation model using the Prithvi-EO\nVision Transformer architecture which has been pre-trained to reconstruct data\nfrom the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). We evaluate the\nmodel by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first\nassess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify\nchlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote\nsensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate\nthe utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making\nuse of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed\nspatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations.

        "summary": "Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between\ninstances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer\nvision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric\nAmbiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable\nDiffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring\nextra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their\npixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold\npreservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and\nholistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D\ngeometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded\nfeatures and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these\nneeds. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally\ndesigned for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,\nmisaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the\nscarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach\nthat (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,\nfine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional\ncorrespondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under\ndata scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data\naugmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact\nmitigation.

        "summary": "The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a\ncritical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the\ndecision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches\nor misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained\nsignificant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance\ncompared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against\nadversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,\nparticularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI\nclassification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing\nrealistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.\nnon-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)\ntechnique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring\nnaturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of\nadversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification\nmodels. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary\nperson classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack\nsuccess rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%\n(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and\nfacebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%.

However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths\n(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited\nsupervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data\nheterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training\nefficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited\nsupervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a\npack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature\nsequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving\ndata heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes\ndiscarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with\ntailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature\nloss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to\ncompress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these\nchallenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while\nusing only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI).

        "summary": "Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in\ncomputer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use\nclassification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this\ntask is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene\nstructures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To\naddress these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been\nproposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the\nrecently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive\nfield and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and\neffectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning\ntends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which\nare essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.\nTo tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by\nthe Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning\nwithin shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's\nperception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two\nstages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,\nwhile its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader\ncontextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows\nenhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature\nintegration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and\nISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution\nfor semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.",

        "summary": "3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is\nessential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire\nmonitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be\nsolved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the\ncontext of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available\ncomputational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show\nthat the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple\ntarget scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a\ndrone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter\ncan be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and\nimage segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle\nfilter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new\ntasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be\nconducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image\nsegmentation model.",

Their performance has been driven by advances in frame\nsampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most\nrecently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified\nin earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains\nunexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box\npoisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID\ncompromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a\nclosed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal\nperturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction\nset constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow\nVideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini.

        "summary": "Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from\nthe teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing\nmethods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,\nleading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this\npaper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class\nproportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and\n(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks\ntarget. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free\nRobustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and\ndistribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a\nrobustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the\nless robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the\ndistribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness\ndistillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a\nuniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the\ndominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced\nrepresentation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target\nAdversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class\nconstraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack\ntargets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable\ncategories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD\nachieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack\n(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by\n15.1\\% and 6.4\\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior\nperformance in both robustness and fairness aspects.",

        "summary": "Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications\nlike disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of\ndistinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are\nhighly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A\nfundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the\ninherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute\ntargets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often\nleading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods\noften rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,\nwhich are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast\nand high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that\nexplicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic\nmodeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a\nBidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and\nGlobal Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature\ndependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer\narchitecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual\ninformation, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces\nthe Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded\nTaylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical\napproach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge\nlocalization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while\neffectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for\nprecise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural\nsemantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.",

While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme\nweather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather\noperability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an\nequivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm\npre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the\ngraph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature\nprocessing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse\nradar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the\nopen-source dataset and self-collected dataset show Equi-RO outperforms\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and robustness. Overall, our method\nachieves 10.7% and 20.0% relative improvements in translation and rotation\naccuracy, respectively, compared to the best baseline on the open-source\ndataset.",

        "summary": "Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection\nand mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for\nautomating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small\nsample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset\n(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest\n(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically\nreplaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free\nbounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate\nunder strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and\ntraining-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI\naugmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On\nMini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest\naverage ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to\nslightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI\nstrategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings\nwithout requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.",

Specifically, we\npropose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background\nsimilarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and\nthen refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.\nAs a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local\nclass similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of\nthe local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the\npatch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly\nselect numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring\nthe issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed\nMambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD\ndetection and near OOD detection setting.

Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these\nchallenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the\nreal-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical\nscenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model\nselection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of\nadvanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)\n(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,\nconsisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for\nblueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with\nsmartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled\ninstances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide\nrange of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the\nYOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while\nRT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR\nvariants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and\nthe mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To\nfurther enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using\nUnbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of\n1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in\n2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with\nRT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into\nSSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data.

        "summary": "Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based\npredictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively\nvisualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may\nfail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based\napproach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated\nexplanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is\nsufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information\ncarried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth\nexplanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to\nquantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.\nThe approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image\ndatasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently\noutperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational\nefficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.\nFurthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels\nare more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.",

        "title": "Sparse Representations Improve Adversarial Robustness of Neural Network Classifiers",
        "summary": "Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks\nbut remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work\nrevisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We\nempirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse\nvariant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and\nwe complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory\nside, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA\nfeatures: for both $\\ell_\\infty$ and $\\ell_2$ threat models (binary and\nmulticlass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\\top u$ shrink,\nwhere $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for\ngeneral (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a\nLipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.\nEmpirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA\nconsistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and\nblack-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,\nthe theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial\nleverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the\nlinear setting.

        "title": "Mammo-CLIP Dissect: A Framework for Analysing Mammography Concepts in Vision-Language Models",
        "summary": "Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe\ndeployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous\nwork has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been\npaid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect\nthe reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first\nconcept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision\nmodels trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific\nvision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a \"dissector,\" our approach labels\nneurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and\nquantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we\ninvestigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL\nvision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific\ndatasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept\nspecialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain\nunderrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more\nclinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'\nworkflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for\ntask-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories\n(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,\ndensity-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and\ngeneralisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights\ninto how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific\nknowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we\nreveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept\nlearning.
