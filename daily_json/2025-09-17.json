        "summary": "Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing\nones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video\ngaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in\ngenerating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D\nassets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose\nStyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D\nassets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous\nworks, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,\nenabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or\nboth styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a\nnovel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a\ndynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for\nstyle-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling\nstable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate\nsemantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature\nselection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of\n3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,\nallowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With\nSD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or\nboth-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we\nfurther propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables\nexclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style\nintensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor\noutperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.",

        "summary": "Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video\ngrounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,\nrequire \"temporally dense\" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal\nresolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is\ncomputationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this\npaper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for\ntemporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)\narchitecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy\nin videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our\narchitecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure\ntemporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction\nmodule that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally\nredundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.\nSecond, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the\nframe-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our\napproach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully\nsupervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost\n(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while\nclosely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.",

        "summary": "Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing\nto the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh\nenvironments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable\nadvances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they\nstill depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,\nand struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.\nRecent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have\nrelied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,\nattributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby\nlimiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we\nintroduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for\ninfrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs\nderived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,\nattributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level\nsemantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph\nrepresentation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation\nand structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and\ngeneralizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,\nsemantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.",

        "summary": "Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a\npre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,\nthere exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and\ngeneration distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the\nreconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering\nthe generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively\nanalyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from\nwhich, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both\nmain-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space\nconstruction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent\nperturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \\ie, the\nunexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a\nplug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the\nrobustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence\nspeed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \\ie, pFID, which successfully\ncorrelates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During\npost-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a\nwell-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between\ngenerated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\\sim$400M generator, a discrete\ntokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID\nand further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further\nexperiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our\npost-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,\ncoupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.",

Current FDA-cleared\nsystems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output\nmay limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective\noutput format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge\nthat is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI\nassistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and\nMessidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source\nmedical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI\nassistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration\nwhere GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at\nbaseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed\nnear-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions\nbased on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect\nones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o\nachieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even\nwithout direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs\nmay improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for\nstudying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations.

While VLA models have shown\nimpressive capability in executing real-world robotic tasks, their deployment\non resource-constrained platforms is often bottlenecked by the heavy\nattention-based computation over large sets of visual tokens. LightVLA\naddresses this challenge through adaptive, performance-driven pruning of visual\ntokens: It generates dynamic queries to evaluate visual token importance, and\nadopts Gumbel softmax to enable differentiable token selection. Through\nfine-tuning, LightVLA learns to preserve the most informative visual tokens\nwhile pruning tokens which do not contribute to task execution, thereby\nimproving efficiency and performance simultaneously. Notably, LightVLA requires\nno heuristic magic numbers and introduces no additional trainable parameters,\nmaking it compatible with modern inference frameworks. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that LightVLA outperforms different VLA models and existing token\npruning methods across diverse tasks on the LIBERO benchmark, achieving higher\nsuccess rates with substantially reduced computational overhead. Specifically,\nLightVLA reduces FLOPs and latency by 59.1% and 38.2% respectively, with a 2.9%\nimprovement in task success rate. Meanwhile, we also investigate the learnable\nquery-based token pruning method LightVLA* with additional trainable\nparameters, which also achieves satisfactory performance. Our work reveals that\nas VLA pursues optimal performance, LightVLA spontaneously learns to prune\ntokens from a performance-driven perspective.

Although\nexisting methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target\ntimesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic\nstrategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically\nfor different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits\nflexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion\nmodels in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper\nproposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various\nconsistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative\nstrategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different\nconsistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their\ncomputed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution\ntrajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on\nthe proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the\nsolution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of\nsmoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and\nhigh-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the\napplicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation\nscenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive\nsampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through\ncomprehensive experimental evaluations.

        "summary": "The increasing prevalence of retinal diseases poses a significant challenge\nto the healthcare system, as the demand for ophthalmologists surpasses the\navailable workforce. This imbalance creates a bottleneck in diagnosis and\ntreatment, potentially delaying critical care. Traditional methods of\ngenerating medical reports from retinal images rely on manual interpretation,\nwhich is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining\nophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal\nimages. AI can quickly analyze large volumes of image data, identifying subtle\npatterns essential for accurate diagnosis. By automating this process, AI\nsystems can greatly enhance the efficiency of retinal disease diagnosis,\nreducing doctors' workloads and enabling them to focus on more complex cases.\nThe proposed AI-based methods address key challenges in automated report\ngeneration: (1) A multi-modal deep learning approach captures interactions\nbetween textual keywords and retinal images, resulting in more comprehensive\nmedical reports; (2) Improved methods for medical keyword representation\nenhance the system's ability to capture nuances in medical terminology; (3)\nStrategies to overcome RNN-based models' limitations, particularly in capturing\nlong-range dependencies within medical descriptions; (4) Techniques to enhance\nthe interpretability of the AI-based report generation system, fostering trust\nand acceptance in clinical practice. These methods are rigorously evaluated\nusing various metrics and achieve state-of-the-art performance. This thesis\ndemonstrates AI's potential to revolutionize retinal disease diagnosis by\nautomating medical report generation, ultimately improving clinical efficiency,\ndiagnostic accuracy, and patient care.",

Despite their remarkable advancements,\ndiffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious\npurposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by\ndiffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are\nincluded in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\ndetection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,\nEnd4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree\nbetween the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus\nreconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it\nleverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local\nimage features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different\nscales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection\nperformance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark\ncomprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking\npatterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset\nwill be released soon.",

In\nthis work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion\nprediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile\nforegrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be\nassociated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel\nweakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or\npartially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To\nthis end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing\nforeground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion\nprediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground\nregions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to\nforeground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging\nnon-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly\nsupervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,\nand a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a\nRobust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame\ninformation and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in\nself-supervised learning.

        "title": "A Synthetic Data Pipeline for Supporting Manufacturing SMEs in Visual Assembly Control",
        "summary": "Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure\nnot only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration\ninto the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control\nusing computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs\nassociated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision\nalgorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive\ntraining, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers\nthe potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its\npractical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In\nthis work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient\nvisual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation\nbased on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The\nresults demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in\nmanufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)\nup to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear\nsystem components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when\ntransferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research\nhighlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable\npipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing\nresource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.",

        "summary": "In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the\namplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase\ncomponents. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs\npixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information\nand may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a\nU-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating\nmechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel\ndistribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and\nminimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This\nenables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with\nconventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss\nbased on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling\nbetter structural fidelity.

        "summary": "Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions\nbased on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two\nmodalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal\nmisalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes\ncontaining multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets\nare frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these\nchallenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature\nAlignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a\nhierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),\nKnowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the\nfirst stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),\nwhich facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and\ntextual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and\nefficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of\nlinguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature\nalignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies\nmultimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct\na unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range\ncross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.\nFinally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided\nSemantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation\nintroduced in earlier stages.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the\nreasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this\nsuccess, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to\nvision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.\nHowever, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as\nthe tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must\nfirst accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be\neffectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage\nreinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the\nperceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing\nadvantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform\ndataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using\ndistinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving\nthe model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual\nunderstanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning\nabilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we\nobtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual\nand reasoning capabilities.

However, this task remains fundamentally\nill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,\nmaking it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions\nduring generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction\npipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable\ntwo-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a\nlightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we\nintroduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information\ninto SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve\nfacial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution\nfacial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to\ngenerate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing\ntext-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design\na feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion\nmodule to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)\nfrom the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which\nutilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the\nreconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery.

        "summary": "While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated\nbenchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by\ntheir critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead\nof crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to\nthe fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model\n(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke\ndetectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\\%.\n  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing\ntext-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,\nMeta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related\nconcepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate\nthat this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy\nplummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,\nensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical\nconclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,\nthe raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the\n`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation\nrequires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,\nincluding pre-training.",

        "summary": "We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation\nnetworks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann\net al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting\nsignals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the\nnetwork's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral\nbottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero\noutput and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its\nrepresentational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight\nInitialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly\ninitialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are\nadaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to\nrandom Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without\nintroducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape\nfitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new\navenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep\nneural network training.

In this paper, we\npropose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing\nstrategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and\nDVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal\nscenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.\nThese objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's\nability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach\nenables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,\nand achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across\nmultiple datasets.

        "title": "Sy-FAR: Symmetry-based Fair Adversarial Robustness",
        "summary": "Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition\nsystems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world\nphysically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial\nrobustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair\nrobustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than\nfrom others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial\nrobustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has\nfocused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight\nis that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as\nface recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,\nleading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that\nseeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful\nas from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable\nbecause class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.\nAdditionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces\nsymmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions\nwhere group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to\nencourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively\nevaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including\nagainst targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR\nsignificantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across\nruns. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover\nin this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be\nclassified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.",

        "summary": "3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating\nautonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent\nself-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their\ncost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated\nbounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely\non frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately\nreconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak\ntemporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of\ndynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a\n4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for\ndynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted\nGaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial\ninformation to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,\ngenerating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a\nVelocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the\nreconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained\ndynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.\nEvaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.",

Motivated\nby the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual\ncapabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of\nCLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution\nacross layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with\nposition-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,\nthe model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous\nlayers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth\nattention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in\nthe early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of\ncompleted visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.\nExperiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a\nvariety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant\nimprovements in relation and attribute understanding.",

        "summary": "It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model\nperformance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due\nto the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our\nuse case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting\nthe musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as\ncolored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to\ndistinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which\nlarge language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive\ncapabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,\noffering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this\nwork, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual\ntraining data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a\nmapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions\nrepresenting muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,\nchain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000\nsynthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)\ndiagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our\nanalysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and\nseverity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We\nfurther generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to\ncreate a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this\nsynthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.\nThese results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which\nis particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While\nour methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques\ncan be adapted to other fields.",

        "summary": "Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale\ndata, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,\nmedical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,\nlimiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect\nperformance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual\npretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO\nrepresenting the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M\nchest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation\nprotocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines\nand tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.\nWhile prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,\nwe include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a\nmodel's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated\nstructures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for\nfinding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.\nSurprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured\nlabels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured\nsupervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k\nin-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.\nThese results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,\nenabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by\nutilizing in-domain data.",

        "summary": "While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies\ncontributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic\ncomplexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,\nparticularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents\na promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$\nto $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most\nexisting methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,\nwhich can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with\nthe query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,\ncontributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate\nthis limitation, we propose \\textbf{S}elective \\textbf{A}daptive\n\\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which\nintroduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information\naggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity\nand alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear\nattention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition\nmethod for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.\nExperiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\\times$ improvement in\nthroughput and a 2.69$\\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at\na resolution of $1280 \\times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up\nto 4.4\\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency\nand model effectiveness.",

Synthetic data\ngeneration presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current\nmethods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of\nanomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)\nthe presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and\ntheir corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism\nof the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel\ncross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize\nhigh-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly\naddressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by\na double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,\nconnection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism\nmitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features\nindependently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures\nstructural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff\noffers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant\nimprovements in downstream anomaly detection performance.",

        "summary": "Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique\nthat provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the\naccurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the\nhigh heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial\nchallenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to\neffectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases\ncommonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their\nperformance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way\nto combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor\nsubtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and\nsimplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase\nCECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware\nMamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to\nexplore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A\nsimilarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning\nmodeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious\ntemporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and\nmulti-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across\ndifferent scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic\ntumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases\nachieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between\npancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors\n(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.",

Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various\nchallenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and\nscene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a\nnear real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As\neach image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via\nOn-the-Fly SfM.

        "summary": "Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging\nproblem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality\nof images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make\nuse of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to\ngenerate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an\nimage--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,\ncompositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both\nLLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset\nof human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use\ninter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to\nunderstand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating\nthe same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image\nquality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality\nattributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for\neach axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect\nto all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic\nimage), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are\nmuch more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,\nthese findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal\nLLMs perceive images.",

        "summary": "This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8\n``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering\napproach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks\nbased on the ConvNeXt architecture.\n  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of\nweighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the\nlearned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned\nfilters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial\ndomain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are\nnon-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered\n``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial\nsmoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,\nand demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields\nshow good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.\n  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly\ndifferent values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each\nfilter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate\ndirections. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring\nspatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of\nthe receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or\n$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned\nfilters.\n  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of\nreceptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned\nfilters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing\nthat the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well\napproximated by discrete scale-space filters.",

Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal\nstructures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)\nEfficiency.

As\na result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and\ncross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language\nexperts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more\non parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and\nlinguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel\narchitecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.\nWe design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic\ninter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and\nevidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain\ncontextual grounding.

While existing benchmarks\ndemonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that\npoorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically\nmaintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets\nartificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable\nanomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of\nsemantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically\npaired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins\nwith constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)\ndataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art\nimage manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible\ntextual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this\nfoundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and\nGrounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge\nrepositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary\ntexts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding\nand deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing\nmethods, achieving 2.06\\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

        "title": "CIARD: Cyclic Iterative Adversarial Robustness Distillation",
        "summary": "Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance\nand robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling\nresilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD\napproaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads\nto the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this\nproblem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The\ndivergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and\nrobust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and\n2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to\nperformance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key\ninnovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment\nto resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous\nadversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against\nperformance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive\nexperiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD\nachieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial\ndefense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean\nsample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness\nand generalization.

        "summary": "Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in\ncomputer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to\nrestore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in run-ning\nspeed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel\nframework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes\ntwo modules: feature extraction and lighting estima-tion. First, we take\nadvantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather\nthan con-tinuous features to avoid \"posterior collapse\". Second, we capture\nglobal context and dependencies of in-put image through ViT rather than CNNs to\nimprove the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the\nabove two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass\nclassification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our\nmodel predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping\nlightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and\nim-proves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to\nexisting state-of-the-art methods.",

While existing methods struggle\nwith precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most\ndiscriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation\nMapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence\nfunctions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our\nmethod introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that\nuses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete\nobject coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function\nIntegration that captures the relationship between training samples and model\npredictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)\nMulti-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies\nto achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before\npost-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional\nRandom Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS\nmethods.

Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution\nof each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images\nshowcase the method's robustness and generalization capability.

        "summary": "Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the\ninherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene\nunderstanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.\nWhile recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model\ndistillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages\nsemantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose\na paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for\nsemantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level\nGaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,\ncreating comprehensive \"bags of embeddings\" that holistically describe objects.\nThis allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text\nqueries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task\nadaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to\nGaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method\neffectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction\nwhile remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D\nopen-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.",

        "summary": "Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on\nresource-constrained devices requires significant compression without\ncom-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage\ncompression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating\nsparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge\nDistillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity\nduring model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and\ndetection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging\nbatch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,\nsignificantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to\nmitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer\nknowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss\nweighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive\nexperiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model\nparameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to\n13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The\nresulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from\n26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge\ndevices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While\nthis introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly\nimproves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of\nour approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.",

One-stage detectors from\nthe YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and\nclassification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial\nbenchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how\nsuccessive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly\navailable datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease\nset (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20\nclasses). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,\n100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions\nfixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical\nhyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate\nprecision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and\nframes-per-second (FPS).

To overcome this challenge, we\nintroduce a novel system architecture that enables fully autonomous,\nhigh-fidelity 3D scanning of static objects using UAVs weighing under 100\ngrams. Our core innovation lies in a dual-reconstruction pipeline that creates\na real-time feedback loop between data capture and flight control. A\nnear-real-time (near-RT) process uses Structure from Motion (SfM) to generate\nan instantaneous pointcloud of the object. The system analyzes the model\nquality on the fly and dynamically adapts the UAV's trajectory to intelligently\ncapture new images of poorly covered areas. This ensures comprehensive data\nacquisition. For the final, detailed output, a non-real-time (non-RT) pipeline\nemploys a Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR)\napproach, fusing SfM-derived camera poses with precise Ultra Wide-Band (UWB)\nlocation data to achieve superior accuracy. We implemented and validated this\narchitecture using Crazyflie 2.1 UAVs. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsingle- and multi-UAV configurations, conclusively show that dynamic trajectory\nadaptation consistently improves reconstruction quality over static flight\npaths. This work demonstrates a scalable and autonomous solution that unlocks\nthe potential of miniaturized UAVs for fine-grained 3D reconstruction in\nconstrained environments, a capability previously limited to much larger\nplatforms.",

Accurate recognition\nof cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield\nestimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight\nreal-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex\nfield conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial\nrepresentation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while\nintroducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to\nbetter capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field\nSPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling\nat low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and\nrelease an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future\nresearch.

        "summary": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across\nhundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing\napplications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and\nenvironmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the\nslow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient\nmodels are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission\nof redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we\nintroduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)\nframework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL\nintegrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw\npuzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively\nincreases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to\njointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global\nsemantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously\naddresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally\nefficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models\nfor onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation\ntasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some\nstate-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in\ngeneralizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for\nreal-world HSI applications.

        "summary": "4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point\nclouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a\nfoundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often\nsuffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,\nresulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it\ndifficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we\npropose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers\ndense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction\nquality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs\nreconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the\nstudent's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we\npropose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one\ndistilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and\nrefines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a\nnoise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a\npredefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive\nexperiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves\nboth high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D\nradar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on\ndownstream tasks.

Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge\nusing unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing\nsemi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and\ninsufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,\nthis paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation\nframework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a\nCross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and\nentropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design\na dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using\nan uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In\naddition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align\nuncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively\ndifferentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing\nprediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D\nsegmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019.

RadGame addresses this gap\nby combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,\nAI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.\nIn RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which\nare automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public\ndatasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for\nuser missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest\nX-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on\nradiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared\nto a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing\na final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants\nusing RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to\n17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing\naccuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.\nRadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,\nfeedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI\nresources in education.",

        "summary": "As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots\nhas become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection\nusing surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the\nparking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and\nthe scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,\nocclusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and\nomissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly\nincreasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these\nissues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named\nCRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather\nconditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing\ndatasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a\nhigher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking\nslots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot\ndetection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting\nunlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in\nparking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with\nconfidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.\nExperimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing\ndataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant\nthe gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and\nthe dataset have been made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/zzh362/CRPS-D.",

While StarCraft II-related environments have driven\nsignificant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on\nmicromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic\nintelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL\nbenchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical\nstratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a\nspecific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic\nelements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,\nthereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making\ncapabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond\nconventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,\nto assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We\nintegrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our\nbenchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments.

        "summary": "Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,\ndynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing\ntrackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,\nresulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.\nFurthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by\nthe linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against\ncomplex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends\nthe SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach\nincorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,\nstrengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.\nThese enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve\nperformance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the\nadded temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed\non the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1\nFPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without\nnotable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:\ncompared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and\nprecision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal\nmodeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and\nefficient solution for aerial object tracking.

While existing\nprototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two\ncritical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited\nrepresentational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)\nInter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are\nmisaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative\ncapability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional\nencoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the\nprototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the\nPrototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity\nprototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream\nlearner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic\nLearner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel\nDiffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting\ndual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),\nwhich adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively\nalign the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration\nMechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent\nsemantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets\ndemonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross various few-shot settings.",

        "summary": "Visual-inertial fusion is crucial for a large amount of intelligent and\nautonomous applications, such as robot navigation and augmented reality. To\nbootstrap and achieve optimal state estimation, the spatial-temporal\ndisplacements between IMU and cameras must be calibrated in advance. Most\nexisting calibration methods adopt continuous-time state representation, more\nspecifically the B-spline. Despite these methods achieve precise\nspatial-temporal calibration, they suffer from high computational cost caused\nby continuous-time state representation. To this end, we propose a novel and\nextremely efficient calibration method that unleashes the power of\ndiscrete-time state representation. Moreover, the weakness of discrete-time\nstate representation in temporal calibration is tackled in this paper. With the\nincreasing production of drones, cellphones and other visual-inertial\nplatforms, if one million devices need calibration around the world, saving one\nminute for the calibration of each device means saving 2083 work days in total.\nTo benefit both the research and industry communities, our code will be\nopen-source.",

While recent two-stage\napproaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to\nincomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized\nRepresentation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided\nreasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex\ninteractions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding\nit beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships\ninvolving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the\nfunctional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet\nstructures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify\ntool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable\nprompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with\ncontextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns\nlanguage with image content at both global and regional levels. These\ncontextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues\nfor more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions.

MEGAN's gating\nnetwork optimally combines predictions and uncertainties from each EDL model,\nenhancing overall prediction confidence and calibration. We extensively\nbenchmark MEGAN on endoscopy videos for Ulcerative colitis (UC) disease\nseverity estimation, assessed by visual labeling of Mayo Endoscopic Subscore\n(MES), where inter-rater variability is prevalent. In large-scale prospective\nUC clinical trial, MEGAN achieved a 3.5% improvement in F1-score and a 30.5%\nreduction in Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to existing methods.\nFurthermore, MEGAN facilitated uncertainty-guided sample stratification,\nreducing the annotation burden and potentially increasing efficiency and\nconsistency in UC trials.",

However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by\nchallenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited\ntraining data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often\ndepend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit\nthe effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.\nTo address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for\nFew-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively\nimproves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for\nfew-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling\n(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level\nrepresentations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis\nfor subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates\na Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to\ncapture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize\ndependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance\nintra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough\ntoken refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic\nconsistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation\nPenalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that\nBATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and\nimproves the few-shot classification via transformers.",

In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object\ngeo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent\nlocalization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode\ntask-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and\niteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.\nTo enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:\n(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation\npriors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic\nguidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature\nEnhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize\nobject-relevant regions in the reference features.

        "summary": "The Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task requires an agent to follow\nnatural language instructions and navigate through complex environments.\nExisting MLLM-based VLN methods primarily rely on imitation learning (IL) and\noften use DAgger for post-training to mitigate covariate shift. While\neffective, these approaches incur substantial data collection and training\ncosts. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. However,\nprior VLN RL methods lack dynamic interaction with the environment and depend\non expert trajectories for reward shaping, rather than engaging in open-ended\nactive exploration. This restricts the agent's ability to discover diverse and\nplausible navigation routes. To address these limitations, we propose\nActiveVLN, a VLN framework that explicitly enables active exploration through\nmulti-turn RL. In the first stage, a small fraction of expert trajectories is\nused for IL to bootstrap the agent. In the second stage, the agent iteratively\npredicts and executes actions, automatically collects diverse trajectories, and\noptimizes multiple rollouts via the GRPO objective. To further improve RL\nefficiency, we introduce a dynamic early-stopping strategy to prune long-tail\nor likely failed trajectories, along with additional engineering optimizations.\nExperiments show that ActiveVLN achieves the largest performance gains over IL\nbaselines compared to both DAgger-based and prior RL-based post-training\nmethods, while reaching competitive performance with state-of-the-art\napproaches despite using a smaller model.

Even this poses a serious security\nchallenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little\nexploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied\nto 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework\ncalled DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By\nreverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),\nadversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,\nthereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on\nthree state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and\nGeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that\nremoving regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their\nregistration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware\nautonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces\nnoticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical\nworld by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,\nthereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This\nstep has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that\ndemonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.",

        "title": "Neural Collapse-Inspired Multi-Label Federated Learning under Label-Distribution Skew",
        "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across\ndistributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of\ndeep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous\ndata. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data\nexhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label\ndependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.\nWhile most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label\nclassification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as\nmedical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address\nthis important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label\ndata with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a\ngeometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class\ncollapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class\nmeans form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we\npropose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn\nhigh-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure\napplicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain\nmultiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that\nextracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled\nclass-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which\nmitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data\ndistributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage\ncompact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four\nbenchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging\nFL scenario.",

        "summary": "Anomaly detection and classification in medical imaging are critical for\nearly diagnosis but remain challenging due to limited annotated data, class\nimbalance, and the high cost of expert labeling. Emerging vision foundation\nmodels such as DINOv2, pretrained on extensive, unlabeled datasets, offer\ngeneralized representations that can potentially alleviate these limitations.\nIn this study, we propose an attention-based global aggregation framework\ntailored specifically for 3D medical image anomaly classification. Leveraging\nthe self-supervised DINOv2 model as a pretrained feature extractor, our method\nprocesses individual 2D axial slices of brain MRIs, assigning adaptive\nslice-level importance weights through a soft attention mechanism. To further\naddress data scarcity, we employ a composite loss function combining supervised\ncontrastive learning with class-variance regularization, enhancing inter-class\nseparability and intra-class consistency. We validate our framework on the ADNI\ndataset and an institutional multi-class headache cohort, demonstrating strong\nanomaly classification performance despite limited data availability and\nsignificant class imbalance.

However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,\nespecially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in\nautomotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed\nlearning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational\nmodels or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners\nhave largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small\ndatasets.\n  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar\ndataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D\nsingle-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation\nwith quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution\nsensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)\ngeneralizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and\nshows logarithmic data scaling of 20\\% per $10\\times$ data. We also run\nextensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar\ndata significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to\na $10\\times$ increase in training data.

Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often\nemploy end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma\ndatasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling\nFramework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis.

Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites\nprovide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a\nspatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep\nlearning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution\nover the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier\nAir-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured\nby clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual\ntemperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature\nvalues at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal\nvariations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface\ntemperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key\nEarth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive\nuncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.\nThe proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature\npixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the\ncontiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping\naccuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation.

        "summary": "Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,\ntarget, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding\nchallenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task\nlearning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown\npromising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)\ninter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and\ntask-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to\nclass-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the\nMLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and\nintra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task\noptimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning\nscheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific\ncomponents. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal\nLarge Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically\naugment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,\ncomprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering\nthe temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.\nTo tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient\nLearning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative\ngradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning\nbehaviors.

All existing methods treat validation as a\nclassification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this\nwork, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more\nfine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend\npreviously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction\nand attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration\nerror estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with\nheterogeneous spatial densities.

        "summary": "Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective\nmedium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary\nchallenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components\nin the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing\nand recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address\nreflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property\nvariations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively\ndiscern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral\nlearning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum\nof the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by\nperceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the\nspectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior\nrefinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and\nadaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.\nFurthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the\ntransmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on\nthree different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and\ngeneralization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.",

To\naddress this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse\nsynthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.\nMechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part\ndynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.\nBuilding on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that\npredicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point\nclouds.

Our key finding is that the effectiveness of\npost-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and\ndomain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose\nmodel (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A\nK-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known\nindividuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head\nimproved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13\npoints, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on\naveraged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is\nmore difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant\nvalidation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the\ncritical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,\nlimited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific\npre-training.
