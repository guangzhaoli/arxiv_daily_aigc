        "summary": "With the growing demands of AI-generated content (AIGC), the need for\nhigh-quality, diverse, and scalable data has become increasingly crucial.\nHowever, collecting large-scale real-world data remains costly and\ntime-consuming, hindering the development of downstream applications. While\nsome works attempt to collect task-specific data via a rendering process, most\napproaches still rely on manual scene construction, limiting their scalability\nand accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Follow-Your-Instruction,\na Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven framework for automatically\nsynthesizing high-quality 2D, 3D, and 4D data. Our\n\\textbf{Follow-Your-Instruction} first collects assets and their associated\ndescriptions through multimodal inputs using the MLLM-Collector. Then it\nconstructs 3D layouts, and leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for semantic\nrefinement through multi-view scenes with the MLLM-Generator and\nMLLM-Optimizer, respectively. Finally, it uses MLLM-Planner to generate\ntemporally coherent future frames. We evaluate the quality of the generated\ndata through comprehensive experiments on the 2D, 3D, and 4D generative tasks.\nThe results show that our synthetic data significantly boosts the performance\nof existing baseline models, demonstrating Follow-Your-Instruction's potential\nas a scalable and effective data engine for generative intelligence.",

        "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential\nsubtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

        "summary": "Despite rapid advances in 3D content generation, quality assessment for the\ngenerated 3D assets remains challenging. Existing methods mainly rely on\nimage-based metrics and operate solely at the object level, limiting their\nability to capture spatial coherence, material authenticity, and high-fidelity\nlocal details. 1) To address these challenges, we introduce Hi3DEval, a\nhierarchical evaluation framework tailored for 3D generative content. It\ncombines both object-level and part-level evaluation, enabling holistic\nassessments across multiple dimensions as well as fine-grained quality\nanalysis. Additionally, we extend texture evaluation beyond aesthetic\nappearance by explicitly assessing material realism, focusing on attributes\nsuch as albedo, saturation, and metallicness. 2) To support this framework, we\nconstruct Hi3DBench, a large-scale dataset comprising diverse 3D assets and\nhigh-quality annotations, accompanied by a reliable multi-agent annotation\npipeline. We further propose a 3D-aware automated scoring system based on\nhybrid 3D representations. Specifically, we leverage video-based\nrepresentations for object-level and material-subject evaluations to enhance\nmodeling of spatio-temporal consistency and employ pretrained 3D features for\npart-level perception.

A critical yet\nunderexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific\nprior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)\nand the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for\ndiagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single\nimages, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture\ndiagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose\nPriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates\nreal-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we\nintroduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages\nclinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model\nto align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology\nreports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for\nreport generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior\nknowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states. This decoding allows the\nmodel to align with diagnostic focus and track disease progression, thereby\nenhancing the clinical accuracy and fluency of the generated reports. Extensive\nexperiments on MIMIC-CXR and MIMIC-ABN datasets demonstrate that PriorRG\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 3.6% BLEU-4 and 3.8% F1 score\nimprovement on MIMIC-CXR, and a 5.9% BLEU-1 gain on MIMIC-ABN.

Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose a novel multimodal knowledge-augmented generation framework\n(mKG-RAG) based on multimodal KGs for knowledge-intensive VQA tasks.\nSpecifically, our approach leverages MLLM-powered keyword extraction and\nvision-text matching to distill semantically consistent and modality-aligned\nentities/relationships from multimodal documents, constructing high-quality\nmultimodal KGs as structured knowledge representations.

        "summary": "Infrared and visible image fusion (IVIF) aims to combine the thermal\nradiation information from infrared images with the rich texture details from\nvisible images to enhance perceptual capabilities for downstream visual tasks.\nHowever, existing methods often fail to preserve key targets due to a lack of\ndeep semantic understanding of the scene, while the fusion process itself can\nalso introduce artifacts and detail loss, severely compromising both image\nquality and task performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes\nSGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core\nof our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as\nexplicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a\nconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a\ntwo-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal\nfeatures, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the\npreliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's\ncoarse-to-fine denoising generation. This ensures the fusion process not only\nhas explicit semantic directionality but also guarantees the high fidelity of\nthe final result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SGDFuse achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in both subjective and objective evaluations, as\nwell as in its adaptability to downstream tasks, providing a powerful solution\nto the core challenges in image fusion.

        "summary": "Arbitrary viewpoint image generation holds significant potential for\nautonomous driving, yet remains a challenging task due to the lack of\nground-truth data for extrapolated views, which hampers the training of\nhigh-fidelity generative models. In this work, we propose Arbiviewgen, a novel\ndiffusion-based framework for the generation of controllable camera images from\narbitrary points of view. To address the absence of ground-truth data in unseen\nviews, we introduce two key components: Feature-Aware Adaptive View Stitching\n(FAVS) and Cross-View Consistency Self-Supervised Learning (CVC-SSL). FAVS\nemploys a hierarchical matching strategy that first establishes coarse\ngeometric correspondences using camera poses, then performs fine-grained\nalignment through improved feature matching algorithms, and identifies\nhigh-confidence matching regions via clustering analysis. Building upon this,\nCVC-SSL adopts a self-supervised training paradigm where the model reconstructs\nthe original camera views from the synthesized stitched images using a\ndiffusion model, enforcing cross-view consistency without requiring supervision\nfrom extrapolated data. Our framework requires only multi-camera images and\ntheir associated poses for training, eliminating the need for additional\nsensors or depth maps.

However, the\nexisting tokenizers often face unsatisfactory trade-off between compression\nratios and reconstruction fidelity. To fill this gap, we introduce a powerful\nand concise WeTok tokenizer, which surpasses the previous leading tokenizers\nvia two core innovations. (1) Group-wise lookup-free Quantization (GQ). We\npartition the latent features into groups, and perform lookup-free quantization\nfor each group. As a result, GQ can efficiently overcome memory and computation\nlimitations of prior tokenizers, while achieving a reconstruction breakthrough\nwith more scalable codebooks. (2) Generative Decoding (GD). Different from\nprior tokenizers, we introduce a generative decoder with a prior of extra noise\nvariable. In this case, GD can probabilistically model the distribution of\nvisual data conditioned on discrete tokens, allowing WeTok to reconstruct\nvisual details, especially at high compression ratios. Extensive experiments on\nmainstream benchmarks show superior performance of our WeTok. On the ImageNet\n50k validation set, WeTok achieves a record-low zero-shot rFID (WeTok: 0.12 vs.\nFLUX-VAE: 0.18 vs. SD-VAE 3.5: 0.19).

        "summary": "Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics,\nsurgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation\nmodels are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision\nmaking across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in\nimage characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of\ngeneralizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial.\nThis model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for\nmodality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major\nchallenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT\nvs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these\nissues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables\nmultimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method\nintegrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module\nthat harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local\ntraining. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset\nand a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was\ninitially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its\nperformance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT\ndata were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data\nscenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test\ncases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines.\nIn the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized\nperformance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a\n10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong\ncross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.",

A critical\nconcern for these models is the preservation of an image's underlying Scene\nComposition Structure (SCS), which defines the geometric relationships among\nobjects and the background, their relative positions, sizes, orientations, etc.\nMaintaining SCS integrity is paramount for ensuring faithful and structurally\naccurate GenAI outputs. Traditional image similarity metrics often fall short\nin assessing SCS. Pixel-level approaches are overly sensitive to minor visual\nnoise, while perception-based metrics prioritize human aesthetic appeal,\nneither adequately capturing structural fidelity. Furthermore, recent\nneural-network-based metrics introduce training overheads and potential\ngeneralization issues. We introduce the SCS Similarity Index Measure (SCSSIM),\na novel, analytical, and training-free metric that quantifies SCS preservation\nby exploiting statistical measures derived from the Cuboidal hierarchical\npartitioning of images, robustly capturing non-object-based structural\nrelationships. Our experiments demonstrate SCSSIM's high invariance to\nnon-compositional distortions, accurately reflecting unchanged SCS. Conversely,\nit shows a strong monotonic decrease for compositional distortions, precisely\nindicating when SCS has been altered. Compared to existing metrics, SCSSIM\nexhibits superior properties for structural evaluation, making it an invaluable\ntool for developing and evaluating generative models, ensuring the integrity of\nscene composition.",

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive\nperformance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and\nYouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated\nobjects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS\ntoward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1)\nwas introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the\nstrengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more\nchallenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world\nconditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks\nfor 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2\nintroduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent\nobject disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller\nobjects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g.,\nrain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot\nsequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows,\nreflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20\nrepresentative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent\nperformance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9%\non MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar\ndeclines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These\nresults highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS\nmethods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly\navailable at https://MOSE.video.",

We achieve\nthis by combining the physical accuracy of traditional rendering with the\nphotorealistic appearance made possible by neural rendering. Our pipeline works\nby inferring a colored mesh representation of a given scene using monocular\nestimates of geometry and intrinsic components. This representation allows\nusers to define their desired illumination configuration in 3D. The scene under\nthe new lighting can then be rendered using a path-tracing engine. We send this\napproximate rendering of the scene through a feed-forward neural renderer to\npredict the final photorealistic relighting result. We develop a differentiable\nrendering process to reconstruct in-the-wild scene illumination, enabling\nself-supervised training of our neural renderer on raw image collections.

        "summary": "Multimodal generative AI usually involves generating image or text responses\ngiven inputs in another modality. The evaluation of image-text relevancy is\nessential for measuring response quality or ranking candidate responses. In\nparticular, binary relevancy evaluation, i.e., ``Relevant'' vs. ``Not\nRelevant'', is a fundamental problem. However, this is a challenging task\nconsidering that texts have diverse formats and the definition of relevancy\nvaries in different scenarios.

To overcome this, we present MagicHOI, a method for\nreconstructing hands and objects from short monocular interaction videos, even\nunder limited viewpoint variation. Our key insight is that, despite the\nscarcity of paired 3D hand-object data, large-scale novel view synthesis\ndiffusion models offer rich object supervision. This supervision serves as a\nprior to regularize unseen object regions during hand interactions. Leveraging\nthis insight, we integrate a novel view synthesis model into our hand-object\nreconstruction framework. We further align hand to object by incorporating\nvisible contact constraints. Our results demonstrate that MagicHOI\nsignificantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art hand-object reconstruction\nmethods.

        "summary": "Previous work has suggested that preprocessing images through lossy\ncompression can defend against adversarial perturbations, but comprehensive\nattack evaluations have been lacking. In this paper, we construct strong\nwhite-box and adaptive attacks against various compression models and identify\na critical challenge for attackers: high realism in reconstructed images\nsignificantly increases attack difficulty. Through rigorous evaluation across\nmultiple attack scenarios, we demonstrate that compression models capable of\nproducing realistic, high-fidelity reconstructions are substantially more\nresistant to our attacks. In contrast, low-realism compression models can be\nbroken. Our analysis reveals that this is not due to gradient masking. Rather,\nrealistic reconstructions maintaining distributional alignment with natural\nimages seem to offer inherent robustness. This work highlights a significant\nobstacle for future adversarial attacks and suggests that developing more\neffective techniques to overcome realism represents an essential challenge for\ncomprehensive security evaluation.",

        "summary": "Slot Attention (SA) and its variants lie at the heart of mainstream\nObject-Centric Learning (OCL). Objects in an image can be aggregated into\nrespective slot vectors, by \\textit{iteratively} refining cold-start query\nvectors, typically three times, via SA on image features. For video, such\naggregation is \\textit{recurrently} shared across frames, with queries\ncold-started on the first frame while transitioned from the previous frame's\nslots on non-first frames. However, the cold-start queries lack sample-specific\ncues thus hinder precise aggregation on the image or video's first frame; Also,\nnon-first frames' queries are already sample-specific thus require transforms\ndifferent from the first frame's aggregation. We address these issues for the\nfirst time with our \\textit{SmoothSA}: (1) To smooth SA iterations on the image\nor video's first frame, we \\textit{preheat} the cold-start queries with rich\ninformation of input features, via a tiny module self-distilled inside OCL; (2)\nTo smooth SA recurrences across all video frames, we \\textit{differentiate} the\nhomogeneous transforms on the first and non-first frames, by using full and\nsingle iterations respectively. Comprehensive experiments on object discovery,\nrecognition and downstream benchmarks validate our method's effectiveness.\nFurther analyses intuitively illuminate how our method smooths SA iterations\nand recurrences.

However, 3DGS\nresorts to the Gaussian function that is low-pass by nature and is restricted\nin representing high-frequency details in 3D scenes. Moreover, it causes\nredundant primitives with degraded training and rendering efficiency and\nexcessive memory overhead. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Gabor\nSplatting (3DGabSplat) that leverages a novel 3D Gabor-based primitive with\nmultiple directional 3D frequency responses for radiance field representation\nsupervised by multi-view images. The proposed 3D Gabor-based primitive forms a\nfilter bank incorporating multiple 3D Gabor kernels at different frequencies to\nenhance flexibility and efficiency in capturing fine 3D details. Furthermore,\nto achieve novel view rendering, an efficient CUDA-based rasterizer is\ndeveloped to project the multiple directional 3D frequency components\ncharacterized by 3D Gabor-based primitives onto the 2D image plane, and a\nfrequency-adaptive mechanism is presented for adaptive joint optimization of\nprimitives. 3DGabSplat is scalable to be a plug-and-play kernel for seamless\nintegration into existing 3DGS paradigms to enhance both efficiency and quality\nof novel view synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 3DGabSplat\noutperforms 3DGS and its variants using alternative primitives, and achieves\nstate-of-the-art rendering quality across both real-world and synthetic scenes.\nRemarkably, we achieve up to 1.35 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS with simultaneously\nreduced number of primitives and memory consumption.",

        "summary": "Medical image understanding plays a crucial role in enabling automated\ndiagnosis and data-driven clinical decision support. However, its progress is\nimpeded by two primary challenges: the limited availability of high-quality\nannotated medical data and an overreliance on global image features, which\noften miss subtle but clinically significant pathological regions. To address\nthese issues, we introduce RegionMed-CLIP, a region-aware multimodal\ncontrastive learning framework that explicitly incorporates localized\npathological signals along with holistic semantic representations. The core of\nour method is an innovative region-of-interest (ROI) processor that adaptively\nintegrates fine-grained regional features with the global context, supported by\na progressive training strategy that enhances hierarchical multimodal\nalignment. To enable large-scale region-level representation learning, we\nconstruct MedRegion-500k, a comprehensive medical image-text corpus that\nfeatures extensive regional annotations and multilevel clinical descriptions.\nExtensive experiments on image-text retrieval, zero-shot classification, and\nvisual question answering tasks demonstrate that RegionMed-CLIP consistently\nexceeds state-of-the-art vision language models by a wide margin. Our results\nhighlight the critical importance of region-aware contrastive pre-training and\nposition RegionMed-CLIP as a robust foundation for advancing multimodal medical\nimage understanding.",

        "summary": "Vision-language tracking has received increasing attention in recent years,\nas textual information can effectively address the inflexibility and inaccuracy\nassociated with specifying the target object to be tracked. Existing works\neither directly fuse the fixed language with vision features or simply modify\nusing attention, however, their performance is still limited. Recently, some\nresearchers have explored using text generation to adapt to the variations in\nthe target during tracking, however, these works fail to provide insights into\nthe model's reasoning process and do not fully leverage the advantages of large\nmodels, which further limits their overall performance. To address the\naforementioned issues, this paper proposes a novel reasoning-based\nvision-language tracking framework, named ReasoningTrack, based on a\npre-trained vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL. Both SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning)\nand reinforcement learning GRPO are used for the optimization of reasoning and\nlanguage generation. We embed the updated language descriptions and feed them\ninto a unified tracking backbone network together with vision features. Then,\nwe adopt a tracking head to predict the specific location of the target object.\nIn addition, we propose a large-scale long-term vision-language tracking\nbenchmark dataset, termed TNLLT, which contains 200 video sequences. 20\nbaseline visual trackers are re-trained and evaluated on this dataset, which\nbuilds a solid foundation for the vision-language visual tracking task.\nExtensive experiments on multiple vision-language tracking benchmark datasets\nfully validated the effectiveness of our proposed reasoning-based natural\nlanguage generation strategy.

        "summary": "Few-Shot Segmentation(FSS) aims to efficient segmentation of new objects with\nfew labeled samples. However, its performance significantly degrades when\ndomain discrepancies exist between training and deployment. Cross-Domain\nFew-Shot Segmentation(CD-FSS) is proposed to mitigate such performance\ndegradation. Current CD-FSS methods primarily sought to develop segmentation\nmodels on a source domain capable of cross-domain generalization. However,\ndriven by escalating concerns over data privacy and the imperative to minimize\ndata transfer and training expenses, the development of source-free CD-FSS\napproaches has become essential. In this work, we propose a source-free CD-FSS\nmethod that leverages both textual and visual information to facilitate target\ndomain task adaptation without requiring source domain data. Specifically, we\nfirst append Task-Specific Attention Adapters (TSAA) to the feature pyramid of\na pretrained backbone, which adapt multi-level features extracted from the\nshared pre-trained backbone to the target task. Then, the parameters of the\nTSAA are trained through a Visual-Visual Embedding Alignment (VVEA) module and\na Text-Visual Embedding Alignment (TVEA) module. The VVEA module utilizes\nglobal-local visual features to align image features across different views,\nwhile the TVEA module leverages textual priors from pre-aligned multi-modal\nfeatures (e.g., from CLIP) to guide cross-modal adaptation. By combining the\noutputs of these modules through dense comparison operations and subsequent\nfusion via skip connections, our method produces refined prediction masks.\nUnder both 1-shot and 5-shot settings, the proposed approach achieves average\nsegmentation accuracy improvements of 2.18\\% and 4.11\\%, respectively, across\nfour cross-domain datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CD-FSS\nmethods.

        "summary": "Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) excel in visual-language tasks by leveraging\nnumerous visual tokens for fine-grained visual information, but this token\nredundancy results in significant computational costs. Previous research aimed\nat reducing visual tokens during inference typically leverages importance maps\nderived from attention scores among vision-only tokens or vision-language\ntokens to prune tokens across one or multiple pruning stages. Despite this\nprogress, pruning frameworks and strategies remain simplistic and\ninsufficiently explored, often resulting in substantial performance\ndegradation. In this paper, we propose VFlowOpt, a token pruning framework that\nintroduces an importance map derivation process and a progressive pruning\nmodule with a recycling mechanism. The hyperparameters of its pruning strategy\nare further optimized by a visual information flow-guided method. Specifically,\nwe compute an importance map for image tokens based on their attention-derived\ncontext relevance and patch-level information entropy. We then decide which\ntokens to retain or prune and aggregate the pruned ones as recycled tokens to\navoid potential information loss. Finally, we apply a visual information\nflow-guided method that regards the last token in the LMM as the most\nrepresentative signal of text-visual interactions. This method minimizes the\ndiscrepancy between token representations in LMMs with and without pruning,\nthereby enabling superior pruning strategies tailored to different LMMs.\nExperiments demonstrate that VFlowOpt can prune 90% of visual tokens while\nmaintaining comparable performance, leading to an 89% reduction in KV-Cache\nmemory and 3.8 times faster inference.",

        "summary": "Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic\nmanipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,\nwhich limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and\ngeneralization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a\nframework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view\nplanning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient\nexploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively\nacquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nvisual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both\nrepresentation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world\nin a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual\nrepresentations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across\na wide array of manipulation challenges.

While existing\nmethods typically model human and animal motion separately, a joint\ncross-species approach offers key advantages, such as a unified representation\nand improved generalization. However, morphological differences across species\nremain a key challenge, often compromising motion plausibility. To address\nthis, we propose \\textbf{X-MoGen}, the first unified framework for\ncross-species text-driven motion generation covering both humans and animals.\nX-MoGen adopts a two-stage architecture. First, a conditional graph variational\nautoencoder learns canonical T-pose priors, while an autoencoder encodes motion\ninto a shared latent space regularized by morphological loss. In the second\nstage, we perform masked motion modeling to generate motion embeddings\nconditioned on textual descriptions. During training, a morphological\nconsistency module is employed to promote skeletal plausibility across species.\nTo support unified modeling, we construct \\textbf{UniMo4D}, a large-scale\ndataset of 115 species and 119k motion sequences, which integrates human and\nanimal motions under a shared skeletal topology for joint training. Extensive\nexperiments on UniMo4D demonstrate that X-MoGen outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods on both seen and unseen species.",

        "summary": "The arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR), a recent popular topic in\ncomputer vision, aims to achieve arbitrary-scale high-resolution recoveries\nfrom a low-resolution input image. This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign\nthe basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic\nrotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.\nThrough such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be\nimplemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to\noutput. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic\nequivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an\nequivariance structure. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated\nby experiments conducted on both simulated and real datasets. We also validate\nthat the proposed framework can be readily integrated into current ASISR\nmethods in a plug \\& play manner to further enhance their performance.",

        "summary": "Recently, research interest in person re-identification (ReID) has\nincreasingly focused on video-based scenarios, which are essential for robust\nsurveillance and security in varied and dynamic environments. However, existing\nvideo-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and\nselecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery\npair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nHierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,\nwhich leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,\nCLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently\nmodeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic\ngait--and adaptively integrating them. Specifically, HAMoBE includes two\nlevels: the first level extracts low-level features from multi-layer\nrepresentations provided by the frozen large model, while the second level\nconsists of specialized experts focusing on long-term, short-term, and temporal\nfeatures. To ensure robust matching, we introduce a new dual-input decision\ngating network that dynamically adjusts the contributions of each expert based\non their relevance to the input scenarios. Extensive evaluations on benchmarks\nlike MEVID demonstrate that our approach yields significant performance\nimprovements (e.g., +13.0% Rank-1 accuracy).",

        "summary": "Continual learning (CL) promises to allow neural networks to learn from\ncontinuous streams of inputs, instead of IID (independent and identically\ndistributed) sampling, which requires random access to a full dataset. This\nwould allow for much smaller storage requirements and self-sufficiency of\ndeployed systems that cope with natural distribution shifts, similarly to\nbiological learning. We focus on video CL employing a rehearsal-based approach,\nwhich reinforces past samples from a memory buffer. We posit that part of the\nreason why practical video CL is challenging is the high memory requirements of\nvideo, further exacerbated by long-videos and continual streams, which are at\nodds with the common rehearsal-buffer size constraints. To address this, we\npropose to use compressed vision, i.e. store video codes (embeddings) instead\nof raw inputs, and train a video classifier by IID sampling from this rolling\nbuffer. Training a video compressor online (so not depending on any pre-trained\nnetworks) means that it is also subject to catastrophic forgetting. We propose\na scheme to deal with this forgetting by refreshing video codes, which requires\ncareful decompression with a previous version of the network and recompression\nwith a new one. We name our method Continually Refreshed Amodal Memory (CRAM).\nWe expand current video CL benchmarks to large-scale settings, namely\nEpicKitchens-100 and Kinetics-700, storing thousands of relatively long videos\nin under 2 GB, and demonstrate empirically that our video CL method outperforms\nprior art with a significantly reduced memory footprint.",

        "title": "Modeling Rapid Contextual Learning in the Visual Cortex with Fast-Weight Deep Autoencoder Networks",
        "summary": "Recent neurophysiological studies have revealed that the early visual cortex\ncan rapidly learn global image context, as evidenced by a sparsification of\npopulation responses and a reduction in mean activity when exposed to familiar\nversus novel image contexts. This phenomenon has been attributed primarily to\nlocal recurrent interactions, rather than changes in feedforward or feedback\npathways, supported by both empirical findings and circuit-level modeling.\nRecurrent neural circuits capable of simulating these effects have been shown\nto reshape the geometry of neural manifolds, enhancing robustness and\ninvariance to irrelevant variations. In this study, we employ a Vision\nTransformer (ViT)-based autoencoder to investigate, from a functional\nperspective, how familiarity training can induce sensitivity to global context\nin the early layers of a deep neural network. We hypothesize that rapid\nlearning operates via fast weights, which encode transient or short-term memory\ntraces, and we explore the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to implement such\nfast weights within each Transformer layer. Our results show that (1) The\nproposed ViT-based autoencoder's self-attention circuit performs a manifold\ntransform similar to a neural circuit model of the familiarity effect. (2)\nFamiliarity training aligns latent representations in early layers with those\nin the top layer that contains global context information. (3) Familiarity\ntraining broadens the self-attention scope within the remembered image context.\n(4) These effects are significantly amplified by LoRA-based fast weights.\nTogether, these findings suggest that familiarity training introduces global\nsensitivity to earlier layers in a hierarchical network, and that a hybrid\nfast-and-slow weight architecture may provide a viable computational model for\nstudying rapid global context learning in the brain.",

Recently, pre-trained\nvision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance\nby leveraging semantic information to facilitate target tasks. By aligning\nvision and text embeddings, VLMs have shown notable success in bridging domain\ngaps. However, inherent differences naturally exist between modalities, which\nis known as modality gap. Our findings reveal that direct UDA with the presence\nof modality gap only transfers modality-invariant knowledge, leading to\nsuboptimal target performance. To address this limitation, we propose a unified\nmodality separation framework that accommodates both modality-specific and\nmodality-invariant components. During training, different modality components\nare disentangled from VLM features then handled separately in a unified manner.\nAt test time, modality-adaptive ensemble weights are automatically determined\nto maximize the synergy of different components. To evaluate instance-level\nmodality characteristics, we design a modality discrepancy metric to categorize\nsamples into modality-invariant, modality-specific, and uncertain ones. The\nmodality-invariant samples are exploited to facilitate cross-modal alignment,\nwhile uncertain ones are annotated to enhance model capabilities.

We argue that in\nimage compression, a sufficiently informative latent renders multi-step\nrefinement unnecessary.

        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning but often\nrequire resource-intensive training to adapt to new tasks. Prompt learning\ntechniques, such as CoOp and CoCoOp, offer efficient adaptation but tend to\noverfit to known classes, limiting generalization to unseen categories. We\nintroduce ProMIM, a plug-and-play framework that enhances conditional prompt\nlearning by integrating masked image modeling (MIM) into existing VLM\npipelines. ProMIM leverages a simple yet effective masking strategy to generate\nrobust, instance-conditioned prompts, seamlessly augmenting methods like CoOp\nand CoCoOp without altering their core architectures. By masking only visible\nimage patches and using these representations to guide prompt generation,\nProMIM improves feature robustness and mitigates overfitting, all while\nintroducing negligible additional computational cost. Extensive experiments\nacross zero-shot and few-shot classification tasks demonstrate that ProMIM\nconsistently boosts generalization performance when plugged into existing\napproaches, providing a practical, lightweight solution for real-world\nvision-language applications.",

        "summary": "As a critical modality for structural biology, cryogenic electron microscopy\n(cryo-EM) facilitates the determination of macromolecular structures at\nnear-atomic resolution. The core computational task in single-particle cryo-EM\nis to reconstruct the 3D electrostatic potential of a molecule from a large\ncollection of noisy 2D projections acquired at unknown orientations. Gaussian\nmixture models (GMMs) provide a continuous, compact, and physically\ninterpretable representation for molecular density and have recently gained\ninterest in cryo-EM reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on external\nconsensus maps or atomic models for initialization, limiting their use in\nself-contained pipelines. Addressing this issue, we introduce cryoGS, a\nGMM-based method that integrates Gaussian splatting with the physics of cryo-EM\nimage formation. In particular, we develop an orthogonal projection-aware\nGaussian splatting, with adaptations such as a normalization term and\nFFT-aligned coordinate system tailored for cryo-EM imaging.

        "summary": "We propose a method to extend foundational monocular depth estimators\n(FMDEs), trained on perspective images, to fisheye images. Despite being\ntrained on tens of millions of images, FMDEs are susceptible to the covariate\nshift introduced by changes in camera calibration (intrinsic, distortion)\nparameters, leading to erroneous depth estimates. Our method aligns the\ndistribution of latent embeddings encoding fisheye images to those of\nperspective images, enabling the reuse of FMDEs for fisheye cameras without\nretraining or finetuning. To this end, we introduce a set of Calibration Tokens\nas a light-weight adaptation mechanism that modulates the latent embeddings for\nalignment. By exploiting the already expressive latent space of FMDEs, we posit\nthat modulating their embeddings avoids the negative impact of artifacts and\nloss introduced in conventional recalibration or map projection to a canonical\nreference frame in the image space. Our method is self-supervised and does not\nrequire fisheye images but leverages publicly available large-scale perspective\nimage datasets. This is done by recalibrating perspective images to fisheye\nimages, and enforcing consistency between their estimates during training. We\nevaluate our approach with several FMDEs, on both indoors and outdoors, where\nwe consistently improve over state-of-the-art methods using a single set of\ntokens for both.

These methods typically employ a generic\nhighlight detection model for each test video, which is suboptimal as it fails\nto account for the unique characteristics and variations of individual test\nvideos. Such fixed models do not adapt to the diverse content, styles, or audio\nand visual qualities present in new, unseen test videos, leading to reduced\nhighlight detection performance. In this paper, we propose Highlight-TTA, a\ntest-time adaptation framework for video highlight detection that addresses\nthis limitation by dynamically adapting the model during testing to better\nalign with the specific characteristics of each test video, thereby improving\ngeneralization and highlight detection performance. Highlight-TTA is jointly\noptimized with an auxiliary task, cross-modality hallucinations, alongside the\nprimary highlight detection task. We utilize a meta-auxiliary training scheme\nto enable effective adaptation through the auxiliary task while enhancing the\nprimary task. During testing, we adapt the trained model using the auxiliary\ntask on the test video to further enhance its highlight detection performance.\nExtensive experiments with three state-of-the-art highlight detection models\nand three benchmark datasets show that the introduction of Highlight-TTA to\nthese models improves their performance, yielding superior results.",

        "summary": "With the rapid development of MLLMs, evaluating their visual capabilities has\nbecome increasingly crucial. Current benchmarks primarily fall into two main\ntypes: basic perception benchmarks, which focus on local details but lack deep\nreasoning (e.g., \"what is in the image?\"), and mainstream reasoning benchmarks,\nwhich concentrate on prominent image elements but may fail to assess subtle\nclues requiring intricate analysis. However, profound visual understanding and\ncomplex reasoning depend more on interpreting subtle, inconspicuous local\ndetails than on perceiving salient, macro-level objects. These details, though\noccupying minimal image area, often contain richer, more critical information\nfor robust analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce the VER-Bench, a novel\nframework to evaluate MLLMs' ability to: 1) identify fine-grained visual clues,\noften occupying on average just 0.25% of the image area; 2) integrate these\nclues with world knowledge for complex reasoning. Comprising 374 carefully\ndesigned questions across Geospatial, Temporal, Situational, Intent, System\nState, and Symbolic reasoning, each question in VER-Bench is accompanied by\nstructured evidence: visual clues and question-related reasoning derived from\nthem. VER-Bench reveals current models' limitations in extracting subtle visual\nevidence and constructing evidence-based arguments, highlighting the need to\nenhance models's capabilities in fine-grained visual evidence extraction,\nintegration, and reasoning for genuine visual understanding and human-like\nanalysis.

        "summary": "Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection\nand segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that\nreconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the\ndiffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the\nMVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and\nstatistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on\nMVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best\nmodel.\n  Code available at: https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/RADAR",

CoMAD distills from three\npretrained ViT-Base teachers, MAE, MoCo v3, and iBOT, each offering distinct\nsemantic and contextual priors. Rather than naively averaging teacher outputs,\nwe apply asymmetric masking: the student sees only 25 percent of patches while\neach teacher receives a progressively lighter, unique mask, forcing the student\nto interpolate missing features under richer contexts. Teacher embeddings are\naligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,\nthen fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by\ncombining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement. The student is trained\nwith dual-level KL divergence on visible tokens and reconstructed feature maps,\ncapturing both local and global structure. On ImageNet-1K, CoMAD's ViT-Tiny\nachieves 75.4 percent Top-1, an increment of 0.4 percent over the previous\nstate-of-the-art.

To this end, we introduce\nENTRep, the ACM Multimedia 2025 Grand Challenge on ENT endoscopy analysis,\nwhich integrates fine-grained anatomical classification with image-to-image and\ntext-to-image retrieval under bilingual (Vietnamese and English) clinical\nsupervision. Specifically, the dataset comprises expert-annotated images,\nlabeled for anatomical region and normal or abnormal status, and accompanied by\ndual-language narrative descriptions. In addition, we define three benchmark\ntasks, standardize the submission protocol, and evaluate performance on public\nand private test splits using server-side scoring.

To formally\nconnect noise levels in the feature space with corresponding input-space\nperturbations, we analyze the maximum singular value of the backbone network's\nJacobian. Our approach supports both full-reference (FR) and no-reference (NR)\nIQA models without requiring any architectural modifications, suitable for\nvarious scenarios. It is also computationally efficient, requiring a single\nbackbone forward pass per image. Compared to previous methods, it reduces\ninference time by 99.5% without certification and by 20.6% when certification\nis applied. We validate our method with extensive experiments on two benchmark\ndatasets, involving six widely-used FR and NR IQA models and comparisons\nagainst five state-of-the-art certified defenses.

Evaluation across five diverse\nbenchmarks demonstrates superiority over 15 state-of-the-art methods.

To address these issues, we\npropose a novel adversarial camouflage framework based on gradient\noptimization.

Additionally, we develop a gradient\ndecorrelation method, which prioritizes and orthogonalizes gradients based on\nloss values, enhancing stability and effectiveness in multi-angle optimization\nby eliminating redundant or conflicting updates. Extensive experimental results\non various detection models, angles and distances show that our method\nsignificantly exceeds the state of the art, with an average increase in attack\nsuccess rate (ASR) of 13.46% across distances and 11.03% across angles.\nFurthermore, empirical evaluation in real-world scenarios highlights the need\nfor more robust system design.",

Moreover, limited access to original data during\nincremental tasks often results in ambiguous inter-class decision boundaries.\nTo address these challenges, we propose SMP (Sculpting Margin Penalty), a novel\nFSCIL method that strategically integrates margin penalties at different stages\nwithin the parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, we introduce\nthe Margin-aware Intra-task Adapter Merging (MIAM) mechanism for base task\nlearning. MIAM trains two sets of low-rank adapters with distinct\nclassification losses: one with a margin penalty to enhance base-class\ndiscriminability, and the other without margin constraints to promote\ngeneralization to future new classes. These adapters are then adaptively merged\nto improve forward compatibility.

In this work, we introduce\n\\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights (KNOW)} prediction, a novel strategy that\nleverages structured forgetting and its inversion to synthesize\nknowledge-enriched weights. Our key insight is that sequential fine-tuning on\nprogressively downsized datasets induces a structured forgetting process, which\ncan be modeled and reversed to recover knowledge as if trained on a larger\ndataset. We construct a dataset of weight transitions governed by this\ncontrolled forgetting and employ meta-learning to model weight prediction\neffectively. Specifically, our \\textbf{KNowledge Overflowed Weights Nowcaster\n(KNOWN)} acts as a hyper-model that learns the general evolution of weights and\npredicts enhanced weights with improved generalization.

        "summary": "While Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive\ncapabilities in document understanding tasks, their ability to locate and\nreason about fine-grained details within complex documents remains\nunderstudied. Consider searching a restaurant menu for a specific nutritional\ndetail or identifying a disclaimer in a lengthy newspaper article tasks that\ndemand careful attention to small but significant details within a broader\nnarrative, akin to Finding Needles in Images (NiM). To address this gap, we\nintroduce NiM, a carefully curated benchmark spanning diverse real-world\ndocuments including newspapers, menus, and lecture images, specifically\ndesigned to evaluate MLLMs' capability in these intricate tasks. Building on\nthis, we further propose Spot-IT, a simple yet effective approach that enhances\nMLLMs capability through intelligent patch selection and Gaussian attention,\nmotivated from how humans zoom and focus when searching documents. Our\nextensive experiments reveal both the capabilities and limitations of current\nMLLMs in handling fine-grained document understanding tasks, while\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Spot-IT achieves significant\nimprovements over baseline methods, particularly in scenarios requiring precise\ndetail extraction from complex layouts.",

However, the\nrobustness of standard SSL methods to domain shift -- systematic differences\nacross data sources -- remains uncertain, posing an especially critical\nchallenge in biomedical imaging where batch effects can obscure true biological\nsignals. We present AdvDINO, a domain-adversarial self-supervised learning\nframework that integrates a gradient reversal layer into the DINOv2\narchitecture to promote domain-invariant feature learning. Applied to a\nreal-world cohort of six-channel multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) whole slide\nimages from non-small cell lung cancer patients, AdvDINO mitigates\nslide-specific biases to learn more robust and biologically meaningful\nrepresentations than non-adversarial baselines. Across $>5.46$ million mIF\nimage tiles, the model uncovers phenotype clusters with distinct proteomic\nprofiles and prognostic significance, and improves survival prediction in\nattention-based multiple instance learning.

        "summary": "Advancements in image sensing have elevated the importance of\nUltra-High-Definition Image Restoration (UHD IR). Traditional methods, such as\nextreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency\ndomain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible\ninformation loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure\nfrequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image\nartifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details. On the\nother hand, FIA ensures precise correction of color and illumination\ndistortions by operating in the frequency domain and leveraging the global\ncontext provided by it. Evaluating RetinexDual on four UHD IR tasks, namely\nderaining, deblurring, dehazing, and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE), shows\nthat it outperforms recent methods qualitatively and quantitatively. Ablation\nstudies demonstrate the importance of employing distinct designs for each\nbranch in RetinexDual, as well as the effectiveness of its various components.",

To address this limitation, this paper\nproposes a structural pruning framework termed Optimal Brain Connection.

Unlike existing first-order methods that\nassess parameters in isolation, our criterion explicitly captures both\nintra-component interactions and inter-layer dependencies. Second, we propose\nthe Equivalent Pruning mechanism, which utilizes autoencoders to retain the\ncontributions of all original connection--including pruned ones--during\nfine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that the Jacobian Criterion\noutperforms several popular metrics in preserving model performance, while the\nEquivalent Pruning mechanism effectively mitigates performance degradation\nafter fine-tuning.

To this end, we formalize the\nconcept of time-reversed Flow Matching (rFM) as a vector field regression along\na predefined probability path to transform unknown data distributions into\nstandard Gaussian. We bring two core observations that reshape our\nunderstanding of FM. First, we rigorously prove that FM with linear\ninterpolation probability paths is inherently non-invertible. Second, our\nanalysis reveals that employing reversed Gaussian probability paths in\nhigh-dimensional spaces can lead to trivial vector fields. This issue arises\ndue to the manifold-related constraints. Building on the second observation, we\npropose Worst Transport (WT) displacement interpolation to reconstruct a\nnon-probabilistic evolution path. The proposed WT-Flow enhances dynamical\ncontrol over sample trajectories, constructing ''degenerate potential wells''\nfor anomaly-free samples while allowing anomalous samples to escape. This novel\nunsupervised paradigm offers a theoretically grounded separation mechanism for\nanomalous samples. Notably, FM provides a computationally tractable framework\nthat scales to complex data. We present the first successful application of FM\nfor the unsupervised anomaly detection task, achieving state-of-the-art\nperformance at a single scale on the MVTec dataset.

The AI models were developed and validated using a\ndataset of 393 Spitz tumors and 379 conventional melanomas. Predictive\nperformance was measured using the AUROC and the accuracy. The performance of\nthe AI models was compared with that of four experienced pathologists in a\nreader study. Moreover, a simulation experiment was conducted to investigate\nthe impact of implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary diagnostic\ntesting on the workflow of the pathology department. The best AI model based on\nUNI features reached an AUROC of 0.95 and an accuracy of 0.86 in\ndifferentiating Spitz tumors from conventional melanomas. The genetic\naberration was predicted with an accuracy of 0.55 compared to 0.25 for randomly\nguessing. The diagnostic category was predicted with an accuracy of 0.51, where\nrandom chance-level accuracy equaled 0.33. On all three tasks, the AI models\nperformed better than the four pathologists, although differences were not\nstatistically significant for most individual comparisons. Based on the\nsimulation experiment, implementing AI-based recommendations for ancillary\ndiagnostic testing could reduce material costs, turnaround times, and\nexaminations.

Yet, it remains a challenge due to difficult visual\nconditions (e.g., weak textures, large viewpoint variations) and a scarcity of\nannotated data. To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a\ngeneralizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data\npre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a\ntwo-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual\ninteraction blocks for robust correspondence learning. To overcome data\nscarcity and improve domain diversity, we construct Endo-Mix6, the first\nmulti-domain dataset for endoscopic matching. Endo-Mix6 consists of\napproximately 1.2M real and synthetic image pairs across six domains, with\ncorrespondence labels generated using Structure-from-Motion and simulated\ntransformations. The diversity and scale of Endo-Mix6 introduce new challenges\nin training stability due to significant variations in dataset sizes,\ndistribution shifts, and error imbalance. To address them, a progressive\nmulti-objective training strategy is employed to promote balanced learning and\nimprove representation quality across domains. This enables EndoMatcher to\ngeneralize across unseen organs and imaging conditions in a zero-shot fashion.\nExtensive zero-shot matching experiments demonstrate that EndoMatcher increases\nthe number of inlier matches by 140.69% and 201.43% on the Hamlyn and Bladder\ndatasets over state-of-the-art methods, respectively, and improves the Matching\nDirection Prediction Accuracy (MDPA) by 9.40% on the Gastro-Matching dataset,\nachieving dense and accurate matching under challenging endoscopic conditions.\nThe code is publicly available at https://github.com/Beryl2000/EndoMatcher.",

Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily\ndesigned for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to\nMLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning\nabilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically\nrealizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based\nAD systems.

        "summary": "Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have demonstrated strong representational\ncapabilities through self-supervised pre-training on large-scale, unannotated\nhistopathology image datasets. However, their diverse yet opaque pretraining\ncontexts, shaped by both data-related and structural/training factors,\nintroduce latent biases that hinder generalisability and transparency in\ndownstream applications. In this paper, we propose AdaFusion, a novel\nprompt-guided inference framework that, to our knowledge, is among the very\nfirst to dynamically integrate complementary knowledge from multiple PFMs. Our\nmethod compresses and aligns tile-level features from diverse models and\nemploys a lightweight attention mechanism to adaptively fuse them based on\ntissue phenotype context. We evaluate AdaFusion on three real-world benchmarks\nspanning treatment response prediction, tumour grading, and spatial gene\nexpression inference. Our approach consistently surpasses individual PFMs\nacross both classification and regression tasks, while offering interpretable\ninsights into each model's biosemantic specialisation. These results highlight\nAdaFusion's ability to bridge heterogeneous PFMs, achieving both enhanced\nperformance and interpretability of model-specific inductive biases.",

        "summary": "Depth completion is a pivotal challenge in computer vision, aiming at\nreconstructing the dense depth map from a sparse one, typically with a paired\nRGB image. Existing learning based models rely on carefully prepared but\nlimited data, leading to significant performance degradation in\nout-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Recent foundation models have demonstrated\nexceptional robustness in monocular depth estimation through large-scale\ntraining, and using such models to enhance the robustness of depth completion\nmodels is a promising solution. In this work, we propose a novel depth\ncompletion framework that leverages depth foundation models to attain\nremarkable robustness without large-scale training. Specifically, we leverage a\ndepth foundation model to extract environmental cues, including structural and\nsemantic context, from RGB images to guide the propagation of sparse depth\ninformation into missing regions. We further design a dual-space propagation\napproach, without any learnable parameters, to effectively propagates sparse\ndepth in both 3D and 2D spaces to maintain geometric structure and local\nconsistency. To refine the intricate structure, we introduce a learnable\ncorrection module to progressively adjust the depth prediction towards the real\ndepth. We train our model on the NYUv2 and KITTI datasets as in-distribution\ndatasets and extensively evaluate the framework on 16 other datasets. Our\nframework performs remarkably well in the OOD scenarios and outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-art depth completion methods. Our models are released in\nhttps://github.com/shenglunch/PSD.",

However,\nexisting methods rely on resource-intensive offline incremental learning or\ndensely annotated support data, limiting their practicality. To address these\nlimitations, we propose HOW-Seg, the first human-in-the-loop framework for\nOW-Seg. Specifically, we construct class prototypes, the fundamental\nsegmentation units, directly on the query data, avoiding the prototype bias\ncaused by intra-class distribution shifts between the support and query data.\nBy leveraging sparse human annotations as guidance, HOW-Seg enables\nprototype-based segmentation for both base and novel classes. Considering the\nlack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical\nprototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which\ncorrespond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual\nawareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined\nprototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human\nfeedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality\nsegmentation for both base and novel classes.

Our method augments agent observations with prediction\nuncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses\nthese estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement\nlearning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt\nto distribution shifts.

As point clouds serve as a widely-used and\neasily accessible form of 3D representation, bridging the gap between point\nclouds and Gaussians becomes increasingly important. Recent studies have\nexplored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly\ngenerating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes\nraw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key\nidea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a\ndepth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across\ndifferent viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a\nsurface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the\nsurfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a\ndiffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing\nhard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation\ntask across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to\nchallenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes.

While existing methods achieve strong performance\nthrough extensive supervised training or reinforcement learning with labeled\nrewards, they remain constrained by the cost and availability of pixel-level\nannotations. We observe that when models generate multiple predictions for the\nsame GUI element, the spatial overlap patterns reveal implicit confidence\nsignals that can guide more accurate localization. Leveraging this insight, we\npropose GUI-RC (Region Consistency), a test-time scaling method that constructs\nspatial voting grids from multiple sampled predictions to identify consensus\nregions where models show highest agreement. Without any training, GUI-RC\nimproves accuracy by 2-3% across various architectures on ScreenSpot\nbenchmarks. We further introduce GUI-RCPO (Region Consistency Policy\nOptimization), which transforms these consistency patterns into rewards for\ntest-time reinforcement learning. By computing how well each prediction aligns\nwith the collective consensus, GUI-RCPO enables models to iteratively refine\ntheir outputs on unlabeled data during inference.

While Vision-Language\nPre-training (VLP) models offer a strong open-vocabulary foundation, they often\nstruggle with fine-grained localization under weak supervision and typically\nfail to explicitly leverage structured relational knowledge beyond basic\nsemantics, limiting performance especially for unseen classes. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose the Dual Adaptive Refinement Transfer (DART)\nframework. DART enhances a frozen VLP backbone via two synergistic adaptive\nmodules. For intra-class refinement, an Adaptive Refinement Module (ARM)\nrefines patch features adaptively, coupled with a novel Weakly Supervised Patch\nSelecting (WPS) loss that enables discriminative localization using only\nimage-level labels. Concurrently, for inter-class transfer, an Adaptive\nTransfer Module (ATM) leverages a Class Relationship Graph (CRG), constructed\nusing structured knowledge mined from a Large Language Model (LLM), and employs\ngraph attention network to adaptively transfer relational information between\nclass representations. DART is the first framework, to our knowledge, to\nexplicitly integrate external LLM-derived relational knowledge for adaptive\ninter-class transfer while simultaneously performing adaptive intra-class\nrefinement under weak supervision for OV-MLR.

DS-Align aligns local features with completed and global features\nacross all clients within the decision subspace, thus enabling locally\nindependent inference at each client. Moreover, we provide convergence theorems\nfor different algorithms used in training X-VFL, showing an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$\nconvergence rate for SGD-type algorithms and an $O(1/T)$ rate for PAGE-type\nalgorithms, where $T$ denotes the number of training update steps. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that X-VFL significantly\noutperforms existing methods, e.g., achieving a 15% improvement in accuracy on\nthe image CIFAR-10 dataset and a 43% improvement on the medical MIMIC-III\ndataset. These results validate the practical effectiveness and superiority of\nX-VFL, particularly in scenarios involving partially missing features and\nlocally independent inference.",

        "summary": "Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with\nextensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and\nhuman-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant\nocclusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss\nof target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain\nstable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on\nfull-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear\nconstant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion\nscenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced\ntracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more\nrobust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection\nfeatures from both the regression and classification branches of an object\ndetector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the\nfeature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head\nkeypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion\ncompared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative\nKalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions,\nintegrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes.\nBy combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed\nmethod offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded\nenvironments where occlusions are prevalent.",

        "summary": "Change detection in remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in various\nengineering applications, such as natural disaster monitoring, urban expansion\ntracking, and infrastructure management. Despite the remarkable progress of\ndeep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on\nspatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations\nhinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that\nfrequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify\nfine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of\nedge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we\npropose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).\nSpecifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the\ninput images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used\nto model local details and global structures, respectively. In the\nhigh-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)\nmodule to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a\nFrequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling\nof fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers\nto capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual\nDifference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling\nprecise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and\nlow-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity\nwith global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing\ndatasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and\nachieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Moreover, update selection in\ncentralized FL often relies on low-level parameter differences, which can be\nunreliable when client data is not independent and identically distributed, and\noffer clients little control. In this work, we propose a decentralized,\npeer-to-peer (P2P) FL framework.

Central to our method is an\nagreement score, computed on a local validation set, which quantifies the\nsemantic alignment of incoming updates in the function space with respect to\nthe clients reference model. Each client uses this score to select a tailored\nsubset of updates and performs aggregation with a regularization term that\nfurther stabilizes the training.

        "summary": "Although multi-instance learning (MIL) has succeeded in pathological image\nclassification, it faces the challenge of high inference costs due to the need\nto process thousands of patches from each gigapixel whole slide image (WSI). To\naddress this, we propose AHDMIL, an Asymmetric Hierarchical Distillation\nMulti-Instance Learning framework that enables fast and accurate classification\nby eliminating irrelevant patches through a two-step training process. AHDMIL\ncomprises two key components: the Dynamic Multi-Instance Network (DMIN), which\noperates on high-resolution WSIs, and the Dual-Branch Lightweight Instance\nPre-screening Network (DB-LIPN), which analyzes corresponding low-resolution\ncounterparts. In the first step, self-distillation (SD), DMIN is trained for\nWSI classification while generating per-instance attention scores to identify\nirrelevant patches. These scores guide the second step, asymmetric distillation\n(AD), where DB-LIPN learns to predict the relevance of each low-resolution\npatch. The relevant patches predicted by DB-LIPN have spatial correspondence\nwith patches in high-resolution WSIs, which are used for fine-tuning and\nefficient inference of DMIN.

        "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a competitive approach for novel view\nsynthesis (NVS) due to its advanced rendering efficiency through 3D Gaussian\nprojection and blending. However, Gaussians are treated equally weighted for\nrendering in most 3DGS methods, making them prone to overfitting, which is\nparticularly the case in sparse-view scenarios. To address this, we investigate\nhow adaptive weighting of Gaussians affects rendering quality, which is\ncharacterised by learned uncertainties proposed. This learned uncertainty\nserves two key purposes: first, it guides the differentiable update of Gaussian\nopacity while preserving the 3DGS pipeline integrity; second, the uncertainty\nundergoes soft differentiable dropout regularisation, which strategically\ntransforms the original uncertainty into continuous drop probabilities that\ngovern the final Gaussian projection and blending process for rendering.\nExtensive experimental results over widely adopted datasets demonstrate that\nour method outperforms rivals in sparse-view 3D synthesis, achieving higher\nquality reconstruction with fewer Gaussians in most datasets compared to\nexisting sparse-view approaches, e.g., compared to DropGaussian, our method\nachieves 3.27\\% PSNR improvements on the MipNeRF 360 dataset.",

Weakly\nSupervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized\nscene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG\nmethods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo\nlabels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,\nobject-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required\nfor DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals. To\naddress the challenges posed by external object detectors in WS-DSGG, we\npropose a Temporal-enhanced Relation-aware Knowledge Transferring (TRKT)\nmethod, which leverages knowledge to enhance detection in relation-aware\ndynamic scenarios. TRKT is built on two key components:(1)Relation-aware\nknowledge mining: we first employ object and relation class decoders that\ngenerate category-specific attention maps to highlight both object regions and\ninteractive areas. Then we propose an Inter-frame Attention Augmentation\nstrategy that exploits optical flow for neighboring frames to enhance the\nattention maps, making them motion-aware and robust to motion blur.

However, most CVL methods\noutput only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant\nobservations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess\nlocalization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.\nTo tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an\na-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as\na single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF\npose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a\ngeometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,\nand the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we\npropose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by\nestimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of\nthe locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc\nboosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures. After filtering\nout mislocalizations, Slice-Loc reduces the proportion of errors exceeding 10 m\nto under 3\\%. In cross-city tests on the DReSS dataset, Slice-Loc cuts the mean\nlocalization error from 4.47 m to 1.86 m and the mean orientation error from\n$\\mathbf{3.42^{\\circ}}$ to $\\mathbf{1.24^{\\circ}}$, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods.

To address this issue, we propose an effective identification\nmethod to support psychologists in conducting a large-scale automatic DPT.\nUnlike traditional sketch recognition, DPT more focus on the overall evaluation\nof the sketches, such as color usage and space utilization. Moreover, PPAT\nimposes a time limit and prohibits verbal reminders, resulting in low drawing\naccuracy and a lack of detailed depiction. To address these challenges, we\npropose the following efforts: (1) Providing an experimental environment for\nautomated analysis of PPAT sketches for depression assessment; (2) Offering a\nVisual-Semantic depression assessment based on LLM (VS-LLM) method; (3)\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method improves by 17.6% compared to\nthe psychologist assessment method. We anticipate that this work will\ncontribute to the research in mental state assessment based on PPAT sketches'\nelements recognition.

        "summary": "Gender classification is attractive in a range of applications, including\nsurveillance and monitoring, corporate profiling, and human-computer\ninteraction. Individuals' identities may be gleaned from information about\ntheir gender, which is a kind of soft biometric.Over the years, several methods\nfor determining a person's gender have been devised. Some of the most\nwell-known ones are based on physical characteristics like face, fingerprint,\npalmprint, DNA, ears, gait, and iris. On the other hand, facial features\naccount for the vast majority of gender classification methods. Also, the iris\nis a significant biometric trait because the iris, according to research,\nremains basically constant during an individual's life. Besides that, the iris\nis externally visible and is non-invasive to the user, which is important for\npractical applications. Furthermore, there are already high-quality methods for\nsegmenting and encoding iris images, and the current methods facilitate\nselecting and extracting attribute vectors from iris textures. This study\ndiscusses several approaches to determining gender. The previous works of\nliterature are briefly reviewed. Additionally, there are a variety of\nmethodologies for different steps of gender classification. This study provides\nresearchers with knowledge and analysis of the existing gender classification\napproaches. Also, it will assist researchers who are interested in this\nspecific area, as well as highlight the gaps and challenges in the field, and\nfinally provide suggestions and future paths for improvement.",

        "summary": "Real-time perception on edge platforms faces a core challenge: executing\nhigh-resolution object detection under stringent latency constraints on limited\ncomputing resources. Canvas-based attention scheduling was proposed in earlier\nwork as a mechanism to reduce the resource demands of perception subsystems. It\nconsolidates areas of interest in an input data frame onto a smaller area,\ncalled a canvas frame, that can be processed at the requisite frame rate. This\npaper extends prior canvas-based attention scheduling literature by (i)\nallowing for variable-size canvas frames and (ii) employing selectable canvas\nframe rates that may depart from the original data frame rate. We evaluate our\nsolution by running YOLOv11, as the perception module, on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin\nNano to inspect video frames from the Waymo Open Dataset.

        "summary": "The rapid proliferation of online multimedia content has intensified the\nspread of hate speech, presenting critical societal and regulatory challenges.\nWhile recent work has advanced multimodal hateful video detection, most\napproaches rely on coarse, video-level annotations that overlook the temporal\ngranularity of hateful content. This introduces substantial label noise, as\nvideos annotated as hateful often contain long non-hateful segments. In this\npaper, we investigate the impact of such label ambiguity through a fine-grained\napproach. Specifically, we trim hateful videos from the HateMM and\nMultiHateClip English datasets using annotated timestamps to isolate explicitly\nhateful segments. We then conduct an exploratory analysis of these trimmed\nsegments to examine the distribution and characteristics of both hateful and\nnon-hateful content. This analysis highlights the degree of semantic overlap\nand the confusion introduced by coarse, video-level annotations. Finally,\ncontrolled experiments demonstrated that time-stamp noise fundamentally alters\nmodel decision boundaries and weakens classification confidence, highlighting\nthe inherent context dependency and temporal continuity of hate speech\nexpression. Our findings provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of\nmultimodal hateful videos and highlight the need for temporally aware models\nand benchmarks for improved robustness and interpretability.

        "summary": "3D Cloth modeling and simulation is essential for avatars creation in several\nfields, such as fashion, entertainment, and animation. Achieving high-quality\nresults is challenging due to the large variability of clothed body especially\nin the generation of realistic wrinkles. 3D scan acquisitions provide more\naccuracy in the representation of real-world objects but lack semantic\ninformation that can be inferred with a reliable semantic reconstruction\npipeline. To this aim, shape segmentation plays a crucial role in identifying\nthe semantic shape parts. However, current 3D shape segmentation methods are\ndesigned for scene understanding and interpretation and only few work is\ndevoted to modeling. In the context of clothed body modeling the segmentation\nis a preliminary step for fully semantic shape parts reconstruction namely the\nunderlying body and the involved garments. These parts represent several layers\nwith strong overlap in contrast with standard segmentation methods that provide\ndisjoint sets. In this work we propose a new 3D point cloud segmentation\nparadigm where each 3D point can be simultaneously associated to different\nlayers. In this fashion we can estimate the underlying body parts and the\nunseen clothed regions, i.e., the part of a cloth occluded by the clothed-layer\nabove. We name this segmentation paradigm clothed human layering. We create a\nnew synthetic dataset that simulates very realistic 3D scans with the ground\ntruth of the involved clothing layers. We propose and evaluate different neural\nnetwork settings to deal with 3D clothing layering. We considered both coarse\nand fine grained per-layer garment identification. Our experiments demonstrates\nthe benefit in introducing proper strategies for the segmentation on the\ngarment domain on both the synthetic and real-world scan datasets.",

Recently,\npre-trained foundation models have shown strong performance across domains such\nas autonomous driving, medical imaging, and industrial inspection. However,\nthey struggle with historical maps. These models are trained on modern or\ndomain-specific images, where patterns can be tied to predefined concepts\nthrough common sense or expert knowledge. Historical maps lack such consistency\n-- similar concepts can appear in vastly different shapes and styles. To\naddress this, we propose On-Need Declarative (OND) knowledge-based prompting,\nwhich introduces explicit prompts to guide the model on what patterns\ncorrespond to which concepts. This allows users to specify the target concept\nand pattern during inference (on-need inference). We implement this by\nreplacing the prompt encoder of the foundation model SAM with our OND prompting\nmechanism and fine-tune it on historical maps. The resulting model is called\nSMOL-MapSeg (Show Me One Label). Experiments show that SMOL-MapSeg can\naccurately segment classes defined by OND knowledge.

        "summary": "Chirality information (i.e. information that allows distinguishing left from\nright) is ubiquitous for various data modes in computer vision, including\nimages, videos, point clouds, and meshes. While chirality has been extensively\nstudied in the image domain, its exploration in shape analysis (such as point\nclouds and meshes) remains underdeveloped. Although many shape vertex\ndescriptors have shown appealing properties (e.g. robustness to rigid-body\ntransformations), they are often not able to disambiguate between left and\nright symmetric parts. Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in\ndifferent shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features\nwithin current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor\nbecomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose\nan unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape\nvertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.\nWe evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and\nqualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks\nincluding left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation\ndemonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility.

        "title": "CF3: Compact and Fast 3D Feature Fields",
        "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has begun incorporating rich information from 2D\nfoundation models. However, most approaches rely on a bottom-up optimization\nprocess that treats raw 2D features as ground truth, incurring increased\ncomputational costs. We propose a top-down pipeline for constructing compact\nand fast 3D Gaussian feature fields, namely, CF3. We first perform a fast\nweighted fusion of multi-view 2D features with pre-trained Gaussians. This\napproach enables training a per-Gaussian autoencoder directly on the lifted\nfeatures, instead of training autoencoders in the 2D domain. As a result, the\nautoencoder better aligns with the feature distribution. More importantly, we\nintroduce an adaptive sparsification method that optimizes the Gaussian\nattributes of the feature field while pruning and merging the redundant\nGaussians, constructing an efficient representation with preserved geometric\ndetails. Our approach achieves a competitive 3D feature field using as little\nas 5% of the Gaussians compared to Feature-3DGS.",
