The new set-up involves a\ntemplate-driven generator, runner, and evaluation framework that, through\nsystematic permutations of convolutional, normalization, activation, and\ndropout layers, can create more than 1,200 variants of neural networks. Fractal\ntemplates allow for structural recursion and multi-column pathways, thus,\nmodels become deeper and wider in a balanced way. Training utilizes PyTorch,\nAutomatic Mixed Precision (AMP), and gradient checkpointing and is carried out\non the CIFAR-10 dataset for five epochs. The outcomes show that fractal-based\narchitectures are capable of strong performance and are computationally\nefficient.

The system can\nquickly detect and monitor dumped waste using a street-level camera and object\ndetection algorithm. Data was collected from the Sangareddy district in\nTelangana, India. A series of comprehensive experiments was carried out using\nthe proposed dataset to assess the accuracy and overall performance of various\nobject detection models. Specifically, we performed an in-depth evaluation of\nYOLOv8, YOLOv10, YOLO11m, and RT-DETR on our dataset. Among these models,\nYOLO11m achieved the highest accuracy of 92.39\\% in waste detection,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in detecting waste. Additionally, it attains an\nmAP@50 of 0.91, highlighting its high precision. These findings confirm that\nthe object detection model is well-suited for monitoring and tracking waste\ndumping events at GVP locations. Furthermore, the system effectively captures\nwaste disposal patterns, including hourly, daily, and weekly dumping trends,\nensuring comprehensive daily and nightly monitoring.",

        "summary": "Fast and flexible 3D scene reconstruction from unstructured image collections\nremains a significant challenge. We present YoNoSplat, a feedforward model that\nreconstructs high-quality 3D Gaussian Splatting representations from an\narbitrary number of images. Our model is highly versatile, operating\neffectively with both posed and unposed, calibrated and uncalibrated inputs.\nYoNoSplat predicts local Gaussians and camera poses for each view, which are\naggregated into a global representation using either predicted or provided\nposes. To overcome the inherent difficulty of jointly learning 3D Gaussians and\ncamera parameters, we introduce a novel mixing training strategy. This approach\nmitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using\nground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to\na mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training\ninstability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem\nby a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding\ncamera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic\nparameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat demonstrates\nexceptional efficiency, reconstructing a scene from 100 views (at 280x518\nresolution) in just 2.69 seconds on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU. It achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks in both pose-free and\npose-dependent settings. Our project page is at\nhttps://botaoye.github.io/yonosplat/.",

        "summary": "Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) aims to adapt a source-pretrained object\ndetector to a target domain without access to source data. However, existing\nSFOD methods predominantly rely on internal knowledge from the source model,\nwhich limits their capacity to generalize across domains and often results in\nbiased pseudo-labels, thereby hindering both transferability and\ndiscriminability. In contrast, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), pretrained on\nmassive and diverse data, exhibit strong perception capabilities and broad\ngeneralization, yet their potential remains largely untapped in the SFOD\nsetting. In this paper, we propose a novel SFOD framework that leverages VFMs\nas external knowledge sources to jointly enhance feature alignment and label\nquality. Specifically, we design three VFM-based modules: (1) Patch-weighted\nGlobal Feature Alignment (PGFA) distills global features from VFMs using\npatch-similarity-based weighting to enhance global feature transferability; (2)\nPrototype-based Instance Feature Alignment (PIFA) performs instance-level\ncontrastive learning guided by momentum-updated VFM prototypes; and (3)\nDual-source Enhanced Pseudo-label Fusion (DEPF) fuses predictions from\ndetection VFMs and teacher models via an entropy-aware strategy to yield more\nreliable supervision.

In this paper, we propose VADER, an\nLLM-driven framework for Video Anomaly unDErstanding, which integrates keyframe\nobject Relation features with visual cues to enhance anomaly comprehension from\nvideo.

In\nthe last decade, a large body of work has emerged on local robustness, i.e.,\nchecking if the decision of a neural network remains unchanged when the input\nis slightly perturbed. However, many of these approaches require specialized\nencoding and often ignore the confidence of a neural network on its output. In\nthis paper, our goal is to build a generalized framework to specify and verify\nvariants of robustness in neural network verification. We propose a\nspecification framework using a simple grammar, which is flexible enough to\ncapture most existing variants. This allows us to introduce new variants of\nrobustness that take into account the confidence of the neural network in its\noutputs. Next, we develop a novel and powerful unified technique to verify all\nsuch variants in a homogeneous way, viz., by adding a few additional layers to\nthe neural network. This enables us to use any state-of-the-art neural network\nverification tool, without having to tinker with the encoding within, while\nincurring an approximation error that we show is bounded. We perform an\nextensive experimental evaluation over a large suite of 8870 benchmarks having\n138M parameters in a largest network, and show that we are able to capture a\nwide set of robustness variants and outperform direct encoding approaches by a\nsignificant margin.",

This has led to incremental improvements without a deep\nunderstanding of the current failures. While it is straightforward to look at\nsituations where the model fails, it is hard to understand the underlying\nreason. This motivates us to conduct a systematic study, where inputs to the\nmodel are perturbed and the predictions observed. We introduce PlanT 2.0, a\nlightweight, object-centric planning transformer designed for autonomous\ndriving research in CARLA. The object-level representation enables controlled\nanalysis, as the input can be easily perturbed (e.g., by changing the location\nor adding or removing certain objects), in contrast to sensor-based models.

Although NR-VQA\nmodels attempt to infer mean opinion scores (MOS), their modeling of subjective\nscores for compressed content remains limited due to the absence of\nfine-grained perceptual annotations of artifact types.

In this paper, we propose \\textbf{StreamKV}, a\ntraining-free framework that seamlessly equips Video-LLMs with advanced KV\ncache retrieval and compression.

Specifically, we adapt the matryoshka\nrepresentation learning paradigm to efficiently train across multiple audio and\nvisual granularities, reducing its inherent training resource use. Furthermore,\nwe explore three LoRA-based strategies for adapting the backbone LLM, balancing\nshared and task-specific specialization. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3 show that\nOmni-AVSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art\nbaselines while training a single model at substantially lower training and\ndeployment resource use. The model also remains robust under acoustic noise,\nand we analyze its scaling behavior as LLM size increases, providing insights\ninto the trade-off between performance and efficiency.",

To address this significant gap, we introduce MVU-Eval,\nthe first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating Multi-Video Understanding for\nMLLMs. Specifically, our MVU-Eval mainly assesses eight core competencies\nthrough 1,824 meticulously curated question-answer pairs spanning 4,959 videos\nfrom diverse domains, addressing both fundamental perception tasks and\nhigh-order reasoning tasks. These capabilities are rigorously aligned with\nreal-world applications such as multi-sensor synthesis in autonomous systems\nand cross-angle sports analytics.

To address these problems, we propose a novel 4D\ngeneration network called 4DSTR, which modulates generative 4D Gaussian\nSplatting with spatial-temporal rectification. Specifically, temporal\ncorrelation across generated 4D sequences is designed to rectify deformable\nscales and rotations and guarantee temporal consistency.

Concretely, our approach combines a vision-language\nmodel's encoder with a transformer decoder, employs Distance-Based OOD prompts\nlocated at varying semantic distances from in-distribution (ID) classes, and\nutilizes OOD Semantic Augmentation for OOD representations. By aligning visual\nand textual information, our approach effectively generalizes to unseen objects\nand provides robust OOD segmentation in diverse driving environments.\n  We conduct extensive experiments on publicly available OOD segmentation\ndatasets such as Fishyscapes, Segment-Me-If-You-Can, and Road Anomaly datasets,\ndemonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across\nboth pixel-level and object-level evaluations.

While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in\ntwo key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\\ noise, we apply\nstructured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of\nsegmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and\npreserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov\nregularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward\nidentity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and\nfurther improves both detection and segmentation accuracy.

This study introduces a remote\nsensing-driven framework to quantify WASH accessibility-specifically to water\npumps, latrines, and bathing cubicles-in the Rohingya camps of Cox's Bazar, one\nof the world's most densely populated displacement settings. Detecting refugee\nshelters in such emergent camps presents substantial challenges, primarily due\nto their dense spatial configuration and irregular geometric patterns. Using\nsub-meter satellite images, we develop a semi-supervised segmentation framework\nthat achieves an F1-score of 76.4% in detecting individual refugee shelters.\nApplying the framework across multi-year data reveals declining WASH\naccessibility, driven by rapid refugee population growth and reduced facility\navailability, rising from 25 people per facility in 2022 to 29.4 in 2025.\nGender-disaggregated analysis further shows that women and girls experience\nreduced accessibility, in scenarios with inadequate safety-related segregation\nin WASH facilities. These findings suggest the importance of demand-responsive\nallocation strategies that can identify areas with under-served\npopulations-such as women and girls-and ensure that limited infrastructure\nserves the greatest number of people in settings with fixed or shrinking\nbudgets.

A critical flaw in existing methods is that the\npoison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus\nnoticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This\npaper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this\naccuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative\nClean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to\nidentify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and\nstealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign\ntask-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an\nextremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than\n1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully\nadapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the\nfirst demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation.\nGCB also exhibits resilience against most of the existing backdoor defenses.",

        "summary": "Music induced painting is a unique artistic practice, where visual artworks\nare created under the influence of music. Evaluating whether a painting\nfaithfully reflects the music that inspired it poses a challenging perceptual\nassessment task. Existing methods primarily rely on emotion recognition models\nto assess the similarity between music and painting, but such models introduce\nconsiderable noise and overlook broader perceptual cues beyond emotion. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel framework for music induced\npainting assessment that directly models perceptual coherence between music and\nvisual art. We introduce MPD, the first large scale dataset of music painting\npairs annotated by domain experts based on perceptual coherence. To better\nhandle ambiguous cases, we further collect pairwise preference annotations.\nBuilding on this dataset, we present MPJudge, a model that integrates music\nfeatures into a visual encoder via a modulation based fusion mechanism. To\neffectively learn from ambiguous cases, we adopt Direct Preference Optimization\nfor training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting approaches. Qualitative results further show that our model more\naccurately identifies music relevant regions in paintings.",

However, current research tends to focus narrowly on single-object\nprompts with limited contextual diversity. In reality, each object or attribute\nwithin a prompt can contribute to bias. For example, the prompt \"an assistant\nwearing a pink hat\" may reflect female-inclined biases associated with a pink\nhat. The neglected joint effects of the semantic binding in the prompts cause\nsignificant failures in current debiasing approaches. This work initiates a\npreliminary investigation on how bias manifests under semantic binding, where\ncontextual associations between objects and attributes influence generative\noutcomes. We demonstrate that the underlying bias distribution can be amplified\nbased on these associations.

This\nframework achieves over 10% debiasing improvement in compositional generation\ntasks. Our analysis of bias scores across various attribute-object bindings and\ntoken decorrelation highlights a fundamental challenge: reducing bias without\ndisrupting essential semantic relationships.

Vision-based gesture recognition\nsuffers from high computational cost, sensitivity to lighting conditions, and\nprivacy leakage concerns. Acoustic sensing provides an attractive alternative:\nby emitting inaudible high-frequency signals and capturing their reflections,\nchannel impulse response (CIR) encodes how gestures perturb the acoustic field\nin a low-cost and user-transparent manner. However, existing CIR-based gesture\nrecognition methods often rely on extensive training of models on large labeled\ndatasets, making them unsuitable for few-shot VR scenarios.

Data augmentation via synthetic fake face generation\neffectively enhances generalization, yet current SoTA methods rely on fixed\nstrategies-raising a key question: Is a single static augmentation sufficient,\nor does the diversity of forgery features demand dynamic approaches? We argue\nexisting methods overlook the evolving complexity of real-world forgeries\n(e.g., facial warping, expression manipulation), which fixed policies cannot\nfully simulate. To address this, we propose CRDA (Curriculum\nReinforcement-Learning Data Augmentation), a novel framework guiding detectors\nto progressively master multi-domain forgery features from simple to complex.\nCRDA synthesizes augmented samples via a configurable pool of forgery\noperations and dynamically generates adversarial samples tailored to the\ndetector's current learning state. Central to our approach is integrating\nreinforcement learning (RL) and causal inference. An RL agent dynamically\nselects augmentation actions based on detector performance to efficiently\nexplore the vast augmentation space, adapting to increasingly challenging\nforgeries. Simultaneously, the agent introduces action space variations to\ngenerate heterogeneous forgery patterns, guided by causal inference to mitigate\nspurious correlations-suppressing task-irrelevant biases and focusing on\ncausally invariant features. This integration ensures robust generalization by\ndecoupling synthetic augmentation patterns from the model's learned\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments show our method significantly improves\ndetector generalizability, outperforming SOTA methods across multiple\ncross-domain datasets.",

        "title": "From Pretrain to Pain: Adversarial Vulnerability of Video Foundation Models Without Task Knowledge",
        "summary": "Large-scale Video Foundation Models (VFMs) has significantly advanced various\nvideo-related tasks, either through task-specific models or Multi-modal Large\nLanguage Models (MLLMs). However, the open accessibility of VFMs also\nintroduces critical security risks, as adversaries can exploit full knowledge\nof the VFMs to launch potent attacks. This paper investigates a novel and\npractical adversarial threat scenario: attacking downstream models or MLLMs\nfine-tuned from open-source VFMs, without requiring access to the victim task,\ntraining data, model query, and architecture. In contrast to conventional\ntransfer-based attacks that rely on task-aligned surrogate models, we\ndemonstrate that adversarial vulnerabilities can be exploited directly from the\nVFMs. To this end, we propose the Transferable Video Attack (TVA), a\ntemporal-aware adversarial attack method that leverages the temporal\nrepresentation dynamics of VFMs to craft effective perturbations. TVA\nintegrates a bidirectional contrastive learning mechanism to maximize the\ndiscrepancy between the clean and adversarial features, and introduces a\ntemporal consistency loss that exploits motion cues to enhance the sequential\nimpact of perturbations. TVA avoids the need to train expensive surrogate\nmodels or access to domain-specific data, thereby offering a more practical and\nefficient attack strategy. Extensive experiments across 24 video-related tasks\ndemonstrate the efficacy of TVA against downstream models and MLLMs, revealing\na previously underexplored security vulnerability in the deployment of video\nmodels.",

        "summary": "Deep neural networks have recently achieved notable progress in 3D point\ncloud recognition, yet their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations poses\ncritical security challenges in practical deployments. Conventional defense\nmechanisms struggle to address the evolving landscape of multifaceted attack\npatterns. Through systematic analysis of existing defenses, we identify that\ntheir unsatisfactory performance primarily originates from an entangled feature\nspace, where adversarial attacks can be performed easily. To this end, we\npresent 3D-ANC, a novel approach that capitalizes on the Neural Collapse (NC)\nmechanism to orchestrate discriminative feature learning. In particular, NC\ndepicts where last-layer features and classifier weights jointly evolve into a\nsimplex equiangular tight frame (ETF) arrangement, establishing maximally\nseparable class prototypes. However, leveraging this advantage in 3D\nrecognition confronts two substantial challenges: (1) prevalent class imbalance\nin point cloud datasets, and (2) complex geometric similarities between object\ncategories. To tackle these obstacles, our solution combines an ETF-aligned\nclassification module with an adaptive training framework consisting of\nrepresentation-balanced learning (RBL) and dynamic feature direction loss\n(FDL). 3D-ANC seamlessly empowers existing models to develop disentangled\nfeature spaces despite the complexity in 3D data distribution. Comprehensive\nevaluations state that 3D-ANC significantly improves the robustness of models\nwith various structures on two datasets. For instance, DGCNN's classification\naccuracy is elevated from 27.2% to 80.9% on ModelNet40 -- a 53.7% absolute gain\nthat surpasses leading baselines by 34.0%.",

        "summary": "3D point cloud classification is a fundamental task in safety-critical\napplications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.\nHowever, recent studies reveal that point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to\nstructured adversarial perturbations and geometric corruptions, posing risks to\ntheir deployment in safety-critical scenarios. Existing certified defenses\nlimit point-wise perturbations but overlook subtle geometric distortions that\npreserve individual points yet alter the overall structure, potentially leading\nto misclassification. In this work, we propose FreqCert, a novel certification\nframework that departs from conventional spatial domain defenses by shifting\nrobustness analysis to the frequency domain, enabling structured certification\nagainst global L2-bounded perturbations. FreqCert first transforms the input\npoint cloud via the graph Fourier transform (GFT), then applies structured\nfrequency-aware subsampling to generate multiple sub-point clouds. Each\nsub-cloud is independently classified by a standard model, and the final\nprediction is obtained through majority voting, where sub-clouds are\nconstructed based on spectral similarity rather than spatial proximity, making\nthe partitioning more stable under L2 perturbations and better aligned with the\nobject's intrinsic structure. We derive a closed-form lower bound on the\ncertified L2 robustness radius and prove its tightness under minimal and\ninterpretable assumptions, establishing a theoretical foundation for frequency\ndomain certification. Extensive experiments on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN\ndatasets demonstrate that FreqCert consistently achieves higher certified\naccuracy and empirical accuracy under strong perturbations. Our results suggest\nthat spectral representations provide an effective pathway toward certifiable\nrobustness in 3D point cloud recognition.",

One of the key issues pertains to limited real-world\nannotated data to facilitate generalizable models. The common practice to\ntackle this issue is to simulate new data. Although synthetic datasets offer\nscalability and perfect labels, their designer-crafted scenes fail to capture\nreal-world complexity and sensor noise, resulting in a synthetic-to-real domain\ngap. Moreover, no benchmark provides synchronized real and simulated point\nclouds for segmentation-oriented domain shift analysis. We introduce TrueCity,\nthe first urban semantic segmentation benchmark with cm-accurate annotated\nreal-world point clouds, semantic 3D city models, and annotated simulated point\nclouds representing the same city. TrueCity proposes segmentation classes\naligned with international 3D city modeling standards, enabling consistent\nevaluation of synthetic-to-real gap. Our extensive experiments on common\nbaselines quantify domain shift and highlight strategies for exploiting\nsynthetic data to enhance real-world 3D scene understanding.

        "summary": "Explanation-guided learning (EGL) has shown promise in aligning model\npredictions with interpretable reasoning, particularly in computer vision\ntasks. However, most approaches rely on external annotations or heuristic-based\nsegmentation to supervise model explanations, which can be noisy, imprecise and\ndifficult to scale. In this work, we provide both empirical and theoretical\nevidence that low-quality supervision signals can degrade model performance\nrather than improve it. In response, we propose ALIGN, a novel framework that\njointly trains a classifier and a masker in an iterative manner. The masker\nlearns to produce soft, task-relevant masks that highlight informative regions,\nwhile the classifier is optimized for both prediction accuracy and alignment\nbetween its saliency maps and the learned masks. By leveraging high-quality\nmasks as guidance, ALIGN improves both interpretability and generalizability,\nshowing its superiority across various settings. Experiments on the two domain\ngeneralization benchmarks, VLCS and Terra Incognita, show that ALIGN\nconsistently outperforms six strong baselines in both in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution settings. Besides, ALIGN also yields superior explanation\nquality concerning sufficiency and comprehensiveness, highlighting its\neffectiveness in producing accurate and interpretable models.",

In\nthis study, we introduce PlantTraitNet, a multi-modal, multi-task\nuncertainty-aware deep learning framework that predictsfour key plant traits\n(plant height, leaf area, specific leaf area, and nitrogen content) from\ncitizen science photos using weak supervision. By aggregating individual trait\npredictions across space, we generate global maps of trait distributions.

Our results show that\nPlantTraitNet consistently outperforms existing trait maps across all evaluated\ntraits, demonstrating that citizen science imagery, when integrated with\ncomputer vision and geospatial AI, enables not only scalable but also more\naccurate global trait mapping.

        "summary": "Monocular 3D Visual Grounding (Mono3DVG) is an emerging task that locates 3D\nobjects in RGB images using text descriptions with geometric cues. However,\nexisting methods face two key limitations. Firstly, they often over-rely on\nhigh-certainty keywords that explicitly identify the target object while\nneglecting critical spatial descriptions. Secondly, generalized textual\nfeatures contain both 2D and 3D descriptive information, thereby capturing an\nadditional dimension of details compared to singular 2D or 3D visual features.\nThis characteristic leads to cross-dimensional interference when refining\nvisual features under text guidance. To overcome these challenges, we propose\nMono3DVG-EnSD, a novel framework that integrates two key components: the\nCLIP-Guided Lexical Certainty Adapter (CLIP-LCA) and the Dimension-Decoupled\nModule (D2M). The CLIP-LCA dynamically masks high-certainty keywords while\nretaining low-certainty implicit spatial descriptions, thereby forcing the\nmodel to develop a deeper understanding of spatial relationships in captions\nfor object localization. Meanwhile, the D2M decouples dimension-specific\n(2D/3D) textual features from generalized textual features to guide\ncorresponding visual features at same dimension, which mitigates\ncross-dimensional interference by ensuring dimensionally-consistent cross-modal\ninteractions. Through comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies on the\nMono3DRefer dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance\nacross all metrics.

In this\nexperiment, we classify colorless microplastic particles (50-300 $\\mu$m) by\nilluminating them with linearly polarized laser light and capturing their\nreflected signals using a polarization-sensitive camera. This reflection-based\ntechnique successfully circumvents the transmission-based interference issues\nthat plague many conventional methods when applied in water. Using a deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) for image-based classification, we\nsuccessfully identified three common polymer types, high-density polyethylene,\nlow-density polyethylene, and polypropylene, achieving a peak mean\nclassification accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. A subsequent feature\nhierarchy analysis demonstrated that the CNN's decision-making process relies\nmainly on the microstructural integrity and internal texture (polarization\npatterns) of the particle rather than its macroshape. Critically, we found that\nthe Angle of Linear Polarization (AOLP) signal is significantly more robust\nagainst contextual noise than the Degree of Linear Polarization (DOLP) signal.\nWhile the AOLP-based classification achieved superior overall performance, its\nstrength lies in distinguishing between the two polyethylene plastics, showing\na lower confusion rate between high-density and low-density polyethylene.\nConversely, the DOLP signal demonstrated slightly worse overall classification\nresults but excels at accurately identifying the polypropylene class, which it\nisolated with greater success than AOLP.",

The second stage uses a layout-conditioned\ndiffusion model to synthesize a photorealistic image adhering to this layout.\nWe find that task decomposition is critical for LLM-based spatial planning; by\nsimplifying the initial generation to core objects and completing the layout\nwith rule-based insertion, we improve object recall from 57.2% to 99.9% for\ncomplex scenes.

Yet, most models are trained to map short prompts into detailed\nimages, creating a gap between sparse textual input and rich visual outputs.\nThis mismatch reduces controllability, as models often fill in missing details\narbitrarily, biasing toward average user preferences and limiting precision for\nprofessional use. We address this limitation by training the first open-source\ntext-to-image model on long structured captions, where every training sample is\nannotated with the same set of fine-grained attributes. This design maximizes\nexpressive coverage and enables disentangled control over visual factors. To\nprocess long captions efficiently, we propose DimFusion, a fusion mechanism\nthat integrates intermediate tokens from a lightweight LLM without increasing\ntoken length.

By assessing how well real images can be reconstructed\nthrough a captioning-generation loop, TaBR directly measures controllability\nand expressiveness, even for very long captions where existing evaluation\nmethods fail.

We provide the first comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon\nthrough a novel analytical framework termed as ``distillation dynamics\",\ncombining frequency spectrum analysis, information entropy metrics, and\nactivation magnitude tracking. Our investigation reveals that ViTs exhibit a\ndistinctive U-shaped information processing pattern: initial compression\nfollowed by expansion. We identify the root cause of negative transfer in\nfeature distillation: a fundamental representational paradigm mismatch between\nteacher and student models. Through frequency-domain analysis, we show that\nteacher models employ distributed, high-dimensional encoding strategies in\nlater layers that smaller student models cannot replicate due to limited\nchannel capacity. This mismatch causes late-layer feature alignment to actively\nharm student performance.

        "summary": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are widely used for aerial photography and\nremote sensing applications. One of the main challenges is to stitch together\nmultiple images into a single high-resolution image that covers a large area.\nFeaturebased image stitching algorithms are commonly used but can suffer from\nerrors and ambiguities in feature detection and matching. To address this,\nseveral approaches have been proposed, including using bundle adjustment\ntechniques or direct image alignment. In this paper, we present a novel method\nthat uses a combination of IMU data and computer vision techniques for\nstitching images captured by a UAV. Our method involves several steps such as\nestimating the displacement and rotation of the UAV between consecutive images,\ncorrecting for perspective distortion, and computing a homography matrix. We\nthen use a standard image stitching algorithm to align and blend the images\ntogether. Our proposed method leverages the additional information provided by\nthe IMU data, corrects for various sources of distortion, and can be easily\nintegrated into existing UAV workflows. Our experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness and robustness of our method, outperforming some of the existing\nfeature-based image stitching algorithms in terms of accuracy and reliability,\nparticularly in challenging scenarios such as large displacements, rotations,\nand variations in camera pose.",

Recently, denoisers\ninduced by generative priors have been successfully integrated into regularized\noptimization methods for image restoration under Gaussian noise. However, their\napplication to non-Gaussian noise--such as impulse noise--remains largely\nunexplored. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play image restoration\nframework based on generative diffusion priors for robust removal of general\nnoise types, including impulse noise. Within the maximum a posteriori (MAP)\nestimation framework, the data fidelity term is adapted to the specific noise\nmodel. Departing from the conventional least-squares loss used for Gaussian\nnoise, we introduce a generalized Gaussian scale mixture-based loss, which\napproximates a wide range of noise distributions and leads to an $\\ell_q$-norm\n($0<q\\leq2$) fidelity term. This optimization problem is addressed using an\niteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) approach, wherein the proximal step\ninvolving the generative prior is efficiently performed via a diffusion-based\ndenoiser.

Yet, dense disparity\nsupervision is nearly impossible due to anatomical constraints, typically\nlimiting annotations to only a few image-level labels acquired before the\nendoscope enters deep body cavities. Teacher-Student Learning (TSL) offers a\npromising solution by leveraging a teacher trained on sparse labels to generate\npseudo labels and associated confidence maps from abundant unlabeled surgical\nvideos. However, existing TSL methods are confined to image-level supervision,\nproviding only spatial confidence and lacking temporal consistency estimation.\nThis absence of spatio-temporal reliability results in unstable disparity\npredictions and severe flickering artifacts across video frames. To overcome\nthese challenges, we propose TiS-TSL, a novel time-switchable teacher-student\nlearning framework for video stereo matching under minimal supervision. At its\ncore is a unified model that operates in three distinct modes: Image-Prediction\n(IP), Forward Video-Prediction (FVP), and Backward Video-Prediction (BVP),\nenabling flexible temporal modeling within a single architecture.

        "summary": "Inspired by how humans reason over discrete objects and their relationships,\nwe explore whether compact object-centric and object-relation representations\ncan form a foundation for multitask robotic manipulation. Most existing robotic\nmultitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and\nbackground cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability.\nIn contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to\nmore structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our\ncontributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained\nbenchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in\nrobotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric\nannotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well\nas instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable\nvisuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based\nframework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding.\nIt uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object\nrepresentations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant\nembeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into\nexecutable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot\nand object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of\nrequired visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together,\nLIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation\nfor advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.",

However, current approaches for robot relative\nlocalization are primarily realized in the form of distributed multi-robot SLAM\nsystems with the same sensor configuration, which are tightly coupled with the\nstate estimation of all robots, limiting both flexibility and accuracy. To this\nend, we fully leverage the high capacity of Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) to\nintegrate multiple sensors, enabling a semi-distributed cross-modal air-ground\nrelative localization framework. In this work, both the UGV and the Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) independently perform SLAM while extracting deep\nlearning-based keypoints and global descriptors, which decouples the relative\nlocalization from the state estimation of all agents. The UGV employs a local\nBundle Adjustment (BA) with LiDAR, camera, and an IMU to rapidly obtain\naccurate relative pose estimates. The BA process adopts sparse keypoint\noptimization and is divided into two stages: First, optimizing camera poses\ninterpolated from LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO), followed by estimating the\nrelative camera poses between the UGV and UAV. Additionally, we implement an\nincremental loop closure detection algorithm using deep learning-based\ndescriptors to maintain and retrieve keyframes efficiently. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method achieves outstanding performance in both\naccuracy and efficiency.

Recently, the integration of flow matching generative\nmodels into image restoration has garnered significant attention, owing to\ntheir powerful prior modeling capabilities. In this work, we incorporate such\ngenerative priors into a Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework based on proximal\nsplitting, where the proximal operator associated with the regularizer is\nreplaced by a time-dependent denoiser derived from the generative model. While\nexisting PnP methods have achieved notable success in inverse problems with\nsmooth squared $\\ell_2$ data fidelity--typically associated with Gaussian\nnoise--their applicability to more general data fidelity terms remains\nunderexplored. To address this, we propose a general and efficient PnP\nalgorithm inspired by the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method. Our\napproach is computationally efficient, memory-friendly, and accommodates a wide\nrange of fidelity terms. In particular, it supports both $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$\nnorm-based losses, enabling robustness to non-Gaussian noise types such as\nPoisson and impulse noise. We validate our method on several image restoration\ntasks, including denoising, super-resolution, deblurring, and inpainting, and\ndemonstrate that $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_2$ fidelity terms outperform the\nconventional squared $\\ell_2$ loss in the presence of non-Gaussian noise.",

Existing methods struggle with stylized avatars due to the lack of\ndiverse multi-style datasets and challenges in maintaining geometric\nconsistency in non-standard textures. To address these limitations, AvatarTex\nintroduces a novel three-stage diffusion-to-GAN pipeline.

Specifically, our three-stage pipeline first\ncompletes missing texture regions via diffusion-based inpainting, refines style\nand structure consistency using GAN-based latent optimization, and enhances\nfine details through diffusion-based repainting. To address the need for a\nstylized texture dataset, we introduce TexHub, a high-resolution collection of\n20,000 multi-style UV textures with precise UV-aligned layouts.

        "summary": "Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a critical requirement for reliable\nautonomous driving, where safety depends on recognizing road obstacles and\nunexpected objects beyond the training distribution. Despite extensive research\non OOD detection in 2D images, direct transfer to 3D LiDAR point clouds has\nbeen proven ineffective. Current LiDAR OOD methods struggle to distinguish rare\nanomalies from common classes, leading to high false-positive rates and\noverconfident errors in safety-critical settings. We propose Relative Energy\nLearning (REL), a simple yet effective framework for OOD detection in LiDAR\npoint clouds. REL leverages the energy gap between positive (in-distribution)\nand negative logits as a relative scoring function, mitigating calibration\nissues in raw energy values and improving robustness across various scenes. To\naddress the absence of OOD samples during training, we propose a lightweight\ndata synthesis strategy called Point Raise, which perturbs existing point\nclouds to generate auxiliary anomalies without altering the inlier semantics.\nEvaluated on SemanticKITTI and the Spotting the Unexpected (STU) benchmark, REL\nconsistently outperforms existing methods by a large margin. Our results\nhighlight that modeling relative energy, combined with simple synthetic\noutliers, provides a principled and scalable solution for reliable OOD\ndetection in open-world autonomous driving.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in extreme image compression have revealed that mapping pixel\ndata into highly compact latent representations can significantly improve\ncoding efficiency. However, most existing methods compress images into 2-D\nlatent spaces via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or Swin Transformers,\nwhich tend to retain substantial spatial redundancy, thereby limiting overall\ncompression performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Mixed\nRWKV-Transformer (MRT) architecture that encodes images into more compact 1-D\nlatent representations by synergistically integrating the complementary\nstrengths of linear-attention-based RWKV and self-attention-based Transformer\nmodels. Specifically, MRT partitions each image into fixed-size windows,\nutilizing RWKV modules to capture global dependencies across windows and\nTransformer blocks to model local redundancies within each window. The\nhierarchical attention mechanism enables more efficient and compact\nrepresentation learning in the 1-D domain. To further enhance compression\nefficiency, we introduce a dedicated RWKV Compression Model (RCM) tailored to\nthe structure characteristics of the intermediate 1-D latent features in MRT.\nExtensive experiments on standard image compression benchmarks validate the\neffectiveness of our approach. The proposed MRT framework consistently achieves\nsuperior reconstruction quality at bitrates below 0.02 bits per pixel (bpp).\nQuantitative results based on the DISTS metric show that MRT significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art 2-D architecture GLC, achieving bitrate\nsavings of 43.75%, 30.59% on the Kodak and CLIC2020 test datasets,\nrespectively.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a\nlightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as\ntext-guided style transfer.

While recent\napproaches leverage a limited amount of labeled target-domain data to improve\nperformance, the severe imbalance between abundant source data and scarce\ntarget data remains a critical challenge for effective representation learning.\nWe present the first frequency-space perspective to analyze this issue and\nidentify two key challenges: (1) models are easily biased toward\nsource-specific knowledge encoded in the low-frequency components of source\ndata, and (2) the sparsity of target data hinders the learning of\nhigh-frequency, domain-generalizable features. To address these challenges, we\npropose \\textbf{FreqGRL}, a novel CD-FSL framework that mitigates the impact of\ndata imbalance in the frequency space. Specifically, we introduce a\nLow-Frequency Replacement (LFR) module that substitutes the low-frequency\ncomponents of source tasks with those from the target domain to create new\nsource tasks that better align with target characteristics, thus reducing\nsource-specific biases and promoting generalizable representation learning. We\nfurther design a High-Frequency Enhancement (HFE) module that filters out\nlow-frequency components and performs learning directly on high-frequency\nfeatures in the frequency space to improve cross-domain generalization.\nAdditionally, a Global Frequency Filter (GFF) is incorporated to suppress noisy\nor irrelevant frequencies and emphasize informative ones, mitigating\noverfitting risks under limited target supervision. Extensive experiments on\nfive standard CD-FSL benchmarks demonstrate that our frequency-guided framework\nachieves state-of-the-art performance.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we introduce the task of unified anomaly detection and\nclassification, which aims to simultaneously detect anomalous regions in images\nand identify their specific categories. Existing methods typically treat\nanomaly detection and classification as separate tasks, thereby neglecting\ntheir inherent correlation, limiting information sharing, and resulting in\nsuboptimal performance. To address this, we propose UniADC, a unified anomaly\ndetection and classification model that can effectively perform both tasks with\nonly a few or even no anomaly images. Specifically, UniADC consists of two key\ncomponents: a training-free controllable inpainting network and a multi-task\ndiscriminator. The inpainting network can synthesize anomaly images of specific\ncategories by repainting normal regions guided by anomaly priors, and can also\nrepaint few-shot anomaly samples to augment the available anomaly data. The\nmulti-task discriminator is then trained on these synthesized samples, enabling\nprecise anomaly detection and classification by aligning fine-grained image\nfeatures with anomaly-category embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments on\nthree anomaly detection and classification datasets, including MVTec-FS, MTD,\nand WFDD, and the results demonstrate that UniADC consistently outperforms\nexisting methods in anomaly detection, localization, and classification.

        "summary": "Low-dose chest computed tomography (LDCT) inherently captures both pulmonary\nand cardiac structures, offering a unique opportunity for joint assessment of\nlung and cardiovascular health. However, most existing approaches treat these\ndomains as independent tasks, overlooking their physiological interplay and\nshared imaging biomarkers. We propose an Explainable Cross-Disease Reasoning\nFramework that enables interpretable cardiopulmonary risk assessment from a\nsingle LDCT scan. The framework introduces an agentic reasoning process that\nemulates clinical diagnostic thinking-first perceiving pulmonary findings, then\nreasoning through established medical knowledge, and finally deriving a\ncardiovascular judgment with explanatory rationale. It integrates three\nsynergistic components: a pulmonary perception module that summarizes lung\nabnormalities, a knowledge-guided reasoning module that infers their\ncardiovascular implications, and a cardiac representation module that encodes\nstructural biomarkers. Their outputs are fused to produce a holistic\ncardiovascular risk prediction that is both accurate and physiologically\ngrounded. Experiments on the NLST cohort demonstrate that the proposed\nframework achieves state-of-the-art performance for CVD screening and mortality\nprediction, outperforming single-disease and purely image-based baselines.\nBeyond quantitative gains, the framework provides human-verifiable reasoning\nthat aligns with cardiological understanding, revealing coherent links between\npulmonary abnormalities and cardiac stress mechanisms. Overall, this work\nestablishes a unified and explainable paradigm for cardiovascular analysis from\nLDCT, bridging the gap between image-based prediction and mechanism-based\nmedical interpretation.",

Previous\ndeep learning-based MMIF methods generally adopt Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) or Transformers for feature extraction. However, these methods deliver\nunsatisfactory performances due to the limited receptive field of CNNs and the\nhigh computational cost of Transformers. Recently, Mamba has demonstrated a\npowerful potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity,\nproviding a promising solution to MMIF. Unfortunately, Mamba lacks full spatial\nand frequency perceptions, which are very important for MMIF. Moreover,\nemploying Image Reconstruction (IR) as an auxiliary task has been proven\nbeneficial for MMIF. However, a primary challenge is how to leverage IR\nefficiently and effectively. To address the above issues, we propose a novel\nframework named Spatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Fusion (SFMFusion) for MMIF.\nMore specifically, we first propose a three-branch structure to couple MMIF and\nIR, which can retain complete contents from source images. Then, we propose the\nSpatial-Frequency Enhanced Mamba Block (SFMB), which can enhance Mamba in both\nspatial and frequency domains for comprehensive feature extraction.

This paper proposes a novel\nself-contained low-rank approach to automatically rank multiple candidate\ncaptions generated by multiple VLMs based on their hallucination levels, using\nonly the captions themselves without requiring external references or model\naccess. By constructing a sentence-embedding matrix and decomposing it into a\nlow-rank consensus component and a sparse residual, we use the residual\nmagnitude to rank captions: selecting the one with the smallest residual as the\nmost hallucination-free. Experiments on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that\nour approach achieves 87% selection accuracy in identifying hallucination-free\ncaptions, representing a 19% improvement over the unfiltered baseline and a\n6-10% improvement over multi-agent debate method. The sorting produced by\nsparse error magnitudes shows strong correlation with human judgments of\nhallucinations, validating our scoring mechanism.

It spans tasks from\nfoundational recognition and detection to high-level character reasoning and\nnarrative construction, supported by dense annotations for characters, poses,\nand depth. Beyond that, we evaluate state-of-the-art proprietary models,\nincluding GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5, and open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL,\nrevealing substantial performance deficits across core tasks of our benchmarks\nand underscoring that comic understanding remains an unsolved challenge. To\nenhance VLMs' capabilities in this domain, we systematically investigate\npost-training strategies, including supervised fine-tuning on solutions\n(SFT-S), supervised fine-tuning on reasoning trajectories (SFT-R), and\nreinforcement learning (RL). Beyond that, inspired by the emerging \"Thinking\nwith Images\" paradigm, we propose Region-Aware Reinforcement Learning (RARL)\nfor VLMs, which trains models to dynamically attend to relevant regions through\nzoom-in operations.
