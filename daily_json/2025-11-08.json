        "summary": "Humanoid robots are expected to operate in human-centered environments where\nsafe and natural physical interaction is essential. However, most recent\nreinforcement learning (RL) policies emphasize rigid tracking and suppress\nexternal forces. Existing impedance-augmented approaches are typically\nrestricted to base or end-effector control and focus on resisting extreme\nforces rather than enabling compliance. We introduce GentleHumanoid, a\nframework that integrates impedance control into a whole-body motion tracking\npolicy to achieve upper-body compliance. At its core is a unified spring-based\nformulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing\nagainst surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human\nmotion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across\nthe shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse\ninteraction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable\nforce thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,\nincluding gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object\nmanipulation. Compared to baselines, our policy consistently reduces peak\ncontact forces while maintaining task success, resulting in smoother and more\nnatural interactions. These results highlight a step toward humanoid robots\nthat can safely and effectively collaborate with humans and handle objects in\nreal-world environments.",

        "summary": "Human videos can be recorded quickly and at scale, making them an appealing\nsource of training data for robot learning. However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels. Our experiments show that naive co-training under\nexecution mismatches degrades policy performance, while X-Diffusion\nconsistently improves it. Across five manipulation tasks, X-Diffusion achieves\na 16% higher average success rate than the best baseline. The project website\nis available at https://portal-cornell.github.io/X-Diffusion/.",

        "summary": "We argue that progress in true multimodal intelligence calls for a shift from\nreactive, task-driven systems and brute-force long context towards a broader\nparadigm of supersensing. We frame spatial supersensing as four stages beyond\nlinguistic-only understanding: semantic perception (naming what is seen),\nstreaming event cognition (maintaining memory across continuous experiences),\nimplicit 3D spatial cognition (inferring the world behind pixels), and\npredictive world modeling (creating internal models that filter and organize\ninformation). Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering\nnarrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that\nrequire true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we\npresent VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial\nrecall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting). These tasks require\narbitrarily long video inputs yet are resistant to brute-force context\nexpansion. We then test data scaling limits by curating VSI-590K and training\nCambrian-S, achieving +30% absolute improvement on VSI-Bench without\nsacrificing general capabilities. Yet performance on VSI-SUPER remains limited,\nindicating that scale alone is insufficient for spatial supersensing. We\npropose predictive sensing as a path forward, presenting a proof-of-concept in\nwhich a self-supervised next-latent-frame predictor leverages surprise\n(prediction error) to drive memory and event segmentation. On VSI-SUPER, this\napproach substantially outperforms leading proprietary baselines, showing that\nspatial supersensing requires models that not only see but also anticipate,\nselect, and organize experience.",

        "summary": "Robust benchmarks are crucial for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs). Yet we find that models can ace many multimodal benchmarks without\nstrong visual understanding, instead exploiting biases, linguistic priors, and\nsuperficial patterns. This is especially problematic for vision-centric\nbenchmarks that are meant to require visual inputs. We adopt a diagnostic\nprinciple for benchmark design: if a benchmark can be gamed, it will be.\nDesigners should therefore try to ``game'' their own benchmarks first, using\ndiagnostic and debiasing procedures to systematically identify and mitigate\nnon-visual biases. Effective diagnosis requires directly ``training on the test\nset'' -- probing the released test set for its intrinsic, exploitable patterns.\n  We operationalize this standard with two components. First, we diagnose\nbenchmark susceptibility using a ``Test-set Stress-Test'' (TsT) methodology.\nOur primary diagnostic tool involves fine-tuning a powerful Large Language\nModel via $k$-fold cross-validation on exclusively the non-visual, textual\ninputs of the test set to reveal shortcut performance and assign each sample a\nbias score $s(x)$. We complement this with a lightweight Random Forest-based\ndiagnostic operating on hand-crafted features for fast, interpretable auditing.\nSecond, we debias benchmarks by filtering high-bias samples using an\n``Iterative Bias Pruning'' (IBP) procedure. Applying this framework to four\nbenchmarks -- VSI-Bench, CV-Bench, MMMU, and VideoMME -- we uncover pervasive\nnon-visual biases. As a case study, we apply our full framework to create\nVSI-Bench-Debiased, demonstrating reduced non-visual solvability and a wider\nvision-blind performance gap than the original.",

Here, we introduce an\nautomated and accuracy grounded framework to determine image quality across\nsixteen paired or unpaired image translation models. Using color deconvolution,\nwe generate masks of pixels stained brown (i.e., IHC-positive) as predicted by\neach virtual IHC model.

Our results demonstrate that conventional image fidelity metrics,\nincluding Frechet Inception Distance (FID), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR),\nand structural similarity (SSIM), correlate poorly with stain accuracy and\npathologist assessment. Paired models such as PyramidPix2Pix and AdaptiveNCE\nachieve the highest stain accuracy, whereas unpaired diffusion- and GAN-based\nmodels are less reliable in providing accurate IHC positive pixel labels.\nMoreover, whole-slide images (WSI) reveal performance declines that are\ninvisible in patch-based evaluations, emphasizing the need for WSI-level\nbenchmarks.
