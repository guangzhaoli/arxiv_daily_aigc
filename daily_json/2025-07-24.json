        "summary": "Diffusion models produce realistic images and videos but require substantial\ncomputational resources, necessitating multi-accelerator parallelism for\nreal-time deployment. However, parallel inference introduces significant\ncommunication overhead from exchanging large activations between devices,\nlimiting efficiency and scalability. We present CompactFusion, a compression\nframework that significantly reduces communication while preserving generation\nquality. Our key observation is that diffusion activations exhibit strong\ntemporal redundancy-adjacent steps produce highly similar activations,\nsaturating bandwidth with near-duplicate data carrying little new information.\nTo address this inefficiency, we seek a more compact representation that\nencodes only the essential information. CompactFusion achieves this via\nResidual Compression that transmits only compressed residuals (step-wise\nactivation differences). Based on empirical analysis and theoretical\njustification, we show that it effectively removes redundant data, enabling\nsubstantial data reduction while maintaining high fidelity. We also integrate\nlightweight error feedback to prevent error accumulation. CompactFusion\nestablishes a new paradigm for parallel diffusion inference, delivering lower\nlatency and significantly higher generation quality than prior methods. On\n4xL20, it achieves 3.0x speedup while greatly improving fidelity. It also\nuniquely supports communication-heavy strategies like sequence parallelism on\nslow networks, achieving 6.7x speedup over prior overlap-based method.\nCompactFusion applies broadly across diffusion models and parallel settings,\nand integrates easily without requiring pipeline rework.

        "summary": "Robot imitation learning relies on 4D multi-view sequential images. However,\nthe high cost of data collection and the scarcity of high-quality data severely\nconstrain the generalization and application of embodied intelligence policies\nlike Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Data augmentation is a powerful\nstrategy to overcome data scarcity, but methods for editing 4D multi-view\nsequential images for manipulation tasks are currently lacking. Thus, we\npropose ERMV (Editing Robotic Multi-View 4D data), a novel data augmentation\nframework that efficiently edits an entire multi-view sequence based on\nsingle-frame editing and robot state conditions. This task presents three core\nchallenges: (1) maintaining geometric and appearance consistency across dynamic\nviews and long time horizons; (2) expanding the working window with low\ncomputational costs; and (3) ensuring the semantic integrity of critical\nobjects like the robot arm. ERMV addresses these challenges through a series of\ninnovations. First, to ensure spatio-temporal consistency in motion blur, we\nintroduce a novel Epipolar Motion-Aware Attention (EMA-Attn) mechanism that\nlearns pixel shift caused by movement before applying geometric constraints.\nSecond, to maximize the editing working window, ERMV pioneers a Sparse\nSpatio-Temporal (STT) module, which decouples the temporal and spatial views\nand remodels a single-frame multi-view problem through sparse sampling of the\nviews to reduce computational demands. Third, to alleviate error accumulation,\nwe incorporate a feedback intervention Mechanism, which uses a Multimodal Large\nLanguage Model (MLLM) to check editing inconsistencies and request targeted\nexpert guidance only when necessary. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nERMV-augmented data significantly boosts the robustness and generalization of\nVLA models in both simulated and real-world environments.",

Traditional methods often struggle with\nsubstantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,\nthereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these\nconstraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages\npre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring\nfine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of\nMLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity\nand linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To\ncapitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)\nmechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative\nhidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.\nThen a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently\ndetects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate\nexplanations.

        "summary": "Multimodal representation learning seeks to create a unified representation\nspace by integrating diverse data modalities to improve multimodal\nunderstanding. Traditional methods often depend on pairwise contrastive\nlearning, which relies on a predefined anchor modality, restricting alignment\nacross all modalities. Recent advances have investigated the simultaneous\nalignment of multiple modalities, yet several challenges remain, such as\nlimitations imposed by fixed anchor points and instability arising from\noptimizing the product of singular values. To address the challenges, in this\npaper, we propose Principled Multimodal Representation Learning (PMRL), a novel\nframework that achieves simultaneous alignment of multiple modalities without\nanchor dependency in a more stable manner. Specifically, grounded in the\ntheoretical insight that full alignment corresponds to a rank-1 Gram matrix,\nPMRL optimizes the dominant singular value of the representation matrix to\nalign modalities along a shared leading direction. We propose a softmax-based\nloss function that treats singular values as logits to prioritize the largest\nsingular value. Besides, instance-wise contrastive regularization on the\nleading eigenvectors maintains inter-instance separability and prevents\nrepresentation collapse. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate\nPMRL's superiority compared to baseline methods. The source code will be\npublicly available.",

Our method leverages the\ncompact VecSet representation to efficiently generate a coarse object layout in\nthe first stage, reducing token count and accelerating voxel coordinate\nprediction.

        "summary": "State-of-the-art visual under-canopy navigation methods are designed with\ndeep learning-based perception models to distinguish traversable space from\ncrop rows. While these models have demonstrated successful performance, they\nrequire large amounts of training data to ensure reliability in real-world\nfield deployment. However, data collection is costly, demanding significant\nhuman resources for in-field sampling and annotation. To address this\nchallenge, various data augmentation techniques are commonly employed during\nmodel training, such as color jittering, Gaussian blur, and horizontal flip, to\ndiversify training data and enhance model robustness. In this paper, we\nhypothesize that utilizing only these augmentation techniques may lead to\nsuboptimal performance, particularly in complex under-canopy environments with\nfrequent occlusions, debris, and non-uniform spacing of crops. Instead, we\npropose a novel augmentation method, so-called Crop-Aligned Cutout (CA-Cut)\nwhich masks random regions out in input images that are spatially distributed\naround crop rows on the sides to encourage trained models to capture high-level\ncontextual features even when fine-grained information is obstructed. Our\nextensive experiments with a public cornfield dataset demonstrate that\nmasking-based augmentations are effective for simulating occlusions and\nsignificantly improving robustness in semantic keypoint predictions for visual\nnavigation.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are growingly extended to process multimodal\ndata such as text and video simultaneously. Their remarkable performance in\nunderstanding what is shown in images is surpassing specialized neural networks\n(NNs) such as Yolo that is supporting only a well-formed but very limited\nvocabulary, ie., objects that they are able to detect. When being\nnon-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models\n(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.\nThis is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception\nsystems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case\nsituation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to\neither potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who\nare present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in\nreality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving\nsystems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous\ndecisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the\nperformance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic\nsituations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for\ncapturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems. We observe\nthat both, proprietary and open VLMs exhibit remarkable image understanding\ncapabilities even paying thorough attention to fine details sometimes difficult\nto spot for us humans. However, they are also still prone to making up elements\nin their descriptions to date requiring hallucination detection strategies such\nas BetterCheck that we propose in our work.",

        "summary": "Myocardial motion tracking is important for assessing cardiac function and\ndiagnosing cardiovascular diseases, for which cine cardiac magnetic resonance\n(CMR) has been established as the gold standard imaging modality. Many existing\nmethods learn motion from single image pairs consisting of a reference frame\nand a randomly selected target frame from the cardiac cycle. However, these\nmethods overlook the continuous nature of cardiac motion and often yield\ninconsistent and non-smooth motion estimations. In this work, we propose a\nnovel Mamba-based cardiac motion tracking network (MCM) that explicitly\nincorporates target image sequence from the cardiac cycle to achieve smooth and\ntemporally consistent motion tracking. By developing a bi-directional Mamba\nblock equipped with a bi-directional scanning mechanism, our method facilitates\nthe estimation of plausible deformation fields. With our proposed motion\ndecoder that integrates motion information from frames adjacent to the target\nframe, our method further enhances temporal coherence. Moreover, by taking\nadvantage of Mamba's structured state-space formulation, the proposed method\nlearns the continuous dynamics of the myocardium from sequential images without\nincreasing computational complexity. We evaluate the proposed method on two\npublic datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\nquantitatively and qualitatively outperforms both conventional and\nstate-of-the-art learning-based cardiac motion tracking methods.

Inspired by the principle of seeing both the\nforest and trees, we propose Synergos-VQA, a novel synergistic reasoning\nframework. At its core, Synergos-VQA concurrently generates and fuses three\ncomplementary evidence streams at inference time: (1) Holistic Evidence to\nperceive the entire scene (the \"forest\"), (2) Structural Evidence from a\nprototype-driven module to identify key objects (the \"trees\"), and (3) Causal\nEvidence from a counterfactual probe to ensure the reasoning is robustly\ngrounded.

Extensive\nexperiments show that Synergos-VQA decisively establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art on three challenging benchmarks, including OK-VQA and A-OKVQA.\nFurthermore, our approach demonstrates strong plug-and-play capabilities,\nsignificantly boosting various open-source MLLMs and proving that superior\nmethodological design can outperform sheer model scale.",

Our main observation is that tokens corresponding to\nsemantically similar regions form a set of metastable states, where the\nattention clusters, while noisy attention scores tend to disperse. Metastable\nstates and their prevalence can be easily computed through simple matrix\nmultiplication and eigenanalysis, respectively.

        "summary": "An important challenge when using computer vision models in the real world is\nto evaluate their performance in potential out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.\nWhile simple synthetic corruptions are commonly applied to test OOD robustness,\nthey often fail to capture nuisance shifts that occur in the real world.\nRecently, diffusion models have been applied to generate realistic images for\nbenchmarking, but they are restricted to binary nuisance shifts. In this work,\nwe introduce CNS-Bench, a Continuous Nuisance Shift Benchmark to quantify OOD\nrobustness of image classifiers for continuous and realistic generative\nnuisance shifts. CNS-Bench allows generating a wide range of individual\nnuisance shifts in continuous severities by applying LoRA adapters to diffusion\nmodels. To address failure cases, we propose a filtering mechanism that\noutperforms previous methods, thereby enabling reliable benchmarking with\ngenerative models. With the proposed benchmark, we perform a large-scale study\nto evaluate the robustness of more than 40 classifiers under various nuisance\nshifts. Through carefully designed comparisons and analyses, we find that model\nrankings can change for varying shifts and shift scales, which cannot be\ncaptured when applying common binary shifts. Additionally, we show that\nevaluating the model performance on a continuous scale allows the\nidentification of model failure points, providing a more nuanced understanding\nof model robustness.

We conducted an eye-tracking experiment with 30\nparticipants (9 female, 21 male, mean age 24.6 years) who viewed 20 artisanal\nobjects comprising basketry bags and ginger jars. Using a Pupil Labs\neye-tracker, we recorded gaze patterns and generated heat maps representing\nhuman visual attention. Simultaneously, we analyzed the same objects using a\npre-trained ViT model with DINO (Self-DIstillation with NO Labels), extracting\nattention maps from each of the 12 attention heads. We compared human and ViT\nattention distributions using Kullback-Leibler divergence across varying\nGaussian parameters (sigma=0.1 to 3.0). Statistical analysis revealed optimal\ncorrelation at sigma=2.4 +-0.03, with attention head #12 showing the strongest\nalignment with human visual patterns. Significant differences were found\nbetween attention heads, with heads #7 and #9 demonstrating the greatest\ndivergence from human attention (p< 0.05, Tukey HSD test). Results indicate\nthat while ViTs exhibit more global attention patterns compared to human focal\nattention, certain attention heads can approximate human visual behavior,\nparticularly for specific object features like buckles in basketry items. These\nfindings suggest potential applications of ViT attention mechanisms in product\ndesign and aesthetic evaluation, while highlighting fundamental differences in\nattention strategies between human perception and current AI models.",

Conventional\ninverse graphics methods rely primarily on RGB observations and use LiDAR\nmainly for geometric information, often resulting in suboptimal material\nestimates due to visible light interference. We find that LiDAR's intensity\nvalues-captured with active illumination in a different spectral range-offer\ncomplementary cues for robust material estimation under variable lighting.\nInspired by this, InvRGB+L leverages LiDAR intensity cues to overcome\nchallenges inherent in RGB-centric inverse graphics through two key\ninnovations: (1) a novel physics-based LiDAR shading model and (2) RGB-LiDAR\nmaterial consistency losses. The model produces novel-view RGB and LiDAR\nrenderings of urban and indoor scenes and supports relighting, night\nsimulations, and dynamic object insertions, achieving results that surpass\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods in both scene-level urban inverse rendering\nand LiDAR simulation.",

To address these issues, we propose\nD2P-MMT, a diffusion-based dual-branch prompting framework for robust\nvision-guided translation. Specifically, D2P-MMT requires only the source text\nand a reconstructed image generated by a pre-trained diffusion model, which\nnaturally filters out distracting visual details while preserving semantic\ncues. During training, the model jointly learns from both authentic and\nreconstructed images using a dual-branch prompting strategy, encouraging rich\ncross-modal interactions. To bridge the modality gap and mitigate\ntraining-inference discrepancies, we introduce a distributional alignment loss\nthat enforces consistency between the output distributions of the two branches.\nExtensive experiments on the Multi30K dataset demonstrate that D2P-MMT achieves\nsuperior translation performance compared to existing state-of-the-art\napproaches.",

This concerning issue has\nrenewed the efforts in developing protection mechanisms based on adversarial\nattacks, which generate effective perturbations to poison diffusion models. Our\nwork is motivated by the observation that these models exhibit a high degree of\nabstraction within their semantic latent space (`h-space'), which encodes\ncritical high-level features for generating coherent and meaningful content. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel anti-customization approach, called HAAD\n(h-space based Adversarial Attack for Diffusion models), that leverages\nadversarial attacks to craft perturbations based on the h-space that can\nefficiently degrade the image generation process. Building upon HAAD, we\nfurther introduce a more efficient variant, HAAD-KV, that constructs\nperturbations solely based on the KV parameters of the h-space.

However, they face critical challenges in\nspecialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of\nannotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which\nhinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,\nan ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning\ncapabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the\nintelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and\nleverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease\nclassification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis\nwithin a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically\naligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable\nreasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen,\nachieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,\nsurpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in\nzero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,\nsignificantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling\nlaw between data quality and model capability ($L \\propto N^{0.068}$),\ndemonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance\ndata utilization efficiency.

This limitation prevents\nthe models from obtaining the abundant information provided by other relevant\ntasks, which can hinder their performance in downstream tasks, particularly in\ncomplex and diverse domains. In order to tackle this issue, we propose MMPT, a\nMulti-modal Multi-task Pre-training framework designed to enhance point cloud\nunderstanding. Specifically, three pre-training tasks are devised: (i)\nToken-level reconstruction (TLR) aims to recover masked point tokens, endowing\nthe model with representative learning abilities. (ii) Point-level\nreconstruction (PLR) is integrated to predict the masked point positions\ndirectly, and the reconstructed point cloud can be considered as a transformed\npoint cloud used in the subsequent task. (iii) Multi-modal contrastive learning\n(MCL) combines feature correspondences within and across modalities, thus\nassembling a rich learning signal from both 3D point cloud and 2D image\nmodalities in a self-supervised manner. Moreover, this framework operates\nwithout requiring any 3D annotations, making it scalable for use with large\ndatasets.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce InstructVLA, an end-to-end VLA model that preserves the flexible\nreasoning of large vision-language models (VLMs) while delivering leading\nmanipulation performance.

        "summary": "Strong light sources in nighttime photography frequently produce flares in\nimages, significantly degrading visual quality and impacting the performance of\ndownstream tasks. While some progress has been made, existing methods continue\nto struggle with removing large-scale flare artifacts and repairing structural\ndamage in regions near the light source. We observe that these challenging\nflare artifacts exhibit more significant discrepancies from the reference\nimages in the frequency domain compared to the spatial domain. Therefore, this\npaper presents a novel dynamic frequency-guided deflare network (DFDNet) that\ndecouples content information from flare artifacts in the frequency domain,\neffectively removing large-scale flare artifacts. Specifically, DFDNet consists\nmainly of a global dynamic frequency-domain guidance (GDFG) module and a local\ndetail guidance module (LDGM). The GDFG module guides the network to perceive\nthe frequency characteristics of flare artifacts by dynamically optimizing\nglobal frequency domain features, effectively separating flare information from\ncontent information. Additionally, we design an LDGM via a contrastive learning\nstrategy that aligns the local features of the light source with the reference\nimage, reduces local detail damage from flare removal, and improves\nfine-grained image restoration. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of\nperformance.

Beyond\nreporting performance metrics, we aim to interpret what these results reveal\nabout the underlying possibilities and limitations of the VE task. We conduct a\nseries of experiments across zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings,\nexploring how factors such as prompt design, the number and order of in-context\nexamples and access to visual information might affect VE performance. To\nfurther probe the reasoning processes of the model, we used explanation-based\nevaluations. Results indicate that three-shot inference outperforms the\nzero-shot baselines. However, additional examples introduce more noise than\nthey provide benefits. Additionally, the order of the labels in the prompt is a\ncritical factor that influences the predictions. In the absence of visual\ninformation, the model has a strong tendency to hallucinate and imagine\ncontent, raising questions about the model's over-reliance on linguistic\npriors. Fine-tuning yields strong results, achieving an accuracy of 83.3% on\nthe e-SNLI-VE dataset and outperforming the state-of-the-art OFA-X model.\nAdditionally, the explanation evaluation demonstrates that the fine-tuned model\nprovides semantically meaningful explanations similar to those of humans, with\na BERTScore F1-score of 89.2%. We do, however, find comparable BERTScore\nresults in experiments with limited vision, questioning the visual grounding of\nthis task.

Existing HOI methods rely\nheavily on large datasets with manual annotations to learn interactions from\nvisual cues.

We\nargue that recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer untapped\npotential, particularly in enhancing interaction representation. While prior\nwork has injected such potential and even proposed training-free methods, there\nremain key gaps. Consequently, we propose a novel training-free HOI detection\nframework for Dynamic Scoring with enhanced semantics (DYSCO) that effectively\nutilizes textual and visual interaction representations within a multimodal\nregistry, enabling robust and nuanced interaction understanding. This registry\nincorporates a small set of visual cues and uses innovative interaction\nsignatures to improve the semantic alignment of verbs, facilitating effective\ngeneralization to rare interactions.

Building on prior studies for tumor\ncharacterization via CBIR, this study advances CBIR research for volumetric\nmedical images through three key contributions: (1) a framework eliminating\nreliance on pre-segmented data and organ-specific datasets, aligning with large\nand unstructured image archiving systems, i.e. PACS in clinical practice; (2)\nintroduction of C-MIR, a novel volumetric re-ranking method adapting ColBERT's\ncontextualized late interaction mechanism for 3D medical imaging; (3)\ncomprehensive evaluation across four tumor sites using three feature extractors\nand three database configurations. Our evaluations highlight the significant\nadvantages of C-MIR. We demonstrate the successful adaptation of the late\ninteraction principle to volumetric medical images, enabling effective\ncontext-aware re-ranking. A key finding is C-MIR's ability to effectively\nlocalize the region of interest, eliminating the need for pre-segmentation of\ndatasets and offering a computationally efficient alternative to systems\nrelying on expensive data enrichment steps. C-MIR demonstrates promising\nimprovements in tumor flagging, achieving improved performance, particularly\nfor colon and lung tumors (p<0.05).

Traditional approaches primarily focus on disentangling\nattributes and objects, treating them as independent entities during learning.\nHowever, this assumption overlooks the semantic constraints and contextual\ndependencies inside a composition. For example, certain attributes naturally\npair with specific objects (e.g., \"striped\" applies to \"zebra\" or \"shirts\" but\nnot \"sky\" or \"water\"), while the same attribute can manifest differently\ndepending on context (e.g., \"young\" in \"young tree\" vs. \"young dog\"). Thus,\ncapturing attribute-object interdependence remains a fundamental yet\nlong-ignored challenge in CZSL. In this paper, we adopt a Conditional\nProbability Framework (CPF) to explicitly model attribute-object dependencies.\nWe decompose the probability of a composition into two components: the\nlikelihood of an object and the conditional likelihood of its attribute. To\nenhance object feature learning, we incorporate textual descriptors to\nhighlight semantically relevant image regions. These enhanced object features\nthen guide attribute learning through a cross-attention mechanism, ensuring\nbetter contextual alignment. By jointly optimizing object likelihood and\nconditional attribute likelihood, our method effectively captures compositional\ndependencies and generalizes well to unseen compositions.

        "title": "PARTE: Part-Guided Texturing for 3D Human Reconstruction from a Single Image",
        "summary": "The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main\nlimitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such\nas a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into\nothers. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to\ninfer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most\nexisting 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part\nsegmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions.\nIn this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a\nkey guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core\ncomponents. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we\npropose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially\nreconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based\non the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into\ntexture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module\n(PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image\ngeneration network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human\nreconstruction. The project page is available at\nhttps://hygenie1228.github.io/PARTE/.",

        "summary": "With the rapid advancement of large foundation models, AIGC, cloud rendering,\nand real-time motion capture technologies, digital humans are now capable of\nachieving synchronized facial expressions and body movements, engaging in\nintelligent dialogues driven by natural language, and enabling the fast\ncreation of personalized avatars. While current mainstream approaches to\ndigital humans primarily focus on 3D models and 2D video-based representations,\ninteractive 2D cartoon-style digital humans have received relatively less\nattention. Compared to 3D digital humans that require complex modeling and high\nrendering costs, and 2D video-based solutions that lack flexibility and\nreal-time interactivity, 2D cartoon-style Live2D models offer a more efficient\nand expressive alternative. By simulating 3D-like motion through layered\nsegmentation without the need for traditional 3D modeling, Live2D enables\ndynamic and real-time manipulation. In this technical report, we present\nCartoonAlive, an innovative method for generating high-quality Live2D digital\nhumans from a single input portrait image. CartoonAlive leverages the shape\nbasis concept commonly used in 3D face modeling to construct facial blendshapes\nsuitable for Live2D. It then infers the corresponding blendshape weights based\non facial keypoints detected from the input image. This approach allows for the\nrapid generation of a highly expressive and visually accurate Live2D model that\nclosely resembles the input portrait, within less than half a minute. Our work\nprovides a practical and scalable solution for creating interactive 2D cartoon\ncharacters, opening new possibilities in digital content creation and virtual\ncharacter animation.

        "summary": "Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical\nimage segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in\ncross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First,\nthe segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated\nprompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image\nsegmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second,\nproviding poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large)\nto the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask\nresults. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain\ngeneralization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully\nautomated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted\nGeneration Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty\nModeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module\nintegrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty\ndistribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding\nbox prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with\nSAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image\nembeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the\ntarget object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive\nexperiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate\nthe effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above\nchallenges.",

State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via\nvision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised\npre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to\nboost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models\nexclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to\nlearn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training,\naiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data\nfor foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a\nsynergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training\nframework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge\nin combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model\nlies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data.\nTo address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the\nCLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic\nspecific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for\nsemantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation\nloss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature\nspace back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space.

To\naddress this limitation, a multi-level visual representation paradigm is\nproposed with three stages, namely multi-level feature extraction, hierarchical\nfusion, and joint aggregation. Based on this paradigm, two networks are\ndeveloped. Specifically, the Multi-Level Global-Local Fusion Network (MGLF-Net)\nis designed for the perceptual quality assessment, extracting complementary\nlocal and global features via dual CNN and Transformer visual backbones. The\nMulti-Level Prompt-Embedded Fusion Network (MPEF-Net) targets Text-to-Image\ncorrespondence by embedding prompt semantics into the visual feature fusion\nprocess at each feature level. The fused multi-level features are then\naggregated for final evaluation.

        "summary": "Ocular biometrics in the visible spectrum have emerged as a prominent\nmodality due to their high accuracy, resistance to spoofing, and non-invasive\nnature. However, morphing attacks, synthetic biometric traits created by\nblending features from multiple individuals, threaten biometric system\nintegrity. While extensively studied for near-infrared iris and face\nbiometrics, morphing in visible-spectrum ocular data remains underexplored.\nSimulating such attacks demands advanced generation models that handle\nuncontrolled conditions while preserving detailed ocular features like iris\nboundaries and periocular textures. To address this gap, we introduce DOOMGAN,\nthat encompasses landmark-driven encoding of visible ocular anatomy,\nattention-guided generation for realistic morph synthesis, and dynamic\nweighting of multi-faceted losses for optimized convergence. DOOMGAN achieves\nover 20% higher attack success rates than baseline methods under stringent\nthresholds, along with 20% better elliptical iris structure generation and 30%\nimproved gaze consistency. We also release the first comprehensive ocular\nmorphing dataset to support further research in this domain.",

        "summary": "Existing image contrast enhancement methods are typically designed for\nspecific tasks such as under-/over-exposure correction, low-light and backlit\nimage enhancement, etc. The learned models, however, exhibit poor\ngeneralization performance across different tasks, even across different\ndatasets of a specific task. It is important to explore whether we can learn a\nuniversal and generalized model for various contrast enhancement tasks. In this\nwork, we observe that the common key factor of these tasks lies in the need of\nexposure and contrast adjustment, which can be well-addressed if high-dynamic\nrange (HDR) inputs are available. We hence collect 46,928 HDR raw images from\npublic sources, and render 328,496 sRGB images to build multi-exposure\nsequences (MES) and the corresponding pseudo sRGB ground-truths via\nmulti-exposure fusion. Consequently, we train a network to generate an MES from\na single sRGB image, followed by training another network to fuse the generated\nMES into an enhanced image. Our proposed method, namely UNiversal Image\nContrast Enhancer (UNICE), is free of costly human labeling. However, it\ndemonstrates significantly stronger generalization performance than existing\nimage contrast enhancement methods across and within different tasks, even\noutperforming manually created ground-truths in multiple no-reference image\nquality metrics.

        "summary": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative tasks but\nsuffer from high computational costs due to their iterative sampling process\nand quadratic attention costs. Existing training-free acceleration strategies\nthat reduce per-step computation cost, while effectively reducing sampling\ntime, demonstrate low faithfulness compared to the original baseline. We\nhypothesize that this fidelity gap arises because (a) different prompts\ncorrespond to varying denoising trajectory, and (b) such methods do not\nconsider the underlying ODE formulation and its numerical solution. In this\npaper, we propose Stability-guided Adaptive Diffusion Acceleration (SADA), a\nnovel paradigm that unifies step-wise and token-wise sparsity decisions via a\nsingle stability criterion to accelerate sampling of ODE-based generative\nmodels (Diffusion and Flow-matching). For (a), SADA adaptively allocates\nsparsity based on the sampling trajectory. For (b), SADA introduces principled\napproximation schemes that leverage the precise gradient information from the\nnumerical ODE solver. Comprehensive evaluations on SD-2, SDXL, and Flux using\nboth EDM and DPM++ solvers reveal consistent $\\ge 1.8\\times$ speedups with\nminimal fidelity degradation (LPIPS $\\leq 0.10$ and FID $\\leq 4.5$) compared to\nunmodified baselines, significantly outperforming prior methods.

        "summary": "Multimodal 3D occupancy prediction has garnered significant attention for its\npotential in autonomous driving. However, most existing approaches are\nsingle-modality: camera-based methods lack depth information, while LiDAR-based\nmethods struggle with occlusions. Current lightweight methods primarily rely on\nthe Lift-Splat-Shoot (LSS) pipeline, which suffers from inaccurate depth\nestimation and fails to fully exploit the geometric and semantic information of\n3D LiDAR points. Therefore, we propose a novel multimodal occupancy prediction\nnetwork called SDG-OCC, which incorporates a joint semantic and depth-guided\nview transformation coupled with a fusion-to-occupancy-driven active\ndistillation. The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth\ndistributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through\ndiffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active\ndistillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and\nselectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified\nregions. Finally, for optimal performance, we introduce SDG-Fusion, which uses\nfusion alone, and SDG-KL, which integrates both fusion and distillation for\nfaster inference. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with\nreal-time processing on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset and shows comparable\nperformance on the more challenging SurroundOcc-nuScenes dataset, demonstrating\nits effectiveness and robustness.

To solve this issue, we rely on the\nprogressive construction of a text-based memory by a video captioner operating\non shorter chunks of the video, where spatio-temporal modeling is\ncomputationally feasible. We explore ways to improve the quality of the\nactivity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video\ncaptions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to\nother information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene\ndescriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding\nsystem relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer\nquestions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the\nvideo into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more\naccurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we\nincorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA\nVLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the\nspace of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we\nhave successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action\nand scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning\npipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks.

        "summary": "We propose StreamME, a method focuses on fast 3D avatar reconstruction. The\nStreamME synchronously records and reconstructs a head avatar from live video\nstreams without any pre-cached data, enabling seamless integration of the\nreconstructed appearance into downstream applications. This exceptionally fast\ntraining strategy, which we refer to as on-the-fly training, is central to our\napproach. Our method is built upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), eliminating\nthe reliance on MLPs in deformable 3DGS and relying solely on geometry, which\nsignificantly improves the adaptation speed to facial expression. To further\nensure high efficiency in on-the-fly training, we introduced a simplification\nstrategy based on primary points, which distributes the point clouds more\nsparsely across the facial surface, optimizing points number while maintaining\nrendering quality. Leveraging the on-the-fly training capabilities, our method\nprotects the facial privacy and reduces communication bandwidth in VR system or\nonline conference. Additionally, it can be directly applied to downstream\napplication such as animation, toonify, and relighting.

In this paper, we\nexplore the effectiveness of augmenting the training data of a handshape\nclassifier by generating synthetic data.

ReACGAN allows for the generation of realistic images that align\nwith specific handshape labels, while SPADE focuses on generating images with\naccurate spatial handshape configurations. Our proposed techniques improve the\ncurrent state-of-the-art accuracy on the RWTH dataset by 5%, addressing the\nlimitations of small and unbalanced datasets.

While compressibility and robustness have each been\nstudied extensively, a unified understanding of their interaction still remains\nelusive. In this work, we develop a principled framework to analyze how\ndifferent forms of compressibility - such as neuron-level sparsity and spectral\ncompressibility - affect adversarial robustness. We show that these forms of\ncompression can induce a small number of highly sensitive directions in the\nrepresentation space, which adversaries can exploit to construct effective\nperturbations. Our analysis yields a simple yet instructive robustness bound,\nrevealing how neuron and spectral compressibility impact $L_\\infty$ and $L_2$\nrobustness via their effects on the learned representations. Crucially, the\nvulnerabilities we identify arise irrespective of how compression is achieved -\nwhether via regularization, architectural bias, or implicit learning dynamics.\nThrough empirical evaluations across synthetic and realistic tasks, we confirm\nour theoretical predictions, and further demonstrate that these vulnerabilities\npersist under adversarial training and transfer learning, and contribute to the\nemergence of universal adversarial perturbations. Our findings show a\nfundamental tension between structured compressibility and robustness, and\nsuggest new pathways for designing models that are both efficient and secure.",

        "summary": "As surgery embraces digital transformation--integrating sophisticated\nimaging, advanced algorithms, and robotics to support and automate complex\nsub-tasks--human judgment of system correctness remains a vital safeguard for\npatient safety. This shift introduces new \"operator-type\" roles tasked with\nverifying complex algorithmic outputs, particularly at critical junctures of\nthe procedure, such as the intermediary check before drilling or implant\nplacement. A prime example is 2D/3D registration, a key enabler of image-based\nsurgical navigation that aligns intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D\ndata. Although registration algorithms have advanced significantly, they\noccasionally yield inaccurate results. Because even small misalignments can\nlead to revision surgery or irreversible surgical errors, there is a critical\nneed for robust quality assurance. Current visualization-based strategies alone\nhave been found insufficient to enable humans to reliably detect 2D/3D\nregistration misalignments. In response, we propose the first artificial\nintelligence (AI) framework trained specifically for 2D/3D registration quality\nverification, augmented by explainability features that clarify the model's\ndecision-making. Our explainable AI (XAI) approach aims to enhance informed\ndecision-making for human operators by providing a second opinion together with\na rationale behind it. Through algorithm-centric and human-centered\nevaluations, we systematically compare four conditions: AI-only, human-only,\nhuman-AI, and human-XAI. Our findings reveal that while explainability features\nmodestly improve user trust and willingness to override AI errors, they do not\nexceed the standalone AI in aggregate performance. Nevertheless, future work\nextending both the algorithmic design and the human-XAI collaboration elements\nholds promise for more robust quality assurance of 2D/3D registration.",

        "summary": "Early and accurate interpretation of screening mammograms is essential for\neffective breast cancer detection, yet it remains a complex challenge due to\nsubtle imaging findings and diagnostic ambiguity. Many existing AI approaches\nfall short by focusing on single view inputs or single-task outputs, limiting\ntheir clinical utility. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\nmulti-view, multitask hybrid deep learning framework that processes all four\nstandard mammography views and jointly predicts diagnostic labels and BI-RADS\nscores for each breast. Our architecture integrates a hybrid CNN VSSM backbone,\ncombining convolutional encoders for rich local feature extraction with Visual\nState Space Models (VSSMs) to capture global contextual dependencies. To\nimprove robustness and interpretability, we incorporate a gated attention-based\nfusion module that dynamically weights information across views, effectively\nhandling cases with missing data. We conduct extensive experiments across\ndiagnostic tasks of varying complexity, benchmarking our proposed hybrid models\nagainst baseline CNN architectures and VSSM models in both single task and\nmulti task learning settings. Across all tasks, the hybrid models consistently\noutperform the baselines. In the binary BI-RADS 1 vs. 5 classification task,\nthe shared hybrid model achieves an AUC of 0.9967 and an F1 score of 0.9830.\nFor the more challenging ternary classification, it attains an F1 score of\n0.7790, while in the five-class BI-RADS task, the best F1 score reaches 0.4904.\nThese results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework and\nunderscore both the potential and limitations of multitask learning for\nimproving diagnostic performance and enabling clinically meaningful mammography\nanalysis.",

        "summary": "The introduction of the neural implicit representation has notably propelled\nthe advancement of online dense reconstruction techniques. Compared to\ntraditional explicit representations, such as TSDF, it improves the mapping\ncompleteness and memory efficiency. However, the lack of reconstruction details\nand the time-consuming learning of neural representations hinder the widespread\napplication of neural-based methods to large-scale online reconstruction. We\nintroduce RemixFusion, a novel residual-based mixed representation for scene\nreconstruction and camera pose estimation dedicated to high-quality and\nlarge-scale online RGB-D reconstruction. In particular, we propose a\nresidual-based map representation comprised of an explicit coarse TSDF grid and\nan implicit neural module that produces residuals representing fine-grained\ndetails to be added to the coarse grid. Such mixed representation allows for\ndetail-rich reconstruction with bounded time and memory budget, contrasting\nwith the overly-smoothed results by the purely implicit representations, thus\npaving the way for high-quality camera tracking. Furthermore, we extend the\nresidual-based representation to handle multi-frame joint pose optimization via\nbundle adjustment (BA). In contrast to the existing methods, which optimize\nposes directly, we opt to optimize pose changes. Combined with a novel\ntechnique for adaptive gradient amplification, our method attains better\noptimization convergence and global optimality. Furthermore, we adopt a local\nmoving volume to factorize the mixed scene representation with a\ndivide-and-conquer design to facilitate efficient online learning in our\nresidual-based framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nsurpasses all state-of-the-art ones, including those based either on explicit\nor implicit representations, in terms of the accuracy of both mapping and\ntracking on large-scale scenes.",

Recent studies have attempted to address this problem by converting\nthe complex 3D spatial scenes into 2D image super-resolution tasks. However,\ndue to the sparse and blurry feature representation of range images, accurately\nreconstructing detailed and complex spatial topologies remains a major\ndifficulty. To tackle this, we propose a novel sparse point cloud upsampling\nmethod named SRMambaV2, which enhances the upsampling accuracy in long-range\nsparse regions while preserving the overall geometric reconstruction quality.\nSpecifically, inspired by human driver visual perception, we design a\nbiomimetic 2D selective scanning self-attention (2DSSA) mechanism to model the\nfeature distribution in distant sparse areas.

We apply this framework to the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC\ndatasets and demonstrate that the inclusion of spatial diversity effectively\nimproves the performance of uncertainty-based and feature diversity-based\nactive learning methods.

Existing methods often rely on single mapping relationships,\noverlooking feature diversity and thereby inducing biased training. Although\nthe Segment Anything Model (SAM) provides rich feature representations, its\napplication to subcellular scenarios is hindered by two key challenges: (1) The\nvariability in subcellular morphology and distribution creates gaps in the\nlabel space, leading the model to learn spurious or biased features. (2) SAM\nfocuses on global contextual understanding and often ignores fine-grained\nspatial details, making it challenging to capture subtle structural alterations\nand cope with skewed data distributions. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ScSAM, a method that enhances feature robustness by fusing\npre-trained SAM with Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-guided cellular prior knowledge\nto alleviate training bias from data imbalance. Specifically, we design a\nfeature alignment and fusion module to align pre-trained embeddings to the same\nfeature space and efficiently combine different representations.

Among these\napplications, the generation and updating of spatial maps of the built\nenvironment have become critical due to the extensive coverage and detailed\nimagery provided by satellites. However, reconstructing spatial maps from\nsatellite imagery is a complex computer vision task, requiring the creation of\nhigh-level object representations, such as primitives, to accurately capture\nthe built environment. While the past decade has witnessed remarkable\nadvancements in object detection and representation using visual data,\nprimitives-based object representation remains a persistent challenge in\ncomputer vision. Consequently, high-quality spatial maps often rely on\nlabor-intensive and manual processes. This paper introduces a novel deep\nlearning methodology leveraging Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) to address\nthese challenges in building footprint reconstruction. The proposed approach\nenhances performance by incorporating geometric regularity into building\nboundaries, integrating multi-scale and multi-resolution features, and\nembedding Attraction Field Maps into the network.

        "title": "Joint Asymmetric Loss for Learning with Noisy Labels",
        "summary": "Learning with noisy labels is a crucial task for training accurate deep\nneural networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various\nrobust loss functions, particularly symmetric losses. Nevertheless, symmetric\nlosses usually suffer from the underfitting issue due to the overly strict\nconstraint. To address this problem, the Active Passive Loss (APL) jointly\noptimizes an active and a passive loss to mutually enhance the overall fitting\nability. Within APL, symmetric losses have been successfully extended, yielding\nadvanced robust loss functions. Despite these advancements, emerging\ntheoretical analyses indicate that asymmetric losses, a new class of robust\nloss functions, possess superior properties compared to symmetric losses.\nHowever, existing asymmetric losses are not compatible with advanced\noptimization frameworks such as APL, limiting their potential and\napplicability. Motivated by this theoretical gap and the prospect of asymmetric\nlosses, we extend the asymmetric loss to the more complex passive loss scenario\nand propose the Asymetric Mean Square Error (AMSE), a novel asymmetric loss. We\nrigorously establish the necessary and sufficient condition under which AMSE\nsatisfies the asymmetric condition. By substituting the traditional symmetric\npassive loss in APL with our proposed AMSE, we introduce a novel robust loss\nframework termed Joint Asymmetric Loss (JAL). Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method in mitigating label noise. Code available at:\nhttps://github.com/cswjl/joint-asymmetric-loss",

One effective approach is to search for the optimal ray direction\nfrom the benign image that minimizes the $\\ell_p$-norm distance to the\nadversarial region. The unique advantage of this approach is that it transforms\nthe hard-label attack into a continuous optimization problem. The objective\nfunction value is the ray's radius, which can be obtained via binary search at\na high query cost. Existing methods use a \"sign trick\" in gradient estimation\nto reduce the number of queries. In this paper, we theoretically analyze the\nquality of this gradient estimation and propose a novel prior-guided approach\nto improve ray search efficiency both theoretically and empirically.\nSpecifically, we utilize the transfer-based priors from surrogate models, and\nour gradient estimators appropriately integrate them by approximating the\nprojection of the true gradient onto the subspace spanned by these priors and\nrandom directions, in a query-efficient manner. We theoretically derive the\nexpected cosine similarities between the obtained gradient estimators and the\ntrue gradient, and demonstrate the improvement achieved by incorporating\npriors.

We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy\nOptimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following (\"player\") and reward\nmodeling (\"referee\") within a single model and a single training phase. Our\nmethod recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable\nreasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format\noptimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This\nenables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic\nwhile simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.\nExperiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified\nmodel significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative\nreward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24\nto 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66.

Traditional retrieval-based methods for\ngeo-localization struggle with scalability and perceptual aliasing, while\nclassification-based approaches lack generalization and require extensive\ntraining data. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) offer a\npromising alternative by leveraging contextual understanding and reasoning.\nHowever, while VLMs achieve high accuracy, they are often prone to\nhallucinations and lack interpretability, making them unreliable as standalone\nsolutions. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid geo-localization framework\nthat combines the strengths of VLMs with retrieval-based visual place\nrecognition (VPR) methods. Our approach first leverages a VLM to generate a\nprior, effectively guiding and constraining the retrieval search space. We then\nemploy a retrieval step, followed by a re-ranking mechanism that selects the\nmost geographically plausible matches based on feature similarity and proximity\nto the initially estimated coordinates. We evaluate our approach on multiple\ngeo-localization benchmarks and show that it consistently outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art methods, particularly at street (up to 4.51%) and city level\n(up to 13.52%).

To tackle these two problems, we introduce MoviCam, the first\nnon-synthetic dataset containing ground-truth camera trajectories of a\ndynamically moving monocular RGB camera, scene geometry, and 3D human motion\nwith human-scene contact labels. Additionally, we propose PhysDynPose, a\nphysics-based method that incorporates scene geometry and physical constraints\nfor more accurate human motion tracking in case of camera motion and non-flat\nscenes. More precisely, we use a state-of-the-art kinematics estimator to\nobtain the human pose and a robust SLAM method to capture the dynamic camera\ntrajectory, enabling the recovery of the human pose in the world frame.

        "summary": "Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain\nto an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data.\nWhile this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source\ndataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption\nthat only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target\ndomain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined\nobjects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object\nDetection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only\nrecognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects.\nTo this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal\nAxis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning\nenhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from\nthe auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained\ndetector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal\naxes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by\nestimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from\nmodel predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its\neffectiveness.",

While this paradigm can produce diverse motion intentions, it\noften falls short in modeling the intricate spatiotemporal evolution of\ntrajectories, which can lead to collisions or suboptimal outcomes. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose DeMo++, a framework that decouples motion\nestimation into two distinct components: holistic motion intentions to capture\nthe diverse potential directions of movement, and fine spatiotemporal states to\ntrack the agent's dynamic progress within the scene and enable a\nself-refinement capability. Further, we introduce a cross-scene trajectory\ninteraction mechanism to explore the relationships between motions in adjacent\nscenes. This allows DeMo++ to comprehensively model both the diversity of\nmotion intentions and the spatiotemporal evolution of each trajectory. To\neffectively implement this framework, we developed a hybrid model combining\nAttention and Mamba. This architecture leverages the strengths of both\nmechanisms for efficient scene information aggregation and precise trajectory\nstate sequence modeling.

Existing methods struggle with\nextracting robust features and suffer from the lack of reliable annotations. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel Temporal Point-Supervised (TPS)\nframework that enables high-performance detection of weak targets without any\nmanual annotations.Instead of conventional frame-based detection, our framework\nreformulates the task as a pixel-wise temporal signal modeling problem, where\nweak targets manifest as short-duration pulse-like responses. A Temporal Signal\nReconstruction Network (TSRNet) is developed under the TPS paradigm to\nreconstruct these transient signals.TSRNet adopts an encoder-decoder\narchitecture and integrates a Dynamic Multi-Scale Attention (DMSAttention)\nmodule to enhance its sensitivity to diverse temporal patterns. Additionally, a\ngraph-based trajectory mining strategy is employed to suppress false alarms and\nensure temporal consistency.Extensive experiments on a purpose-built low-SNR\ndataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nwhile requiring no human annotations.

However, the existing pipeline relies on a global search\nacross the entire feature map to establish coarse matches, limiting further\nimprovements in accuracy and efficiency.

Specifically, the matching stage is decomposed into two\nprogressive phases, bridged by a region-based selective cross-attention\nmechanism designed to enhance feature discriminability. In the second phase,\none-to-one matches are determined by restricting the search range to the\none-to-many prior areas identified in the first phase. Additionally, this\npipeline benefits from incorporating high-level features, which helps reduce\nthe computational costs of low-level feature extraction.

        "summary": "Driven by the ``scale-is-everything'' paradigm, modern machine learning\nincreasingly demands ever-larger datasets and models, yielding prohibitive\ncomputational and storage requirements. Dataset distillation mitigates this by\ncompressing an original dataset into a small set of synthetic samples, while\npreserving its full utility. Yet, existing methods either maximize performance\nunder fixed storage budgets or pursue suitable synthetic data representations\nfor redundancy removal, without jointly optimizing both objectives. In this\nwork, we propose a joint rate-utility optimization method for dataset\ndistillation. We parameterize synthetic samples as optimizable latent codes\ndecoded by extremely lightweight networks. We estimate the Shannon entropy of\nquantized latents as the rate measure and plug any existing distillation loss\nas the utility measure, trading them off via a Lagrange multiplier. To enable\nfair, cross-method comparisons, we introduce bits per class (bpc), a precise\nstorage metric that accounts for sample, label, and decoder parameter costs. On\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet-128, our method achieves up to $170\\times$\ngreater compression than standard distillation at comparable accuracy.

        "summary": "Designing high-quality presentation slides can be challenging for non-experts\ndue to the complexity involved in navigating various design choices. Numerous\nautomated tools can suggest layouts and color schemes, yet often lack the\nability to refine their own output, which is a key aspect in real-world\nworkflows. We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two\nroles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the\ndesign contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative\nloop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor\ncorrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,\nreaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models\nfor these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled\nperturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the\ncontributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab\noutperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by\nembracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished,\nprofessional slides.",

In clinically practiced methods, asymmetric lesion shape is one of\nthe criteria for diagnosing melanoma.

Subsequently, we propose a supporting technique, a supervised\nlearning image processing algorithm, to analyze the geometrical pattern of\nlesion shape, aiding non-experts in understanding the criteria of an asymmetric\nlesion. We then utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to\nextract shape, color, and texture features from dermoscopic images for training\na multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods from the literature. In the geometry-based experiment,\nwe achieved a 99.00% detection rate for dermatological asymmetric lesions.

        "summary": "With the high density of printed circuit board (PCB) design and the high\nspeed of production, the traditional PCB defect detection model is difficult to\ntake into account the accuracy and computational cost, and cannot meet the\nrequirements of high accuracy and real-time detection of tiny defects.\nTherefore, in this paper, a multi-scale PCB defect detection method is improved\nwith YOLOv8 using a comprehensive strategy of tiny target sensitivity strategy,\nnetwork lightweighting and adaptive pruning, which is able to improve the\ndetection speed and accuracy by optimizing the backbone network, the neck\nnetwork and the detection head, the loss function and the adaptive pruning\nrate. Firstly, a Ghost-HGNetv2 structure with fewer parameters is used in the\nbackbone network, and multilevel features are used to extract image semantic\nfeatures to discover accurate defects. Secondly, we integrate C2f-Faster with\nsmall number of parameters in the neck section to enhance the ability of\nmulti-level feature fusion. Next, in the Head part, we design a new GCDetect\ndetection head, which allows the prediction of bounding boxes and categories to\nshare the weights of GroupConv, and uses a small number of grouping\nconvolutions to accomplish the regression and classification tasks, which\nsignificantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining the accuracy\nof detection. We also design the Inner-MPDIoU boundary loss function to improve\nthe detection and localization of tiny targets. Finally, the model was pruned\nby an optimized adaptive pruning rate to further reduce the complexity of the\nmodel. Experimental results show that the model exhibits advantages in terms of\naccuracy and speed. On the publicly available PCB defect dataset, mAP0.5\nreaches 99.32% and mAP0.5:0.9 reaches 75.18%, which is 10.13% higher compared\nto YOLOv8n.",

        "summary": "Researchers have increasingly adopted Transformer-based models for inertial\nodometry. While Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their\nlimited sensitivity to local, fine-grained motion variations and lack of\ninherent inductive biases often hinder localization accuracy and\ngeneralization. Recent studies have shown that incorporating large-kernel\nconvolutions and Transformer-inspired architectural designs into CNN can\neffectively expand the receptive field, thereby improving global motion\nperception. Motivated by these insights, we propose a novel CNN-based module\ncalled the Dual-wing Adaptive Dynamic Mixer (DADM), which adaptively captures\nboth global motion patterns and local, fine-grained motion features from\ndynamic inputs. This module dynamically generates selective weights based on\nthe input, enabling efficient multi-scale feature aggregation. To further\nimprove temporal modeling, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Gating Unit (STGU),\nwhich selectively extracts representative and task-relevant motion features in\nthe temporal domain. This unit addresses the limitations of temporal modeling\nobserved in existing CNN approaches. Built upon DADM and STGU, we present a new\nCNN-based inertial odometry backbone, named Next Era of Inertial Odometry\n(IONext). Extensive experiments on six public datasets demonstrate that IONext\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) Transformer- and CNN-based\nmethods. For instance, on the RNIN dataset, IONext reduces the average ATE by\n10% and the average RTE by 12% compared to the representative model iMOT.",

To address this limitation, we propose \\textbf{PointLAMA}, a point\ncloud pretraining framework that combines task-aware point cloud serialization,\na hybrid encoder with integrated Latent Attention and Mamba blocks, and a\nconditional diffusion mechanism built upon the Mamba backbone. Specifically,\nthe task-aware point cloud serialization employs Hilbert/Trans-Hilbert\nspace-filling curves and axis-wise sorting to structurally align point tokens\nfor classification and segmentation tasks, respectively. Our lightweight Latent\nAttention block features a Point-wise Multi-head Latent Attention (PMLA)\nmodule, which is specifically designed to align with the Mamba architecture by\nleveraging the shared latent space characteristics of PMLA and Mamba. This\nenables enhanced local context modeling while preserving overall efficiency. To\nfurther enhance representation learning, we incorporate a conditional diffusion\nmechanism during pretraining, which denoises perturbed feature sequences\nwithout relying on explicit point-wise reconstruction. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that PointLAMA achieves competitive performance on multiple\nbenchmark datasets with minimal parameter count and FLOPs, validating its\neffectiveness for efficient point cloud pretraining.",

        "summary": "The design of restorative dental crowns from intraoral scans is\nlabor-intensive for dental technicians. To address this challenge, we propose a\nnovel voxel-based framework for automated dental crown design (VBCD). The VBCD\nframework generates an initial coarse dental crown from voxelized intraoral\nscans, followed by a fine-grained refiner incorporating distance-aware\nsupervision to improve accuracy and quality. During the training stage, we\nemploy the Curvature and Margin line Penalty Loss (CMPL) to enhance the\nalignment of the generated crown with the margin line. Additionally, a\npositional prompt based on the FDI tooth numbering system is introduced to\nfurther improve the accuracy of the generated dental crowns. Evaluation on a\nlarge-scale dataset of intraoral scans demonstrated that our approach\noutperforms existing methods, providing a robust solution for personalized\ndental crown design.",

        "summary": "Robustness and resource-efficiency are two highly desirable properties for\nmodern machine learning models. However, achieving them jointly remains a\nchallenge. In this paper, we position high learning rates as a facilitator for\nsimultaneously achieving robustness to spurious correlations and network\ncompressibility. We demonstrate that large learning rates also produce\ndesirable representation properties such as invariant feature utilization,\nclass separation, and activation sparsity. Importantly, our findings indicate\nthat large learning rates compare favorably to other hyperparameters and\nregularization methods, in consistently satisfying these properties in tandem.\nIn addition to demonstrating the positive effect of large learning rates across\ndiverse spurious correlation datasets, models, and optimizers, we also present\nstrong evidence that the previously documented success of large learning rates\nin standard classification tasks is likely due to its effect on addressing\nhidden/rare spurious correlations in the training dataset.",

However, these studies focus on small\nnumbers of hand-picked filters in particular styles. In order to more\neffectively incorporate the wide ranges of filters present on various social\nmedia applications, we introduce a framework that allows for larger-scale study\nof the impact of facial filters on automated recognition. This framework\nincludes a controlled dataset of face images, a principled filter selection\nprocess that selects a representative range of filters for experimentation, and\na set of experiments to evaluate the filters' impact on recognition. We\ndemonstrate our framework with a case study of filters from the American\napplications Instagram and Snapchat and the Chinese applications Meitu and Pitu\nto uncover cross-cultural differences. Finally, we show how the filtering\neffect in a face embedding space can easily be detected and restored to improve\nface recognition performance.",

        "title": "A Low-Cost Machine Learning Approach for Timber Diameter Estimation",
        "summary": "The wood processing industry, particularly in facilities such as sawmills and\nMDF production lines, requires accurate and efficient identification of species\nand thickness of the wood. Although traditional methods rely heavily on expert\nhuman labor, they are slow, inconsistent, and prone to error, especially when\nprocessing large volumes. This study focuses on practical and cost-effective\nmachine learning frameworks that automate the estimation of timber log diameter\nusing standard RGB images captured under real-world working conditions. We\nemploy the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm, fine-tuned on a public dataset\n(TimberSeg 1.0), to detect individual timber logs and estimate thickness\nthrough bounding-box dimensions. Unlike previous methods that require expensive\nsensors or controlled environments, this model is trained on images taken in\ntypical industrial sheds during timber delivery. Experimental results show that\nthe model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.64, demonstrating\nreliable log detection even with modest computing resources. This lightweight,\nscalable solution holds promise for practical integration into existing\nworkflows, including on-site inventory management and preliminary sorting,\nparticularly in small and medium-sized operations.",
