        "summary": "Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging\ntask. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to\nscale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In\nthis paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate\nnoise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the\nlimitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose\nLongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video\ngeneration. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:\n1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation\nacross clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces\nalignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual\ndegradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates\nboth dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,\ncomplemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively\nbalances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also\nintroduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100\nhigh-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,\neach lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and\nquality.",

        "summary": "This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly\nenhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex\nvisual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit\nlimitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and\nprecise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.\nVisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured\ninformation extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The\nextractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a\nrich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines\nwith user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs\n(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed\nImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,\nand Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs\nacross tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results\ndemonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction\nadherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,\nvisually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text.

In the present work, we propose\nevTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face\nexpression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a\nfeature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,\nbuilt by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem\n(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to\nthe face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer\nlearning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions\ncompared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an\narchitecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression\ndynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as\nTIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed\nframework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

        "title": "RAAG: Ratio Aware Adaptive Guidance",
        "summary": "Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in\nimage and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the\nstandard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite\ntheir practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with\ndifferent stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step\nregimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and\nanalyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely\nsensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative\nstrength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous\ntheoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is\nintrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and\ncauses exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To\naddress this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive\nguidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps\nbased on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method\nis lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible\nwith standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image\n(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables\nup to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,\nrobustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm\nthe generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and\nhyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance\nadaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative\nmodels.",

        "summary": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in\ntext-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large\nparameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce\nmemory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from\nsevere performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two\nkey obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model\nweights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform\nquantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;\n(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated\nvalues, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in\nspecific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these\nissues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We\nintroduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with\nthe weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an\nAdaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or\noutlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating\nthe impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX\nunder various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,\nand sDCI datasets.

This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM\nwhile enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this\npipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of\nunified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to\nenable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:\nunderstanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the\nsource image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and\nmakes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing\ninstruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing\nfor coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.\nThe verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the\nintermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective\nfeedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.\nThis understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,\ndelivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner.

        "title": "Causal Disentanglement and Cross-Modal Alignment for Enhanced Few-Shot Learning",
        "summary": "Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using\nlimited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled\nrepresentations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process\nto obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which\nhinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual\ndisentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal\nalignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent\ncross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through\nfine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a\ncross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations\nthrough mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification\noutputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification\naccuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of\nfew-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining\ncomputational efficiency.

Existing methods\ntypically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,\nwhich dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their\ninherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than\nhomogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework\ndesigned to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific\nadvantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling\nimplicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where\nmodalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover\nmodality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy\nthat decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for\ncomplementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for\nprotected modality-specific optimization.

        "summary": "Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling\na wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,\ntheir performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects\nlike hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,\nwe introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha\nmattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present\nFaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality\nalpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes\nand per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this\nuncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive\nknowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on\nambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic\nconsistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation\nmasks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for\nreal-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by\nexplicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling\nclearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed\nCelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for\nocclusion-aware face matting.

        "summary": "Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic\ninterest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and\nentertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce\npaired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of\nadvanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to\naccurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal\nconsistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\nDreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired\nhuman-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further\nleverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the\nfirst stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a\nmulti-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to\nsynthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.\nThese images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video\ngeneration. \\textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with\nfine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input\ncontent, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a\npretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures\nlong-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible\ndynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate\nthat DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content\nand temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

        "summary": "The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the\nfield of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow\ninference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based\ntalking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first\nreal-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our\napproach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via\na temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate\ngeneration. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed\nlatent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to\ngenerate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video\nlatent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully\ndesigned Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient\ntalking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and\naccelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous\nnoise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our\nframework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous\nmotion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated\nvideo clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with\nsignificantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and\nspeed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.",

        "summary": "Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to\nadapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of\nmultimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image\nclasses. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality\ninformation, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,\nthereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method\ndynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering\nmechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the\ncontinual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention\nmodule, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can\nleverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce\nclass-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical\nand natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

        "summary": "Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents\nsignificant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction\nimpedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require\nmillions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical\nfine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion\npolicies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong\ndependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for\nfine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement\nlearning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment\ninteractions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective\nadaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline\nplay interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,\nmaking the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot\nlearning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across\neight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude\nfewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this\nis the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world\nrobotic skills using an offline world model.

        "summary": "Applying machine learning to real-world medical data, e.g. from hospital\narchives, has the potential to revolutionize disease detection in brain images.\nHowever, detecting pathology in such heterogeneous cohorts is a difficult\nchallenge. Normative modeling, a form of unsupervised anomaly detection, offers\na promising approach to studying such cohorts where the ``normal'' behavior is\nmodeled and can be used at subject level to detect deviations relating to\ndisease pathology. Diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for anomaly\ndetection due to their ability to capture complex data distributions and\ngenerate high-quality images. Their performance relies on image restoration;\ndifferences between the original and restored images highlight potential\nabnormalities. However, unlike normative models, these diffusion model\napproaches do not incorporate clinical information which provides important\ncontext to guide the disease detection process. Furthermore, standard\napproaches often poorly restore healthy regions, resulting in poor\nreconstructions and suboptimal detection performance. We present CADD, the\nfirst conditional diffusion model for normative modeling in 3D images. To guide\nthe healthy restoration process, we propose a novel inference inpainting\nstrategy which balances anomaly removal with retention of subject-specific\nfeatures. Evaluated on three challenging datasets, including clinical scans,\nwhich may have lower contrast, thicker slices, and motion artifacts, CADD\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in detecting neurological abnormalities\nin heterogeneous cohorts.",

        "summary": "Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in\nhow users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain\ninsight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated\ncontent are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other\nmemes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called\nMeme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,\nmost existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual\nbackground, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme\nmatching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude\nthe many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of\nautomated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to\ncontemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader\nformulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show\nthat conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise\ncomputation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes\nbut fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the\nsegment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image\nmeasures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a\nprompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for\nmeme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared\nvisual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that\nrequires more sophisticated matching techniques.",

This task directly applies to educational and\nresearch domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR\npost-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated\nequations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor\nmultilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully\nopen-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio\nsamples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,\ndrawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction\nmodels and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating\ncomparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%\nvs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed\nS2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a\nsubstantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for\nLaTeX formatting artifacts (27% vs. 64%).

To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis\napproach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal\nimages via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated\nauto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked\nsampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves\nfine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over\nsynthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly\nDetection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy\nthat emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text\nsimilarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three\nbenchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD\noutperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection\ntasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup\ncompared to diffusion-based alternatives.

However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:\nspecific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,\nboth of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and\nassociation (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each\ninstance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing\nanti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a\ndistribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the\ncurrent domain into the domain-specific representations with the different\ndomain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,\nwe propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the\nunified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further\nmitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)\nmechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly\nmodel inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,\ndistribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current\ndomain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,\nimproving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms\nthe existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on\nanti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively.

As an example we consider here image recovery,\nwhere SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of\nproblems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms\nthat are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the\nlearned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing\nor storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a\ncombination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.\nTherefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in\nSDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the\nsparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization\nmethods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on\nthe method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in\ngeneral not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite\ndifferent from the learning database.",

These patterns reflect and\nreinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive\nbiases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which\nin turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts.

        "title": "VideoGuard: Protecting Video Content from Unauthorized Editing",
        "summary": "With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative\nmodels can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled\nmanner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these\ncapabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has\nattempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative\nmodels, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to\nvideo content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named\nVideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious\nediting. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly\nunnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended\ngenerative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and\ninter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying\nimage-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield\nvideo from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint\nframe optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.\nFurthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization\nobjectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce\noutputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to\noptimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and\nsubjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results\nshow that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the\nbaseline methods.",

        "summary": "Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated\nsignificant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face\nthe inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative\ninference, which often leads to \"hallucinations\", outputs that are not grounded\nin the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these\nissues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational\ncost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit\na long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,\nyet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive\nresearch into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship\nbetween this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify\na consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input\ndiminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key\nfactor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these\ninsights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative\nDecoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more\nimage-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with\nhigher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those\nfrom the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and\nsuppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.\nExtensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks\ndemonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and\nimproving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no\nadditional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient\nframework applicable to various models.",

        "summary": "Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the\ninterference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial\ndiscrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily\nrely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical\nchallenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real\ntextures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while\nremoving moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera\nframework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus\n(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one\ndefocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We\nuse the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,\nso as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise\ndemoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to\naddress any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and\ndefocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the\ndemoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional\ntraining loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step\ninvolves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the\nCNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely\noutperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.",

        "summary": "Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable\nperformance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single\nauxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on\ndiverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to\nmanually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert\nknowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following\nchallenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and\ndiverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to\nunseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category\ninformation, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic\nsubspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis\n(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on\nvisual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract\nrepresentative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features\nand explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.\nGiven the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to\nmodel semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into\nprompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,\nextensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods\nby 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and\nmedical datasets.

Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training\nsolely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible\ndisentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on\narbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion\nmodels and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51\nstyles $\\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement\nthrough systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,\nwe demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot\nsettings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that\ndisentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.",

        "summary": "Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which\nare closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons\nhave dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of\ncapturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,\nand capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a\nnovel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and\nsilhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D\nsilhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly\nestimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new\nmodality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In\naddition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been\ndeveloped to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.\nExtensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed\nDepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and\nattains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.",

In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\\emph{i.e.},\nlimited text tokens \\emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.\nHowever, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during\nquantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.\nMotivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ\nframework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token\nredundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an\nenhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining\ncompatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and\neffectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise\nbackward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.\nExtensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit\nsettings.

        "summary": "The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to\nVideo Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost\nof processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled\nframes is a common strategy, we observe a \"less is more\" phenomenon where\nexcessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.\nConcurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,\nstill yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To\naddress these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel\npost-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP\nemploys an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and\nCLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single\nrepresentatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a\nlightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with\nminimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench\nand VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach\ndemonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total\ninput tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality\nset of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves\naccuracy over baselines that use more frames.

        "summary": "Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging\ndue to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing\nenhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,\nlimiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge\ndetection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage\napproach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we\nintroduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores\nglobal illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and\ninter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust\npriors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error\naccumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs\ncomplementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure\nrefinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled\npatches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained\ndetails without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on\nhigh-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and\nprioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications\ndemonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance\nwhile maintaining efficiency.

        "summary": "Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results\nyet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test\ndata. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and\nProgressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive\nsemantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text\ndescription of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the\nlack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf\ntext-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring\nsource domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images\nintroduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images\ncannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic\ndata, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches\nindividually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial\nprecision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented\nintermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more\nstable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the\nimpact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,\nensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot\nsemantic segmentation. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ROUJINN/SDGPA",

However, collecting high-quality paired makeup\ndatasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is\nconstrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while\nexisting synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or\ninconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods\ntypically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often\ndistort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and\ntext-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,\nundermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality\nsynthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles\nwhile preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon\nthe diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from\nexisting datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup\ntransfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired\nwith 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality\nbare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work\nthat focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that\nFFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets\nand serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.",

        "summary": "The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors\ncontinuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery\ndetection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn\nnew forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,\na phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling\nthem to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while\nleaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for\naddressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant\nlimitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional\nimages, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images\nlack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when\nfeatures from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to\ndistinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the\nsame regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery\nDetection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector\n(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift\nCompensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional\nimage inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the\noverlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior\nperformance while notably reducing forgetting.",

        "summary": "Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content\nthrough natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as\nsemantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent\ninversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved\npromising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in\ntheir editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in\nthe inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This\nissue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are\ndissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure\nor unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a\ntraining-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the\ninverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and\ncontrollability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and\ngeneral-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural\nmodification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on\nthree challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental\nresults show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of\nsemantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the\neffectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose\nimage editing.",

While recent\ndiffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling\ncomplex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and\nfail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained\nDiffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework\nspecifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a\nRegion-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by\nfreezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during\nthe reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.\nAdditionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into\nthe discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local\nanomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the\nMVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in\nsegmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for\npixel-level anomaly synthesis.",

        "summary": "Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with\nsatellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert\nworkflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale\nautomation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,\nhigh-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking\nlow-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are\nessential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap\nwith Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter\nresolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over\nAustralia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:\nLandsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,\ncomprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across\neight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped\npipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human\nverification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark\nreveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The\nopen-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in\ncaptioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current\napproaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on\nLandsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and\nboosts VQA accuracy from \\textbf{0.74} to 0.87.

        "summary": "Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need\nfor precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities.

We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent\nfor Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations\nthrough two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that\nimproves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past\nexperiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping\n(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases\nduring learning.

        "summary": "Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal\nlearning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing\nprivate user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples\n(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model\ntraining, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning\nof meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically\ngenerate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their\nassociated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is\noften computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on\nexternal third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:\nusers must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve\nprotection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction\nhas severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection\nsolutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \\textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable\nExample (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using\nonly text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by\nemploying a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image\n(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce\neffective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected\ndata substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal\nretrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect\ngeneralizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning\nsettings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of \"zero-contact data\nprotection\", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their\ntextual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.",

In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under\nchallenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in\ninaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement\nmodule, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward\n3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D\nreconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing\npretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction\nrobustness.

In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space\nmodel. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance\ncorrupted inputs in the feature space.

The framework utilizes CycleGAN to\ngenerate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from\ndifferent camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,\nbased on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates\nmulti-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.\nA learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local\ninformation within global features is introduced to enhance learning\ncomprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.\nExperimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate\nsignificant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional\nenhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean\nFeature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global\nand local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the\nframework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids\nambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,\nTop-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution\nfor the UDA in Person ReID.

        "summary": "Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond\ntraditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful\nconnections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source\ninformation retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that\naddresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our\napproach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between\nvideos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring\nend-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a\nhuman-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking\nalgorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple\nvideo sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that\nhierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and\n3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this\nhierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our\napproach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset\nspecifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental\nresults demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning\ntasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior\nanalysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly\noutperforming existing methods.

        "summary": "Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and\nhigh-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a\nlarge number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting\npractical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian\nmodels but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the\nscene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression\nquality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,\na method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering\nquality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least\nsignificant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective\npruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module\ncompresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving\nthe codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the\ncodebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the\ncodebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and\nmitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.\nExperimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method\nachieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering\nquality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but\nalso improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing\nexcellent performance and strong generalization ability.",

To address this issue, we propose a\nnew scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes\nscene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities.

By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic\nframe reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding\ncapabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos.

        "summary": "Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create\ndiverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also\nwell-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.\nNegative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying\nwhat an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an\nideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In\nthis work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free\nguidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\\it Adaptive Negative Sampling\nWithout External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and\nnegative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal\nunderstanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of\ngenerating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,\napplicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of\nimage concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and\nincomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the\nbaselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the\nother methods.",

        "summary": "Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle\nto generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when\nconfronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially\nvariant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored\nchallenge. In this work, we investigate \\emph{scale equivariance} as a core\ninductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating\nscale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on\nspatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework\nequipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)\nand an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions\nand dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM\nfacilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between\nsignal and feature paths.

In\nthis work, we propose AMD-Mamba, a novel multi-modal framework for AMD\nprognosis, and further develop a new AMD biomarker. This framework integrates\ncolor fundus images with genetic variants and socio-demographic variables. At\nits core, AMD-Mamba introduces an innovative metric learning strategy that\nleverages AMD severity scale score as prior knowledge. This strategy allows the\nmodel to learn richer feature representations by aligning learned features with\nclinical phenotypes, thereby improving the capability of conventional prognosis\nmethods in capturing disease progression patterns. In addition, unlike existing\nmodels that use traditional CNN backbones and focus primarily on local\ninformation, such as the presence of drusen, AMD-Mamba applies Vision Mamba and\nsimultaneously fuses local and long-range global information, such as vascular\nchanges. Furthermore, we enhance prediction performance through multi-scale\nfusion, combining image information with clinical variables at different\nresolutions. We evaluate AMD-Mamba on the AREDS dataset, which includes 45,818\ncolor fundus photographs, 52 genetic variants, and 3 socio-demographic\nvariables from 2,741 subjects. Our experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed biomarker is one of the most significant biomarkers for the\nprogression of AMD.

        "summary": "The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind\ndeconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated\nimage and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior\ndistribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP\nestimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its\neffectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based\npriors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through\nan empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two\nkey properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,\nthe landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural\nimages. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the\nblind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to\nproduce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.\nHowever local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient\ndescent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind\ndeconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations\nrequires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.\nWe validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the\npractical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and\noptimization techniques.",

        "summary": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success\nin unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models\nare first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an\nintermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward\ndiffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely\non specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them\nversatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically\nassume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in\nrealistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion\nmodels for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and\nanomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood\nestimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust\nregression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust\ndiffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current\nstate of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when\nonly contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing\ndiffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\\% higher AUROC and 10.37\\%\nhigher AUPRC on MVTec datasets.

        "summary": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently\ntransformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity\nnovel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural\nnetworks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction\nchallenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of\nGaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more\nintuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly\nwell-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based\nsimulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural\nRadiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the\nphotorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured\nrepresentation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance\nmodeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These\nembeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest\nGaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we\nintroduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest\nGaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a\nmulti-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.\nTogether, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as\nGaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence\nis immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of\nimplicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene\nmanipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,\nbridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering.

        "summary": "Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose\nestimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nwith pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative\nbreakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the\nadoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these\nadvancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf\nnetwork architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1)\nIntroducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on\nself-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)\nEnhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences\nthrough feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid\nstructures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature\nrepresentations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model\nobtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW\ndatasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies\nsignificantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose\nestimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation\ntechnology.",

        "summary": "Galaxy image translation is an important application in galaxy physics and\ncosmology. With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has\nbeen performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information\nextraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly\ndetection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the\npixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack\nof discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical\ninformation, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely\non high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the\neffectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical\ninformation (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and\nmorphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin\nTransformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS\nand CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of\nincapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures\nof galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In\nparticular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain\nmeaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable\nuncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to\nthe nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images\nmay still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise\nfor downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly\nrequired. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical\ninformation is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the\ndevelopment of image translation models for scientific use.",

We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic\nencoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a\ncompact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational\ninference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26\nthree-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric\nuncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore\ndifferent probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace\ndistributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset\nwith optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean\nper-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree\naspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual\npose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,\nwith our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.\nAs an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions\nenables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,\nresulting in an F1 score of 0.870.

Subsequently, this repository is used to\nimprove the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing\nthe model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns.

        "summary": "In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope\nslide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire\nstructures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling\nanalysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,\ninhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing\nregions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits\nstate-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to\nreconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce\nSemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual\nhistopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different\nfragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching\ncandidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments\non three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher\nyields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art\nin correct boundary matches.",

        "summary": "Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and\nintermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,\ndynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which\ncan facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike\nfixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera\nmovement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural\nintegrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address\nthese challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network\n(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy\nvideos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction\nand Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)\nmodule. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature\nrepresentation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,\nsparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in\nfeature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch\ninformation exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen\nmulti-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying\nreceptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,\nthereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on\nseveral challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and\ngeneralization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive\nperformance in video-based polyp detection tasks.",

While the challenges in\nhigh-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress\nof general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action\nestimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.\nTo this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,\nActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of\nlearning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink\nreformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,\ncalled \"action flow\", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be\nretrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,\nActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a\ncoarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of\naction flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is\na dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that\ndynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be\nused to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a\nmulti-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action\nflows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate\naction estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes.

While data\naugmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield\nlimited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,\ndeveloping a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly\nrobust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic\nanalysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among\ndiverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing\nrobustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial\nAugmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature\nand training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation\nprocess from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation\noffline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial\nperturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted\non multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results\ndemonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for\ndata-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the\nonline generation of adversarial examples during training.

Current methods often rely on Vision and\nLanguage Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as\nimage-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level\ninteraction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding\ntextual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the\nmodel's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,\nwe propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an\nend-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware\nprompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware\nprompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on\nthe input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This\napproach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than\ngeneric image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine\nHOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which\nhelps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities\nacross categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve\ninter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate\nvisually similar but semantically distinct actions.

        "title": "Neovascularization Segmentation via a Multilateral Interaction-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network",
        "summary": "Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet\nage-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of\nblindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography\nangiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological\nchanges, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,\naccurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for\nclinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular\nCNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and\nboundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets\nconstraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper\nconstructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a\nnovel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation\nnetwork (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological\ninformation, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the\ngraph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two\ngraph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)\nand Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework\nencodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the\nimage into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason\nabout higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,\nenabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,\nan uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts\nand noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that\nMTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\\% for\nregion segmentation and 88.12\\% for vessel segmentation.",

        "summary": "The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical\nchallenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the\nshape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to\nfind and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,\nsuch as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,\nwhereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost\nof more demanding computational resources which might not be available on\nspace-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods\nare not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of\ninterest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to\nlarge biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the\nreal-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state\nestimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a\nchaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast\nFEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed\nto leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking\nsensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours\nto their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to\nthe motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an\nattention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly\ntrained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The\nresulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than\nclassical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other\nstate-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on\nrenderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.",

        "summary": "In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context\nin 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate\nfrequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction\nstrategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain\ninformation, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the\nfundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency\ndomains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths\nthat frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,\na Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D\nmedical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch\narchitecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency\ndomains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to\npreserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency\ndomain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global\ncontextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency\ndomain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D\nmulti-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and\nglobal cues.

Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited\nvision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.\nHowever, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,\nwhile overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is\ncrucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose\nMulti-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs\ncoarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain\nshifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture\nglobal contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines\nmedium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.\nFinally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial\ndetail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware\ncalibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to\nthe domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic\nsegmentation task of domain generalization.",

        "summary": "Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via\nnatural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.\nUnlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific\nsemantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the\nscarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is\ncostly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data\nsynthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise\ninstruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To\naddress these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a\ngarment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories\naligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced\nand diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit\nScore, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies\nbetween garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during\nconstruction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate\ntriplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the\nfirst instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing.

To this end, we\npropose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical\nimage analysis.

Our\nexperimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors\nfor CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The\nperformance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while\nsmall for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be\nconsidered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing\nSurprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for\nclassification.

        "summary": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges\ndue to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode\nconfigurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across\ndomains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and\nimputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of\ncross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To\naddress heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC\nfirst standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional\nunification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.\nUnlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,\nIMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a\nchannel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high\nresolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach\nsimulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal\ninstabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for\nrobust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a\ndisentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial\ninformation of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity\nwhile enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across\n10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,\nachieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and\ncross-center validation scenarios.

However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational\noverhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world\nscenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods\nmerge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit\nefficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly\nintegrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient\nTest-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of\nTTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a\ntheoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that\ntoken aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully\nmitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods.

Our method follows a two-stage process:\nfirst, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a\nlarge-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact\ncounterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to\nclient devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally.

It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed\nbehavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon\n(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most\nexisting approaches treat these two components as independent classification\ntasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking\ntheir inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented\nrepresentations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct\nthe egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting\nstrategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified\nPrompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component\nrepresentations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and\nnouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair\nform. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an\nattention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure\nthe prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training\nobjective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two\nperspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge\nOrthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,\nEPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets.

        "summary": "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust\n3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching\nfrom 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require\nmulti-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,\nwe propose a \\textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \\textbf{S}parse 3D object\n\\textbf{D}etection \\textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of\nDDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in\nlatent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level\ndenoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand\nscene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and\nreliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising\nmechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise\nsamples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.\nFurthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to\nperceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature\nmissing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a\nfully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network\ndesign of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,\nfurther enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public\nbenchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving\nstate-of-the-art detection.",

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable\nability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a\nsubstantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a\npotential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often\nperform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may\nintroduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose\nGeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy\nprotection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a\nfeature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical\ninformation, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints\ngeo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module\nthat jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure\neffectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging\nbenchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in\nblack-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on\nvisual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore\nadversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by\nadvanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating\nprivacy concerns.",

        "summary": "Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in\nneural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection\nare either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against\ntransformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive\nGradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG\nis neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large\ntransformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a\nunified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original\ncontributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that\nfocuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,\nincreasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,\nAFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss\nthrough learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial\nperturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial\nperturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by\nadding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which\ncan cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments\nconducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the\nefficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms\nexisting attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to\n83% with superior speed and imperceptibility.

While for normal size models,\npre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for\nsmall models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is\nnot clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on\nincreasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M\nparameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in\nthe infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object\nrecognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and\nsystematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different\ndatasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a\ncertain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of\nout-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to\nstill use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they\nmight work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working\nconditions are different.",

        "summary": "Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes\nand settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning\nbased techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such\napproaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally\nintensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis\nacross extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or\nlocating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by\nproposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse\nbuilding distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine\nlearning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are\nfirst used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain\nbuildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The\nremaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation\nalgorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test\nsections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6\ninch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency\ncompared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the\ntechnique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights\nits potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the\npipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.\nGalway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25\ninch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the\nGreat Famine period.",

        "summary": "Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,\nhindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement\n(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping\nnetworks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling\nunder extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on\nsimplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To\naddress these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that\nleverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal\nreasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps\ncontinuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from\nlarge-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,\nencoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of\ndegradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to\ndistribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.\nTherefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to\nsystematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level\nCausal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with\nthe brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a\nFeature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective\nAttention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by\nillumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while\nenhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible\nfeature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail\nReconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the\nmatched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable\nconvolution techniques.",

        "summary": "As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has\nfocused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple\nAVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale\nreal-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most\nstudies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity\nraw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce\nrealistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV\nscenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale\nefficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we\npropose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic\nLiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from\nmicroscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives\n(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the\nspatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop\nLine-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion\nrelationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP\narchitecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to\nthe prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the\ndetection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection\nmodel, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further\nvalidate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for\ntasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,\nspeed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be\nseamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will\nbe open-sourced upon publication.",

By leveraging barometric\nreadings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for\nboth improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global\ntranslation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh\ncoordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose\nrepresentation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark\ndatasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results\ndemonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods\nthat use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.",

        "title": "Following Route Instructions using Large Vision-Language Models: A Comparison between Low-level and Panoramic Action Spaces",
        "summary": "Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling\nautonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural\nlanguage instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have\nshown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models\nspecifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of\noff-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used\nlow-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as \"turn\nleft\" or \"move forward\"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces\nwith discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether\noff-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or\nsimulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether\nsuch models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this\nend, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the\nRoom-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both\nlow-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%\nsuccess rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs\ncan learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind\nmodels specifically designed for this task.",

        "summary": "Accurate preoperative prediction of erectile dysfunction (ED) is important\nfor counseling patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. While clinical\nfeatures are established predictors, the added value of preoperative MRI\nremains underexplored. We investigate whether MRI provides additional\npredictive value for ED at 12 months post-surgery, evaluating four modeling\nstrategies: (1) a clinical-only baseline, representing current\nstate-of-the-art; (2) classical models using handcrafted anatomical features\nderived from MRI; (3) deep learning models trained directly on MRI slices; and\n(4) multimodal fusion of imaging and clinical inputs. Imaging-based models\n(maximum AUC 0.569) slightly outperformed handcrafted anatomical approaches\n(AUC 0.554) but fell short of the clinical baseline (AUC 0.663). Fusion models\noffered marginal gains (AUC 0.586) but did not exceed clinical-only\nperformance. SHAP analysis confirmed that clinical features contributed most to\npredictive performance. Saliency maps from the best-performing imaging model\nsuggested a predominant focus on anatomically plausible regions, such as the\nprostate and neurovascular bundles. While MRI-based models did not improve\npredictive performance over clinical features, our findings suggest that they\ntry to capture patterns in relevant anatomical structures and may complement\nclinical predictors in future multimodal approaches.",
