        "summary": "Flow matching and diffusion models have shown impressive results in\ntext-to-image generation, producing photorealistic images through an iterative\ndenoising process. A common strategy to speed up synthesis is to perform early\ndenoising at lower resolutions. However, traditional methods that downscale and\nupscale in pixel space often introduce artifacts and distortions. These issues\narise when the upscaled images are re-encoded into the latent space, leading to\ndegraded final image quality. To address this, we propose {\\bf Latent Space\nScaling Generation (LSSGen)}, a framework that performs resolution scaling\ndirectly in the latent space using a lightweight latent upsampler. Without\naltering the Transformer or U-Net architecture, LSSGen improves both efficiency\nand visual quality while supporting flexible multi-resolution generation. Our\ncomprehensive evaluation covering text-image alignment and perceptual quality\nshows that LSSGen significantly outperforms conventional scaling approaches.\nWhen generating $1024^2$ images at similar speeds, it achieves up to 246\\%\nTOPIQ score improvement.",

        "summary": "The application of Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) to remote\nsensing (RS) imagery has garnered significant attention due to their superior\ncapability in various downstream tasks. A key challenge lies in the scarcity of\nhigh-quality, large-scale, image-text paired training data. Recently, several\nworks introduced extensive image-text datasets for RS and trained their VLFMs.\nHowever, due to the rudimentary methods used for generating captions, the\nquality of datasets is suboptimal, requiring larger volumes of training data,\nwhile only yielding modest performance improvements. In this paper, we propose\na two-stage method named MpGI(Multi-Perspective Generation and Integration) for\ngenerating high-quality text captions for RS images. Firstly, we generate\ndistinct and detailed descriptions from different perspectives using\nRule-MLLM(Multimodal Large Language Model) Relay Generation and MLLMs\ngeneration methods. Next, we utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to integrate\nthese diverse descriptions into comprehensive captions, capturing details from\nmultiple perspectives. Finally, we have created the HQRS-IT-210K dataset,\nincluding about 210,000 RS images and 1.3 million captions. We fine-tuned two\nVLFMs using our dataset: CLIP, a discriminative model, and CoCa, an\nimage-to-text generative model. This process resulted in our proposed HQRS-CLIP\nand RS-CoCa models. Experimental results demonstrate that HQRS-CLIP surpassed\nthe previous SOTA RS CLIP model in various downstream tasks while using only\n4.2\\% of the training data. RS-CoCa outperforms other advanced approaches\nacross benchmark datasets and can generate captions for RS images that rival or\neven exceed manual annotations. Dataset, pre-trained models, and codes will be\nreleased at https://github.com/YiguoHe/HQRS-210K-and-HQRS-CLIP.",

Existing methods\ntypically necessitate supervised learning based on human-refined masks in the\nventricular myocardium, which become impractical without contrast agents.

        "summary": "Despite the integration of safety alignment and external filters,\ntext-to-image (T2I) generative models are still susceptible to producing\nharmful content, such as sexual or violent imagery. This raises serious\nconcerns about unintended exposure and potential misuse. Red teaming, which\naims to proactively identify diverse prompts that can elicit unsafe outputs\nfrom the T2I system (including the core generative model as well as potential\nexternal safety filters and other processing components), is increasingly\nrecognized as an essential method for assessing and improving safety before\nreal-world deployment. Yet, existing automated red teaming approaches often\ntreat prompt discovery as an isolated, prompt-level optimization task, which\nlimits their scalability, diversity, and overall effectiveness. To bridge this\ngap, in this paper, we propose DREAM, a scalable red teaming framework to\nautomatically uncover diverse problematic prompts from a given T2I system.\nUnlike most prior works that optimize prompts individually, DREAM directly\nmodels the probabilistic distribution of the target system's problematic\nprompts, which enables explicit optimization over both effectiveness and\ndiversity, and allows efficient large-scale sampling after training. To achieve\nthis without direct access to representative training samples, we draw\ninspiration from energy-based models and reformulate the objective into simple\nand tractable objectives. We further introduce GC-SPSA, an efficient\noptimization algorithm that provide stable gradient estimates through the long\nand potentially non-differentiable T2I pipeline. The effectiveness of DREAM is\nvalidated through extensive experiments, demonstrating that it surpasses 9\nstate-of-the-art baselines by a notable margin across a broad range of T2I\nmodels and safety filters in terms of prompt success rate and diversity.",

It introduces two key\ninnovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that\nenhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale\nBottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder that captures fine-grained details via\nmulti-resolution feature aggregation. Experiments on four publicly available\nbenchmark datasets (Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, and Decathlon Lung) demonstrate that\nMLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average Dice scores of\n87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung).

        "summary": "The rapid advancement of video diffusion models has been hindered by\nfundamental limitations in temporal modeling, particularly the rigid\nsynchronization of frame evolution imposed by conventional scalar timestep\nvariables. While task-specific adaptations and autoregressive models have\nsought to address these challenges, they remain constrained by computational\ninefficiency, catastrophic forgetting, or narrow applicability. In this work,\nwe present Pusa, a groundbreaking paradigm that leverages vectorized timestep\nadaptation (VTA) to enable fine-grained temporal control within a unified video\ndiffusion framework. Besides, VTA is a non-destructive adaptation, which means\nit fully preserves the capabilities of the base model. By finetuning the SOTA\nWan2.1-T2V-14B model with VTA, we achieve unprecedented efficiency --\nsurpassing the performance of Wan-I2V-14B with $\\leq$ 1/200 of the training\ncost (\\$500 vs. $\\geq$ \\$100,000) and $\\leq$ 1/2500 of the dataset size (4K vs.\n$\\geq$ 10M samples). Pusa not only sets a new standard for image-to-video (I2V)\ngeneration, achieving a VBench-I2V total score of 87.32\\% (vs. 86.86\\% of\nWan-I2V-14B), but also unlocks many zero-shot multi-task capabilities such as\nstart-end frames and video extension -- all without task-specific training.\nMeanwhile, Pusa can still perform text-to-video generation. Mechanistic\nanalyses reveal that our approach preserves the foundation model's generative\npriors while surgically injecting temporal dynamics, avoiding the combinatorial\nexplosion inherent to vectorized timesteps. This work establishes a scalable,\nefficient, and versatile paradigm for next-generation video synthesis,\ndemocratizing high-fidelity video generation for research and industry alike.\nCode is open-sourced at https://github.com/Yaofang-Liu/Pusa-VidGen",

        "summary": "Calibrating the confidence of neural network classifiers is essential for\nquantifying the reliability of their predictions during inference. However,\nconventional Gaussian Process (GP) calibration methods often fail to capture\nthe internal hierarchical structure of deep neural networks, limiting both\ninterpretability and effectiveness for assessing predictive reliability. We\npropose a Semantic-Aware Layer-wise Gaussian Process (SAL-GP) framework that\nmirrors the layered architecture of the target neural network. Instead of\napplying a single global GP correction, SAL-GP employs a multi-layer GP model,\nwhere each layer's feature representation is mapped to a local calibration\ncorrection. These layerwise GPs are coupled through a structured multi-layer\nkernel, enabling joint marginalization across all layers. This design allows\nSAL-GP to capture both local semantic dependencies and global calibration\ncoherence, while consistently propagating predictive uncertainty through the\nnetwork. The resulting framework enhances interpretability aligned with the\nnetwork architecture and enables principled evaluation of confidence\nconsistency and uncertainty quantification in deep models.",

        "summary": "Enhancing large vision-language models (LVLMs) with visual slow-thinking\nreasoning is crucial for solving complex multimodal tasks. However, since LVLMs\nare mainly trained with vision-language alignment, it is difficult to adopt\non-policy reinforcement learning (RL) to develop the slow thinking ability\nbecause the rollout space is restricted by its initial abilities. Off-policy RL\noffers a way to go beyond the current policy, but directly distilling\ntrajectories from external models may cause visual hallucinations due to\nmismatched visual perception abilities across models. To address these issues,\nthis paper proposes SOPHIA, a simple and scalable Semi-Off-Policy RL for\nvision-language slow-tHInking reAsoning. SOPHIA builds a semi-off-policy\nbehavior model by combining on-policy visual understanding from a trainable\nLVLM with off-policy slow-thinking reasoning from a language model, assigns\noutcome-based rewards to reasoning, and propagates visual rewards backward.\nThen LVLM learns slow-thinking reasoning ability from the obtained reasoning\ntrajectories using propagated rewards via off-policy RL algorithms. Extensive\nexperiments with InternVL2.5 and InternVL3.0 with 8B and 38B sizes show the\neffectiveness of SOPHIA. Notably, SOPHIA improves InternVL3.0-38B by 8.50% in\naverage, reaching state-of-the-art performance among open-source LVLMs on\nmultiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks, and even outperforms some\nclosed-source models (e.g., GPT-4.1) on the challenging MathVision and\nOlympiadBench, achieving 49.08% and 49.95% pass@1 accuracy, respectively.\nAnalysis shows SOPHIA outperforms supervised fine-tuning and direct on-policy\nRL methods, offering a better policy initialization for further on-policy\ntraining.",

To overcome this limitation, the proposed\napproach leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to systematically integrate\nvisual, textual, and audio modalities for enhanced semantic understanding. The\nDFR framework introduces three key innovations: 1) Multi-modal Decompose: a\nhierarchical decomposition scheme that extracts visual region proposals via\nSAM, expands textual semantics into fine-grained descriptors, and processes\naudio features for contextual enrichment; 2) Multi-modal Contrastive Fuse: a\nfusion strategy employing contrastive learning to maintain consistency across\nvisual, textual, and audio modalities while enabling dynamic semantic\ninteractions between foreground and background features; 3) Dual-path\nReconstruct: an adaptive integration mechanism combining semantic guidance from\ntri-modal fused tokens with geometric cues from multi-modal location priors.\nExtensive experiments across visual, textual, and audio modalities under both\nsynthetic and real settings demonstrate DFR's substantial performance\nimprovements over state-of-the-art methods.",

        "summary": "Despite the remarkable developments achieved by recent 3D generation works,\nscaling these methods to geographic extents, such as modeling thousands of\nsquare kilometers of Earth's surface, remains an open challenge. We address\nthis through a dual innovation in data infrastructure and model architecture.\nFirst, we introduce Aerial-Earth3D, the largest 3D aerial dataset to date,\nconsisting of 50k curated scenes (each measuring 600m x 600m) captured across\nthe U.S. mainland, comprising 45M multi-view Google Earth frames. Each scene\nprovides pose-annotated multi-view images, depth maps, normals, semantic\nsegmentation, and camera poses, with explicit quality control to ensure terrain\ndiversity. Building on this foundation, we propose EarthCrafter, a tailored\nframework for large-scale 3D Earth generation via sparse-decoupled latent\ndiffusion. Our architecture separates structural and textural generation: 1)\nDual sparse 3D-VAEs compress high-resolution geometric voxels and textural 2D\nGaussian Splats (2DGS) into compact latent spaces, largely alleviating the\ncostly computation suffering from vast geographic scales while preserving\ncritical information. 2) We propose condition-aware flow matching models\ntrained on mixed inputs (semantics, images, or neither) to flexibly model\nlatent geometry and texture features independently. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that EarthCrafter performs substantially better in extremely\nlarge-scale generation.

        "summary": "Segments in computer vision are often defined by semantic considerations and\nare highly dependent on category-specific conventions. In contrast,\ndevelopmental psychology suggests that humans perceive the world in terms of\nSpelke objects--groupings of physical things that reliably move together when\nacted on by physical forces. Spelke objects thus operate on category-agnostic\ncausal motion relationships which potentially better support tasks like\nmanipulation and planning. In this paper, we first benchmark the Spelke object\nconcept, introducing the SpelkeBench dataset that contains a wide variety of\nwell-defined Spelke segments in natural images. Next, to extract Spelke\nsegments from images algorithmically, we build SpelkeNet, a class of visual\nworld models trained to predict distributions over future motions. SpelkeNet\nsupports estimation of two key concepts for Spelke object discovery: (1) the\nmotion affordance map, identifying regions likely to move under a poke, and (2)\nthe expected-displacement map, capturing how the rest of the scene will move.\nThese concepts are used for \"statistical counterfactual probing\", where diverse\n\"virtual pokes\" are applied on regions of high motion-affordance, and the\nresultant expected displacement maps are used define Spelke segments as\nstatistical aggregates of correlated motion statistics. We find that SpelkeNet\noutperforms supervised baselines like SegmentAnything (SAM) on SpelkeBench.\nFinally, we show that the Spelke concept is practically useful for downstream\napplications, yielding superior performance on the 3DEditBench benchmark for\nphysical object manipulation when used in a variety of off-the-shelf object\nmanipulation models.",

In this paper, we first propose HOComp, a novel approach for\ncompositing a foreground object onto a human-centric background image, while\nensuring harmonious interactions between the foreground object and the\nbackground person and their consistent appearances. Our approach includes two\nkey designs: (1) MLLMs-driven Region-based Pose Guidance (MRPG), which utilizes\nMLLMs to identify the interaction region as well as the interaction type (e.g.,\nholding and lefting) to provide coarse-to-fine constraints to the generated\npose for the interaction while incorporating human pose landmarks to track\naction variations and enforcing fine-grained pose constraints; and (2)\nDetail-Consistent Appearance Preservation (DCAP), which unifies a shape-aware\nattention modulation mechanism, a multi-view appearance loss, and a background\nconsistency loss to ensure consistent shapes/textures of the foreground and\nfaithful reproduction of the background human. We then propose the first\ndataset, named Interaction-aware Human-Object Composition (IHOC), for the task.\nExperimental results on our dataset show that HOComp effectively generates\nharmonious human-object interactions with consistent appearances, and\noutperforms relevant methods qualitatively and quantitatively.",

        "summary": "While the accuracy of face recognition systems has improved significantly in\nrecent years, the datasets used to train these models are often collected\nthrough web crawling without the explicit consent of users, raising ethical and\nprivacy concerns. To address this, many recent approaches have explored the use\nof synthetic data for training face recognition models. However, these models\ntypically underperform compared to those trained on real-world data. A common\nlimitation is that a single generator model is often used to create the entire\nsynthetic dataset, leading to model-specific artifacts that may cause\noverfitting to the generator's inherent biases and artifacts. In this work, we\npropose a solution by combining two state-of-the-art synthetic face datasets\ngenerated using architecturally distinct backbones. This fusion reduces\nmodel-specific artifacts, enhances diversity in pose, lighting, and\ndemographics, and implicitly regularizes the face recognition model by\nemphasizing identity-relevant features. We evaluate the performance of models\ntrained on this combined dataset using standard face recognition benchmarks and\ndemonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance across many of\nthese benchmarks.",

Training multimodal models to do the same, known as Visual\nChain of Thought (Visual CoT), is challenging due to: (1) poor off-the-shelf\nvisual CoT performance, which hinders reinforcement learning, and (2) the lack\nof high-quality visual CoT training data. We introduce $\\textbf{Zebra-CoT}$, a\ndiverse large-scale dataset with 182,384 samples, containing logically coherent\ninterleaved text-image reasoning traces. We focus on four categories of tasks\nwhere sketching or visual reasoning is especially natural, spanning scientific\nquestions such as geometry, physics, and algorithms; 2D visual reasoning tasks\nlike visual search and jigsaw puzzles; 3D reasoning tasks including 3D\nmulti-hop inference, embodied and robot planning; visual logic problems and\nstrategic games like chess. Fine-tuning the Anole-7B model on the Zebra-CoT\ntraining corpus results in an improvement of +12% in our test-set accuracy and\nyields up to +13% performance gain on standard VLM benchmark evaluations.\nFine-tuning Bagel-7B yields a model that generates high-quality interleaved\nvisual reasoning chains, underscoring Zebra-CoT's effectiveness for developing\nmultimodal reasoning abilities.

Retinex theory addresses\nthis by viewing an image S as the pixel-wise product of reflectance R and\nillumination I, mirroring the way people perceive stable object colors under\nchanging light. The decomposition is ill-posed, and classic Retinex models have\nfour key flaws: (i) they treat the red, green, and blue channels independently;\n(ii) they lack a neuroscientific model of color vision; (iii) they cannot\nperfectly rebuild the input image; and (iv) they do not explain human color\nconstancy. We introduce the first Quaternion Retinex formulation, in which the\nscene is written as the Hamilton product of quaternion-valued reflectance and\nillumination. To gauge how well reflectance stays invariant, we propose the\nReflectance Consistency Index. Tests on low-light crack inspection, face\ndetection under varied lighting, and infrared-visible fusion show gains of 2-11\npercent over leading methods, with better color fidelity, lower noise, and\nhigher reflectance stability.",

        "summary": "Deep learning has significantly advanced building segmentation in remote\nsensing, yet models struggle to generalize on data of diverse geographic\nregions due to variations in city layouts and the distribution of building\ntypes, sizes and locations. However, the amount of time-consuming annotated\ndata for capturing worldwide diversity may never catch up with the demands of\nincreasingly data-hungry models. Thus, we propose a novel approach: re-training\nmodels at test time using synthetic data tailored to the target region's city\nlayout. This method generates geo-typical synthetic data that closely\nreplicates the urban structure of a target area by leveraging geospatial data\nsuch as street network from OpenStreetMap. Using procedural modeling and\nphysics-based rendering, very high-resolution synthetic images are created,\nincorporating domain randomization in building shapes, materials, and\nenvironmental illumination. This enables the generation of virtually unlimited\ntraining samples that maintain the essential characteristics of the target\nenvironment. To overcome synthetic-to-real domain gaps, our approach integrates\ngeo-typical data into an adversarial domain adaptation framework for building\nsegmentation. Experiments demonstrate significant performance enhancements,\nwith median improvements of up to 12%, depending on the domain gap. This\nscalable and cost-effective method blends partial geographic knowledge with\nsynthetic imagery, providing a promising solution to the \"model collapse\" issue\nin purely synthetic datasets. It offers a practical pathway to improving\ngeneralization in remote sensing building segmentation without extensive\nreal-world annotations.",

Recent studies\nintegrated Local Attention Transformers with Mamba to capture both local\ndetails and global contexts. Despite competitive performance, these methods are\nlimited to simple stacking of Transformer and Mamba layers without any\ninteraction mechanism between them. Thus, deep integration between Transformer\nand Mamba layers remains an open problem. We address this problem by proposing\nA2Mamba, a powerful Transformer-Mamba hybrid network architecture, featuring a\nnew token mixer termed Multi-scale Attention-augmented State Space Model\n(MASS), where multi-scale attention maps are integrated into an\nattention-augmented SSM (A2SSM). A key step of A2SSM performs a variant of\ncross-attention by spatially aggregating the SSM's hidden states using the\nmulti-scale attention maps, which enhances spatial dependencies pertaining to a\ntwo-dimensional space while improving the dynamic modeling capabilities of\nSSMs. Our A2Mamba outperforms all previous ConvNet-, Transformer-, and\nMamba-based architectures in visual recognition tasks.

To explore further temporal deviation for weakly-supervised\nlearning, an extensible deviation perceiving loss has been proposed, aiming at\nenlarging the deviation of adjacent segments of the forged samples and reducing\nthat of genuine samples.

        "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown\nimpressive reasoning capabilities. However, further enhancing existing MLLMs\nnecessitates high-quality vision-language datasets with carefully curated task\ncomplexities, which are both costly and challenging to scale. Although recent\nself-improving models that iteratively refine themselves offer a feasible\nsolution, they still suffer from two core challenges: (i) most existing methods\naugment visual or textual data separately, resulting in discrepancies in data\ncomplexity (e.g., over-simplified diagrams paired with redundant textual\ndescriptions); and (ii) the evolution of data and models is also separated,\nleading to scenarios where models are exposed to tasks with mismatched\ndifficulty levels. To address these issues, we propose C2-Evo, an automatic,\nclosed-loop self-improving framework that jointly evolves both training data\nand model capabilities. Specifically, given a base dataset and a base model,\nC2-Evo enhances them by a cross-modal data evolution loop and a data-model\nevolution loop. The former loop expands the base dataset by generating complex\nmultimodal problems that combine structured textual sub-problems with\niteratively specified geometric diagrams, while the latter loop adaptively\nselects the generated problems based on the performance of the base model, to\nconduct supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning alternately.\nConsequently, our method continuously refines its model and training data, and\nconsistently obtains considerable performance gains across multiple\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks. Our code, models, and datasets will be\nreleased.",

        "title": "DenseSR: Image Shadow Removal as Dense Prediction",
        "summary": "Shadows are a common factor degrading image quality. Single-image shadow\nremoval (SR), particularly under challenging indirect illumination, is hampered\nby non-uniform content degradation and inherent ambiguity. Consequently,\ntraditional methods often fail to simultaneously recover intra-shadow details\nand maintain sharp boundaries, resulting in inconsistent restoration and\nblurring that negatively affect both downstream applications and the overall\nviewing experience. To overcome these limitations, we propose the DenseSR,\napproaching the problem from a dense prediction perspective to emphasize\nrestoration quality. This framework uniquely synergizes two key strategies: (1)\ndeep scene understanding guided by geometric-semantic priors to resolve\nambiguity and implicitly localize shadows, and (2) high-fidelity restoration\nvia a novel Dense Fusion Block (DFB) in the decoder. The DFB employs adaptive\ncomponent processing-using an Adaptive Content Smoothing Module (ACSM) for\nconsistent appearance and a Texture-Boundary Recuperation Module (TBRM) for\nfine textures and sharp boundaries-thereby directly tackling the inconsistent\nrestoration and blurring issues. These purposefully processed components are\neffectively fused, yielding an optimized feature representation preserving both\nconsistency and fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the merits\nof our approach over existing methods. Our code can be available on\nhttps://github$.$com/VanLinLin/DenseSR",

Semi-supervised medical image segmentation aims to leverage\nlimited annotated data alongside abundant unlabeled data to achieve accurate\nsegmentation. However, existing semi-supervised methods often struggle to\nstructure semantic distributions in the latent space due to noise introduced by\npseudo-labels. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based framework for\nsemi-supervised medical image segmentation. Our method introduces a constraint\ninto the latent structure of semantic labels during the denoising diffusion\nprocess by enforcing prototype-based contrastive consistency. Rather than\nexplicitly delineating semantic boundaries, the model leverages class\nprototypes centralized semantic representations in the latent space as anchors.\nThis strategy improves the robustness of dense predictions, particularly in the\npresence of noisy pseudo-labels. We also introduce a new publicly available\nbenchmark: Multi-Object Segmentation in X-ray Angiography Videos (MOSXAV),\nwhich provides detailed, manually annotated segmentation ground truth for\nmultiple anatomical structures in X-ray angiography videos. Extensive\nexperiments on the EndoScapes2023 and MOSXAV datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation approaches under\nthe semi-supervised learning setting.

        "title": "A High Magnifications Histopathology Image Dataset for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Diagnosis and Prognosis",
        "summary": "Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent and aggressive malignancy\nwhere deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis can enhance\nclinical assessments.However, existing publicly available OSCC datasets often\nsuffer from limited patient cohorts and a restricted focus on either diagnostic\nor prognostic tasks, limiting the development of comprehensive and\ngeneralizable models. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-OSCC, a new\nhistopathology image dataset comprising 1,325 OSCC patients, integrating both\ndiagnostic and prognostic information to expand existing public resources. Each\npatient is represented by six high resolution histopathology images captured at\nx200, x400, and x1000 magnifications-two per magnification-covering both the\ncore and edge tumor regions.The Multi-OSCC dataset is richly annotated for six\ncritical clinical tasks: recurrence prediction (REC), lymph node metastasis\n(LNM), tumor differentiation (TD), tumor invasion (TI), cancer embolus (CE),\nand perineural invasion (PI). To benchmark this dataset, we systematically\nevaluate the impact of different visual encoders, multi-image fusion\ntechniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks. Our\nanalysis yields several key insights: (1) The top-performing models achieve\nexcellent results, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 94.72% for REC and\n81.23% for TD, while all tasks surpass 70% AUC; (2) Stain normalization\nbenefits diagnostic tasks but negatively affects recurrence prediction; (3)\nMulti-task learning incurs a 3.34% average AUC degradation compared to\nsingle-task models in our multi-task benchmark, underscoring the challenge of\nbalancing multiple tasks in our dataset. To accelerate future research, we\npublicly release the Multi-OSCC dataset and baseline models at\nhttps://github.com/guanjinquan/OSCC-PathologyImageDataset.",

        "summary": "Face reenactment aims to generate realistic talking head videos by\ntransferring motion from a driving video to a static source image while\npreserving the source identity. Although existing methods based on either\nimplicit or explicit keypoints have shown promise, they struggle with large\npose variations due to warping artifacts or the limitations of coarse facial\nlandmarks. In this paper, we present the Face Reenactment Video Diffusion model\n(FRVD), a novel framework for high-fidelity face reenactment under large pose\nchanges. Our method first employs a motion extractor to extract implicit facial\nkeypoints from the source and driving images to represent fine-grained motion\nand to perform motion alignment through a warping module. To address the\ndegradation introduced by warping, we introduce a Warping Feature Mapper (WFM)\nthat maps the warped source image into the motion-aware latent space of a\npretrained image-to-video (I2V) model. This latent space encodes rich priors of\nfacial dynamics learned from large-scale video data, enabling effective warping\ncorrection and enhancing temporal coherence. Extensive experiments show that\nFRVD achieves superior performance over existing methods in terms of pose\naccuracy, identity preservation, and visual quality, especially in challenging\nscenarios with extreme pose variations.",

However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic\npretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven\nunlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,\nthey are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal\nthat state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even\nwhen fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this\npaper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced\nresilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning\nas an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,\nResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of\nharmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to\nsimulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve\ngeneralization.

The scarcity of\ntraining data has driven recent efforts to incorporate additional modalities,\nparticularly text. However, the subtle variations in human posture, motion\ndynamics, and the object interactions that occur during different phases, are\ncritical inherent knowledge of actions that cannot be fully exploited by action\nlabels alone. In this work, we propose Language-Guided Action Anatomy (LGA), a\nnovel framework that goes beyond label semantics by leveraging Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to dissect the essential representational characteristics hidden\nbeneath action labels. Guided by the prior knowledge encoded in LLM, LGA\neffectively captures rich spatiotemporal cues in few-shot scenarios.\nSpecifically, for text, we prompt an off-the-shelf LLM to anatomize labels into\nsequences of atomic action descriptions, focusing on the three core elements of\naction (subject, motion, object). For videos, a Visual Anatomy Module segments\nactions into atomic video phases to capture the sequential structure of\nactions. A fine-grained fusion strategy then integrates textual and visual\nfeatures at the atomic level, resulting in more generalizable prototypes.\nFinally, we introduce a Multimodal Matching mechanism, comprising both\nvideo-video and video-text matching, to ensure robust few-shot classification.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LGA achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross multipe FSAR benchmarks.",

        "summary": "Deep learning typically relies on end-to-end backpropagation for training, a\nmethod that inherently suffers from issues such as update locking during\nparameter optimization, high GPU memory consumption, and a lack of biological\nplausibility. In contrast, supervised local learning seeks to mitigate these\nchallenges by partitioning the network into multiple local blocks and designing\nindependent auxiliary networks to update each block separately. However,\nbecause gradients are propagated solely within individual local blocks,\nperformance degradation occurs, preventing supervised local learning from\nsupplanting end-to-end backpropagation. To address these limitations and\nfacilitate inter-block information flow, we propose the Momentum Auxiliary\nNetwork++ (MAN++). MAN++ introduces a dynamic interaction mechanism by\nemploying the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of parameters from adjacent\nblocks to enhance communication across the network. The auxiliary network,\nupdated via EMA, effectively bridges the information gap between blocks.\nNotably, we observed that directly applying EMA parameters can be suboptimal\ndue to feature discrepancies between local blocks. To resolve this issue, we\nintroduce a learnable scaling bias that balances feature differences, thereby\nfurther improving performance. We validate MAN++ through extensive experiments\non tasks that include image classification, object detection, and image\nsegmentation, utilizing multiple network architectures. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that MAN++ achieves performance comparable to end-to-end\ntraining while significantly reducing GPU memory usage. Consequently, MAN++\noffers a novel perspective for supervised local learning and presents a viable\nalternative to conventional training methods.",

Token reduction, which discards\nless important tokens during forward propagation, has been proposed to enhance\nthe efficiency of transformer models. However, existing methods handle\nunimportant tokens irreversibly, preventing their reuse in subsequent blocks.\nConsidering that transformers focus on different information among blocks,\ntokens reduced in early blocks might be useful later. Furthermore, to adapt\ntransformer models for resource-constrained devices, it is crucial to strike a\nbalance between model performance and computational overhead. To address these\nchallenges, in this paper, we introduce a novel Token Freezing and Reusing\n(ToFe) framework, where we identify important tokens at each stage and\ntemporarily freeze the unimportant ones, allowing their lagged reusing at a\nlater stage. Specifically, we design a prediction module for token\nidentification and an approximate module for recovery of the frozen tokens. By\njointly optimizing with the backbone through computation budget-aware\nend-to-end training, ToFe can adaptively process the necessary tokens at each\nblock, thereby reducing computational cost while maintaining performance.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ToFe reduces the computational cost of\nLV-ViT model by 50% with less than 2% drop in Top-1 accuracy, achieving a\nbetter trade-off between performance and complexity compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

However, existing adversarial\ntraining (AT) methods for robust fine-tuning largely overlook the role of\nlanguage in enhancing visual robustness. Specifically, (1) supervised AT\nmethods rely on short texts (e.g., class labels) to generate adversarial\nperturbations, leading to overfitting to object classes in the training data,\nand (2) unsupervised AT avoids this overfitting but remains suboptimal against\npractical text-guided adversarial attacks due to its lack of semantic guidance.\nTo address these limitations, we propose Quality Text-guided Adversarial\nFine-Tuning (QT-AFT), which leverages high-quality captions during training to\nguide adversarial examples away from diverse semantics present in images. This\nenables the visual encoder to robustly recognize a broader range of image\nfeatures even under adversarial noise, thereby enhancing robustness across\ndiverse downstream tasks. QT-AFT overcomes the key weaknesses of prior methods\n-- overfitting in supervised AT and lack of semantic awareness in unsupervised\nAT -- achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot adversarial robustness and clean\naccuracy, evaluated across 16 zero-shot datasets. Furthermore, our\ncomprehensive study uncovers several key insights into the role of language in\nenhancing vision robustness; for example, describing object properties in\naddition to object names further enhances zero-shot robustness.

        "summary": "Recent advancements in unified image generation models, such as OmniGen, have\nenabled the handling of diverse image generation and editing tasks within a\nsingle framework, accepting multimodal, interleaved texts and images in free\nform. This unified architecture eliminates the need for text encoders, greatly\nreducing model complexity and standardizing various image generation and\nediting tasks, making it more user-friendly. However, we found that it suffers\nfrom text instruction neglect, especially when the text instruction contains\nmultiple sub-instructions. To explore this issue, we performed a perturbation\nanalysis on the input to identify critical steps and layers. By examining the\ncross-attention maps of these key steps, we observed significant conflicts\nbetween neglected sub-instructions and the activations of the input image. In\nresponse, we propose Self-Adaptive Attention Scaling (SaaS), a method that\nleverages the consistency of cross-attention between adjacent timesteps to\ndynamically scale the attention activation for each sub-instruction. Our SaaS\nenhances instruction-following fidelity without requiring additional training\nor test-time optimization. Experimental results on instruction-based image\nediting and visual conditional image generation validate the effectiveness of\nour SaaS, showing superior instruction-following fidelity over existing\nmethods.

Existing\nmethods mainly improve the diversity of samples through style transformation,\nwhich to some extent enhances the generalization performance of the model.\nHowever, we discover that not all styles contribute to the generalization\nperformance. Therefore, we define styles that are beneficial or harmful to the\nmodel's generalization performance as positive or negative styles. Based on\nthis, new issues arise: How to effectively screen and continuously utilize the\npositive styles. To solve these problems, we propose a Style Screening and\nContinuous Utilization (SSCU) framework. Firstly, we design a Generalization\nGain-guided Dynamic Style Memory (GGDSM) for each client model to screen and\naccumulate generated positive styles. Meanwhile, we propose a style memory\nrecognition loss to fully leverage the positive styles memorized by Memory.\nFurthermore, we propose a Collaborative Style Training (CST) strategy to make\nfull use of positive styles. Unlike traditional learning strategies, our\napproach leverages both newly generated styles and the accumulated positive\nstyles stored in memory to train client models on two distinct branches. This\ntraining strategy is designed to effectively promote the rapid acquisition of\nnew styles by the client models, and guarantees the continuous and thorough\nutilization of positive styles, which is highly beneficial for the model's\ngeneralization performance.

        "summary": "Recently, a novel visual state space (VSS) model, referred to as Mamba, has\ndemonstrated significant progress in modeling long sequences with linear\ncomplexity, comparable to Transformer models, thereby enhancing its\nadaptability for processing visual data. Although most methods aim to enhance\nthe global receptive field by directly modifying Mamba's scanning mechanism,\nthey tend to overlook the critical importance of local information in dense\nprediction tasks. Additionally, whether Mamba can effectively extract local\nfeatures as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) do remains an open question\nthat merits further investigation. In this paper, We propose a novel model,\nAtrousMamba, which effectively balances the extraction of fine-grained local\ndetails with the integration of global contextual information. Specifically,\nour method incorporates an atrous-window selective scan mechanism, enabling a\ngradual expansion of the scanning range with adjustable rates. This design\nshortens the distance between adjacent tokens, enabling the model to\neffectively capture fine-grained local features and global context. By\nleveraging the atrous window scan visual state space (AWVSS) module, we design\ndedicated end-to-end Mamba-based frameworks for binary change detection (BCD)\nand semantic change detection (SCD), referred to as AWMambaBCD and AWMambaSCD,\nrespectively. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets show that the\nproposed framework outperforms existing CNN-based, Transformer-based, and\nMamba-based methods. These findings clearly demonstrate that Mamba not only\ncaptures long-range dependencies in visual data but also effectively preserves\nfine-grained local details.",

However,\nintegrating RGB and DSM often faces two major limitations: increased\ncomputational complexity due to architectural redundancy, and degraded\nsegmentation performance caused by modality misalignment. These issues\nundermine the efficiency and robustness of semantic segmentation, particularly\nin complex urban environments where precise multi-modal integration is\nessential. To overcome these limitations, we propose Asymmetric Multi-Modal\nNetwork (AMMNet), a novel asymmetric architecture that achieves robust and\nefficient semantic segmentation through three designs tailored for RGB-DSM\ninput pairs. To reduce architectural redundancy, the Asymmetric Dual Encoder\n(ADE) module assigns representational capacity based on modality-specific\ncharacteristics, employing a deeper encoder for RGB imagery to capture rich\ncontextual information and a lightweight encoder for DSM to extract sparse\nstructural features. Besides, to facilitate modality alignment, the Asymmetric\nPrior Fuser (APF) integrates a modality-aware prior matrix into the fusion\nprocess, enabling the generation of structure-aware contextual features.\nAdditionally, the Distribution Alignment (DA) module enhances cross-modal\ncompatibility by aligning feature distributions through divergence\nminimization.

        "summary": "Personalized image generation, where reference images of one or more subjects\nare used to generate their image according to a scene description, has gathered\nsignificant interest in the community. However, such generated images suffer\nfrom three major limitations -- complex activities, such as $<$man, pushing,\nmotorcycle$>$ are not generated properly with incorrect human poses, reference\nhuman identities are not preserved, and generated human gaze patterns are\nunnatural/inconsistent with the scene description. In this work, we propose to\novercome these shortcomings through feedback-based fine-tuning of existing\npersonalized generation methods, wherein, state-of-art detectors of pose,\nhuman-object-interaction, human facial recognition and human gaze-point\nestimation are used to refine the diffusion model. We also propose\ntimestep-based inculcation of different feedback modules, depending upon\nwhether the signal is low-level (such as human pose), or high-level (such as\ngaze point). The images generated in this manner show an improvement in the\ngenerated interactions, facial identities and image quality over three\nbenchmark datasets.",

        "summary": "User privacy in mobile robotics has become a critical concern. Existing\nmethods typically prioritize either the performance of downstream robotic tasks\nor privacy protection, with the latter often constraining the effectiveness of\ntask execution. To jointly address both objectives, we study semantic-based\nrobot navigation in an ultra-low-resolution setting to preserve visual privacy.\nA key challenge in such scenarios is recovering semantic segmentation from\nultra-low-resolution RGB images. In this work, we introduce a novel fully\njoint-learning method that integrates an agglomerative feature extractor and a\nsegmentation-aware discriminator to solve ultra-low-resolution semantic\nsegmentation, thereby enabling privacy-preserving, semantic object-goal\nnavigation. Our method outperforms different baselines on ultra-low-resolution\nsemantic segmentation and our improved segmentation results increase the\nsuccess rate of the semantic object-goal navigation in a real-world\nprivacy-constrained scenario.",

In contrast, this\npaper introduces a novel approach to the person-to-person try-on task. Unlike\nthe garment-to-person try-on task, the person-to-person task only involves two\ninput images: one depicting the target person and the other showing the garment\nworn by a different individual. The goal is to generate a realistic combination\nof the target person with the desired garment. To this end, we propose\nFlattening-and-Warping Virtual Try-On (\\textbf{FW-VTON}), a method that\noperates in three stages: (1) extracting the flattened garment image from the\nsource image; (2) warping the garment to align with the target pose; and (3)\nintegrating the warped garment seamlessly onto the target person. To overcome\nthe challenges posed by the lack of high-quality datasets for this task, we\nintroduce a new dataset specifically designed for person-to-person try-on\nscenarios.

        "summary": "Face image quality plays a critical role in determining the accuracy and\nreliability of face verification systems, particularly in real-time screening\napplications such as surveillance, identity verification, and access control.\nLow-quality face images, often caused by factors such as motion blur, poor\nlighting conditions, occlusions, and extreme pose variations, significantly\ndegrade the performance of face recognition models, leading to higher false\nrejection and false acceptance rates. In this work, we propose a lightweight\nyet effective framework for automatic face quality assessment, which aims to\npre-filter low-quality face images before they are passed to the verification\npipeline. Our approach utilises normalised facial landmarks in conjunction with\na Random Forest Regression classifier to assess image quality, achieving an\naccuracy of 96.67\\%. By integrating this quality assessment module into the\nface verification process, we observe a substantial improvement in performance,\nincluding a comfortable 99.7\\% reduction in the false rejection rate and\nenhanced cosine similarity scores when paired with the ArcFace face\nverification model. To validate our approach, we have conducted experiments on\na real-world dataset collected comprising over 600 subjects captured from CCTV\nfootage in unconstrained environments within Dubai Police. Our results\ndemonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates the impact of\npoor-quality face images, outperforming existing face quality assessment\ntechniques while maintaining computational efficiency. Moreover, the framework\nspecifically addresses two critical challenges in real-time screening:\nvariations in face resolution and pose deviations, both of which are prevalent\nin practical surveillance scenarios.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in dense 3D reconstruction have led to significant progress,\nyet achieving accurate unified geometric prediction remains a major challenge.\nMost existing methods are limited to predicting a single geometry quantity from\ninput images. However, geometric quantities such as depth, surface normals, and\npoint maps are inherently correlated, and estimating them in isolation often\nfails to ensure consistency, thereby limiting both accuracy and practical\napplicability. This motivates us to explore a unified framework that explicitly\nmodels the structural coupling among different geometric properties to enable\njoint regression. In this paper, we present Dens3R, a 3D foundation model\ndesigned for joint geometric dense prediction and adaptable to a wide range of\ndownstream tasks. Dens3R adopts a two-stage training framework to progressively\nbuild a pointmap representation that is both generalizable and intrinsically\ninvariant. Specifically, we design a lightweight shared encoder-decoder\nbackbone and introduce position-interpolated rotary positional encoding to\nmaintain expressive power while enhancing robustness to high-resolution inputs.\nBy integrating image-pair matching features with intrinsic invariance modeling,\nDens3R accurately regresses multiple geometric quantities such as surface\nnormals and depth, achieving consistent geometry perception from single-view to\nmulti-view inputs. Additionally, we propose a post-processing pipeline that\nsupports geometrically consistent multi-view inference. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superior performance of Dens3R across various dense 3D\nprediction tasks and highlight its potential for broader applications.",

MRI inherently contains both spatial\nand frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain\nand reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most\nexisting AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting\ntheir capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the\ndisease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information,\nthey are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain\nanalysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose\nSpatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework\nthat simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to\nenhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense\nconvolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency\nmodule to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a\nnovel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial\nfeature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging\nInitiative (ANDI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines\nand reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and\nAD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.",

Among them, feature-level attacks, where\nintermediate features are perturbed based on feature importance weight matrix\ncomputed from transformed images, have gained popularity. In this work, we find\nthat existing feature-level attacks primarily manipulate the semantic\ninformation to derive the weight matrix. Inspired by several works that find\nCNNs tend to focus more on high-frequency components (a.k.a. abstract features,\ne.g., texture, edge, etc.), we validate that transforming images in the\nhigh-frequency space also improves transferability. Based on this finding, we\npropose a balanced approach called Semantic and Abstract FEatures disRuption\n(SAFER). Specifically, SAFER conducts BLOCKMIX on the input image and SELF-MIX\non the frequency spectrum when computing the weight matrix to highlight crucial\nfeatures. By using such a weight matrix, we can direct the attacker to disrupt\nboth semantic and abstract features, leading to improved transferability.\nExtensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset also demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method in boosting adversarial transferability.",

We introduce QANA, a novel\nquantization-aware neuromorphic architecture for incremental skin lesion\nclassification on resource-limited hardware. QANA effectively integrates ghost\nmodules, efficient channel attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for\nrobust feature representation with low-latency and energy-efficient inference.\nIts quantization-aware head and spike-compatible transformations enable\nseamless conversion to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deployment on\nneuromorphic platforms. Evaluation on the large-scale HAM10000 benchmark and a\nreal-world clinical dataset shows that QANA achieves 91.6\\% Top-1 accuracy and\n82.4\\% macro F1 on HAM10000, and 90.8\\% / 81.7\\% on the clinical dataset,\nsignificantly outperforming state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN models under fair\ncomparison. Deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, QANA achieves 1.5\\,ms\ninference latency and 1.7\\,mJ energy per image, reducing inference latency and\nenergy use by over 94.6\\%/98.6\\% compared to GPU-based CNNs surpassing\nstate-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN conversion baselines.

B-cos\nnetworks offer a promising solution by replacing standard linear layers with a\nweight-input alignment mechanism, producing inherently interpretable,\nclass-specific explanations without post-hoc methods.

Yet, many applications\nremain largely inaccessible due to incomplete or missing metadata provided by\ndevelopers - our investigation shows that only 33% of applications on macOS\noffer full accessibility support. While recent work on structured screen\nrepresentation has primarily addressed specific challenges, such as UI element\ndetection or captioning, none has attempted to capture the full complexity of\ndesktop interfaces by replicating their entire hierarchical structure. To\nbridge this gap, we introduce Screen2AX, the first framework to automatically\ncreate real-time, tree-structured accessibility metadata from a single\nscreenshot. Our method uses vision-language and object detection models to\ndetect, describe, and organize UI elements hierarchically, mirroring macOS's\nsystem-level accessibility structure. To tackle the limited availability of\ndata for macOS desktop applications, we compiled and publicly released three\ndatasets encompassing 112 macOS applications, each annotated for UI element\ndetection, grouping, and hierarchical accessibility metadata alongside\ncorresponding screenshots. Screen2AX accurately infers hierarchy trees,\nachieving a 77% F1 score in reconstructing a complete accessibility tree.\nCrucially, these hierarchy trees improve the ability of autonomous agents to\ninterpret and interact with complex desktop interfaces. We introduce\nScreen2AX-Task, a benchmark specifically designed for evaluating autonomous\nagent task execution in macOS desktop environments.

While dynamic cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) can capture\ndetailed tissue motion throughout the cardiac cycle, the fine-grained 4D\ncardiac motion tracking remains challenging due to the homogeneous nature of\nmyocardial tissue and the lack of distinctive features. Existing approaches can\nbe broadly categorized into image based and representation-based, each with its\nlimitations. Image-based methods, including both raditional and deep\nlearning-based registration approaches, either struggle with topological\nconsistency or rely heavily on extensive training data. Representation-based\nmethods, while promising, often suffer from loss of image-level details. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Dynamic 3D Gaussian Representation\n(Dyna3DGR), a novel framework that combines explicit 3D Gaussian representation\nwith implicit neural motion field modeling. Our method simultaneously optimizes\ncardiac structure and motion in a self-supervised manner, eliminating the need\nfor extensive training data or point-to-point correspondences. Through\ndifferentiable volumetric rendering, Dyna3DGR efficiently bridges continuous\nmotion representation with image-space alignment while preserving both\ntopological and temporal consistency. Comprehensive evaluations on the ACDC\ndataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art deep\nlearning-based diffeomorphic registration methods in tracking accuracy.

In this work, we propose a lightweight, unified network\nnamed LPTR-AFLNet for correcting and recognizing Chinese license plates, which\ncombines a perspective transformation correction module (PTR) with an optimized\nlicense plate recognition network, AFLNet. The network leverages the\nrecognition output as a weak supervisory signal to effectively guide the\ncorrection process, ensuring accurate perspective distortion correction. To\nenhance recognition accuracy, we introduce several improvements to LPRNet,\nincluding an improved attention module to reduce confusion among similar\ncharacters and the use of Focal Loss to address class imbalance during\ntraining. Experimental results demonstrate the exceptional performance of\nLPTR-AFLNet in rectifying perspective distortion and recognizing double-line\nlicense plate images, maintaining high recognition accuracy across various\nchallenging scenarios.

        "summary": "Distortion of the fingerprint images leads to a decline in fingerprint\nrecognition performance, and fingerprint registration can mitigate this\ndistortion issue by accurately aligning two fingerprint images. Currently,\nfingerprint registration methods often consist of two steps: an initial\nregistration based on minutiae, and a dense registration based on matching\npoints. However, when the quality of fingerprint image is low, the number of\ndetected minutiae is reduced, leading to frequent failures in the initial\nregistration, which ultimately causes the entire fingerprint registration\nprocess to fail. In this study, we propose an end-to-end single-step\nfingerprint registration algorithm that aligns two fingerprints by directly\npredicting the semi-dense matching points correspondences between two\nfingerprints. Thus, our method minimizes the risk of minutiae registration\nfailure and also leverages global-local attentions to achieve end-to-end\npixel-level alignment between the two fingerprints. Experiment results prove\nthat our method can achieve the state-of-the-art matching performance with only\nsingle-step registration, and it can also be used in conjunction with dense\nregistration algorithms for further performance improvements.",

        "summary": "Contextual reasoning with constraints is crucial for enhancing temporal\nconsistency in cross-frame modeling for visual tracking. However, mainstream\ntracking algorithms typically associate context by merely stacking historical\ninformation without explicitly supervising the association process, making it\ndifficult to effectively model the target's evolving dynamics. To alleviate\nthis problem, we propose RSTrack, which explicitly models and supervises\ncontext reasoning via three core mechanisms. \\textit{1) Context Reasoning\nMechanism}: Constructs a target state reasoning pipeline, converting\nunconstrained contextual associations into a temporal reasoning process that\npredicts the current representation based on historical target states, thereby\nenhancing temporal consistency. \\textit{2) Forward Supervision Strategy}:\nUtilizes true target features as anchors to constrain the reasoning pipeline,\nguiding the predicted output toward the true target distribution and\nsuppressing drift in the context reasoning process. \\textit{3) Efficient State\nModeling}: Employs a compression-reconstruction mechanism to extract the core\nfeatures of the target, removing redundant information across frames and\npreventing ineffective contextual associations. These three mechanisms\ncollaborate to effectively alleviate the issue of contextual association\ndivergence in traditional temporal modeling. Experimental results show that\nRSTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets\nwhile maintaining real-time running speeds.

        "summary": "Quantization is a key technique to reduce network size and computational\ncomplexity by representing the network parameters with a lower precision.\nTraditional quantization methods rely on access to original training data,\nwhich is often restricted due to privacy concerns or security challenges.\nZero-shot Quantization (ZSQ) addresses this by using synthetic data generated\nfrom pre-trained models, eliminating the need for real training data. Recently,\nZSQ has been extended to object detection. However, existing methods use\nunlabeled task-agnostic synthetic images that lack the specific information\nrequired for object detection, leading to suboptimal performance. In this\npaper, we propose a novel task-specific ZSQ framework for object detection\nnetworks, which consists of two main stages. First, we introduce a bounding box\nand category sampling strategy to synthesize a task-specific calibration set\nfrom the pre-trained network, reconstructing object locations, sizes, and\ncategory distributions without any prior knowledge. Second, we integrate\ntask-specific training into the knowledge distillation process to restore the\nperformance of quantized detection networks.

However, compared to features in conventional\nphotographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due\nto the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These\nchallenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of\nannotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning\nmodel performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we\nexamined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for\nnatural images.\n  We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization,\nsemantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable\ncues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement\ncannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which\ncan be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we\nintroduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation\naccuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we\nfound that our approach led to a 57% improvement in defect detection rate,\nwhich is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset\nused in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only\nachieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers.",

        "summary": "Conventional approaches to video segmentation are confined to predefined\nobject categories and cannot identify out-of-vocabulary objects, let alone\nobjects that are not identified explicitly but only referred to implicitly in\ncomplex text queries. This shortcoming limits the utility for video\nsegmentation in complex and variable scenarios, where a closed set of object\ncategories is difficult to define and where users may not know the exact object\ncategory that will appear in the video. Such scenarios can arise in operating\nroom video analysis, where different health systems may use different workflows\nand instrumentation, requiring flexible solutions for video analysis. Reasoning\nsegmentation (RS) now offers promise towards such a solution, enabling natural\nlanguage text queries as interaction for identifying object to segment.\nHowever, existing video RS formulation assume that target objects remain\ncontextually relevant throughout entire video sequences. This assumption is\ninadequate for real-world scenarios in which objects of interest appear,\ndisappear or change relevance dynamically based on temporal context, such as\nsurgical instruments that become relevant only during specific procedural\nphases or anatomical structures that gain importance at particular moments\nduring surgery. Our first contribution is the introduction of\ntemporally-constrained video reasoning segmentation, a novel task formulation\nthat requires models to implicitly infer when target objects become\ncontextually relevant based on text queries that incorporate temporal\nreasoning. Since manual annotation of temporally-constrained video RS datasets\nwould be expensive and limit scalability, our second contribution is an\ninnovative automated benchmark construction method. Finally, we present\nTCVideoRSBenchmark, a temporally-constrained video RS dataset containing 52\nsamples using the videos from the MVOR dataset.",

        "summary": "The advancement of image editing tools has enabled malicious manipulation of\nsensitive document images, underscoring the need for robust document image\nforgery detection.Though forgery detectors for natural images have been\nextensively studied, they struggle with document images, as the tampered\nregions can be seamlessly blended into the uniform document background (BG) and\nstructured text. On the other hand, existing document-specific methods lack\nsufficient robustness against various degradations, which limits their\npractical deployment. This paper presents ADCD-Net, a robust document forgery\nlocalization model that adaptively leverages the RGB/DCT forensic traces and\nintegrates key characteristics of document images. Specifically, to address the\nDCT traces' sensitivity to block misalignment, we adaptively modulate the DCT\nfeature contribution based on a predicted alignment score, resulting in much\nimproved resilience to various distortions, including resizing and cropping.\nAlso, a hierarchical content disentanglement approach is proposed to boost the\nlocalization performance via mitigating the text-BG disparities. Furthermore,\nnoticing the predominantly pristine nature of BG regions, we construct a\npristine prototype capturing traces of untampered regions, and eventually\nenhance both the localization accuracy and robustness. Our proposed ADCD-Net\ndemonstrates superior forgery localization performance, consistently\noutperforming state-of-the-art methods by 20.79\\% averaged over 5 types of\ndistortions.

        "summary": "This work tackles the problem of Online detection of Take and Release (OTR)\nof an object in untrimmed egocentric videos. This task is challenging due to\nsevere label imbalance, with temporally sparse positive annotations, and the\nneed for precise temporal predictions. Furthermore, methods need to be\ncomputationally efficient in order to be deployed in real-world online\nsettings. To address these challenges, we propose Mamba-OTR, a model based on\nthe Mamba architecture. Mamba-OTR is designed to exploit temporal recurrence\nduring inference while being trained on short video clips. To address label\nimbalance, our training pipeline incorporates the focal loss and a novel\nregularization scheme that aligns model predictions with the evaluation metric.\nExtensive experiments on EPIC-KITCHENS-100, the comparisons with\ntransformer-based approach, and the evaluation of different training and test\nschemes demonstrate the superiority of Mamba-OTR in both accuracy and\nefficiency. These finding are particularly evident when evaluating full-length\nvideos or high frame-rate sequences, even when trained on short video snippets\nfor computational convenience. The proposed Mamba-OTR achieves a noteworthy\nmp-mAP of 45.48 when operating in a sliding-window fashion, and 43.35 in\nstreaming mode, versus the 20.32 of a vanilla transformer and 25.16 of a\nvanilla Mamba, thus providing a strong baseline for OTR.

        "summary": "Polyp segmentation is vital for early colorectal cancer detection, yet\ntraditional fully supervised methods struggle with morphological variability\nand domain shifts, requiring frequent retraining. Additionally, reliance on\nlarge-scale annotations is a major bottleneck due to the time-consuming and\nerror-prone nature of polyp boundary labeling. Recently, vision foundation\nmodels like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have demonstrated strong\ngeneralizability and fine-grained boundary detection with sparse prompts,\neffectively addressing key polyp segmentation challenges. However, SAM's\nprompt-dependent nature limits automation in medical applications, since\nmanually inputting prompts for each image is labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming. We propose OP-SAM, a One-shot Polyp segmentation framework\nbased on SAM that automatically generates prompts from a single annotated\nimage, ensuring accurate and generalizable segmentation without additional\nannotation burdens. Our method introduces Correlation-based Prior Generation\n(CPG) for semantic label transfer and Scale-cascaded Prior Fusion (SPF) to\nadapt to polyp size variations as well as filter out noisy transfers. Instead\nof dumping all prompts at once, we devise Euclidean Prompt Evolution (EPE) for\niterative prompt refinement, progressively enhancing segmentation quality.\nExtensive evaluations across five datasets validate OP-SAM's effectiveness.\nNotably, on Kvasir, it achieves 76.93% IoU, surpassing the state-of-the-art by\n11.44%.",

Third, we show that over-parameterization\nprovides a significant advantage in robustness against input corruption.\nInterpretability analysis via saliency maps further confirms that these\nidentified sparse subnetworks preserve the core reasoning process of the\noriginal dense models.

Combining advanced computer\nalgorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the\nreliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale\nand RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly\nregarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in\nHSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict\nconstraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the\nshift of ML workloads to edge platforms.

        "title": "Are Foundation Models All You Need for Zero-shot Face Presentation Attack Detection?",
        "summary": "Although face recognition systems have undergone an impressive evolution in\nthe last decade, these technologies are vulnerable to attack presentations\n(AP). These attacks are mostly easy to create and, by executing them against\nthe system's capture device, the malicious actor can impersonate an authorised\nsubject and thus gain access to the latter's information (e.g., financial\ntransactions). To protect facial recognition schemes against presentation\nattacks, state-of-the-art deep learning presentation attack detection (PAD)\napproaches require a large amount of data to produce reliable detection\nperformances and even then, they decrease their performance for unknown\npresentation attack instruments (PAI) or database (information not seen during\ntraining), i.e. they lack generalisability. To mitigate the above problems,\nthis paper focuses on zero-shot PAD. To do so, we first assess the\neffectiveness and generalisability of foundation models in established and\nchallenging experimental scenarios and then propose a simple but effective\nframework for zero-shot PAD. Experimental results show that these models are\nable to achieve performance in difficult scenarios with minimal effort of the\nmore advanced PAD mechanisms, whose weights were optimised mainly with training\nsets that included APs and bona fide presentations. The top-performing\nfoundation model outperforms by a margin the best from the state of the art\nobserved with the leaving-one-out protocol on the SiW-Mv2 database, which\ncontains challenging unknown 2D and 3D attacks",

        "summary": "In an era where wearable technology is reshaping applications, Scene Text\nDetection and Recognition (STDR) becomes a straightforward choice through the\nlens of egocentric vision. Leveraging Meta's Project Aria smart glasses, this\npaper investigates how environmental variables, such as lighting, distance, and\nresolution, affect the performance of state-of-the-art STDR algorithms in\nreal-world scenarios. We introduce a novel, custom-built dataset captured under\ncontrolled conditions and evaluate two OCR pipelines: EAST with CRNN, and EAST\nwith PyTesseract. Our findings reveal that resolution and distance\nsignificantly influence recognition accuracy, while lighting plays a less\npredictable role. Notably, image upscaling emerged as a key pre-processing\ntechnique, reducing Character Error Rate (CER) from 0.65 to 0.48. We further\ndemonstrate the potential of integrating eye-gaze tracking to optimise\nprocessing efficiency by focusing on user attention zones. This work not only\nbenchmarks STDR performance under realistic conditions but also lays the\ngroundwork for adaptive, user-aware AR systems. Our contributions aim to\ninspire future research in robust, context-sensitive text recognition for\nassistive and research-oriented applications, such as asset inspection and\nnutrition analysis.

        "summary": "Perception is a fundamental task in the field of computer vision,\nencompassing a diverse set of subtasks that can be systematically categorized\ninto four distinct groups based on two dimensions: prediction type and\ninstruction type. Notably, existing researches often focus solely on a limited\nsubset of these potential combinations, which constrains their applicability\nand versatility across various contexts. In response to this challenge, we\npresent MVP-LM, a Multi-granular and Versatile Perception framework\nincorporating Visual Large Language Model. Our framework is designed to\nintegrate both word-based and sentence-based perception tasks alongside box and\nmask predictions within a single architecture. MVP-LM features an innovative\nmulti-granularity decoder in conjunction with a CoT-inspired dataset\nunification strategy, enabling seamless supervised fine-tuning across a wide\nspectrum of tasks, including but not limited to panoptic segmentation,\ndetection, grounding, and referring expression segmentation. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a query enhancement strategy aimed at harnessing the decoding and\ngenerative capabilities inherent in VLLMs. Extensive experiments conducted\nacross a range of benchmarks in both word-based and sentence-based perception\ntasks substantiate the efficacy of our framework.

        "title": "Benchmarking pig detection and tracking under diverse and challenging conditions",
        "summary": "To ensure animal welfare and effective management in pig farming, monitoring\nindividual behavior is a crucial prerequisite. While monitoring tasks have\ntraditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made\nit possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated\nway. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space\n(object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research\nof these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet\nbeen conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets:\nPigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The\ndatasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn\nconditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad\nvisibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images\nimprove detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled\nimages alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art\nmodels offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time\nalternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods\nachieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models.\nHowever, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they\ncould become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate\ncharacteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for\nfuture improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets\nperform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This\nhighlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and\nresearch code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use\nand further development.",

        "summary": "To understand and identify the unprecedented risks posed by rapidly advancing\nartificial intelligence (AI) models, this report presents a comprehensive\nassessment of their frontier risks. Drawing on the E-T-C analysis (deployment\nenvironment, threat source, enabling capability) from the Frontier AI Risk\nManagement Framework (v1.0) (SafeWork-F1-Framework), we identify critical risks\nin seven areas: cyber offense, biological and chemical risks, persuasion and\nmanipulation, uncontrolled autonomous AI R\\&D, strategic deception and\nscheming, self-replication, and collusion. Guided by the \"AI-$45^\\circ$ Law,\"\nwe evaluate these risks using \"red lines\" (intolerable thresholds) and \"yellow\nlines\" (early warning indicators) to define risk zones: green (manageable risk\nfor routine deployment and continuous monitoring), yellow (requiring\nstrengthened mitigations and controlled deployment), and red (necessitating\nsuspension of development and/or deployment). Experimental results show that\nall recent frontier AI models reside in green and yellow zones, without\ncrossing red lines. Specifically, no evaluated models cross the yellow line for\ncyber offense or uncontrolled AI R\\&D risks. For self-replication, and\nstrategic deception and scheming, most models remain in the green zone, except\nfor certain reasoning models in the yellow zone. In persuasion and\nmanipulation, most models are in the yellow zone due to their effective\ninfluence on humans. For biological and chemical risks, we are unable to rule\nout the possibility of most models residing in the yellow zone, although\ndetailed threat modeling and in-depth assessment are required to make further\nclaims. This work reflects our current understanding of AI frontier risks and\nurges collective action to mitigate these challenges.",

Recent research has\nbenchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric\nvision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains.

Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric\nvision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This\nraises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems\nfrom the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the\ndomain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new\nbenchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy\nenables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person\nperspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity\nunderstanding.
