        "summary": "Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,\nyet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing\nmethods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is\nresource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen\neffects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video\ngeneration. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,\nenabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto\ntarget content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to\nunseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning\nstrategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context\nattention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential\neffect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect\nimitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient\none-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on\ntough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories\nof effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain\neffects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a\ncomprehensive dataset to the community.",

        "summary": "Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,\nand animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on\noptimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision\nor on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric\napproximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D\ngeneration of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with\nthe advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending\nthese methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models\nposes significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a\ntraining-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of\ntraining a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a\npre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape\nprior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by\ntreating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images\ncaptured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the\nobject's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring\ntask-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our\nmethod generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts\nunderlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object\ncategories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D\ncompletes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art\napproaches in both quality and versatility.",

Speculative decoding,\nwhich employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger\nAR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without\ncompromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains\nlargely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling\nspace, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model\noutputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial\nstructure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local\ndependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach\nthat harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model\ntoward more accurate and efficient predictions.

        "summary": "Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread\nattention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,\nwhile the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of\nregions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational\nredundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead\napplying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates\nus to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that\naccelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE\nframework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We\nobserved that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for\nmulti-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in\nthe early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited\nregions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the\nreference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,\nwe replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.\nFor edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative\ndenoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,\nwe propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost\nwhile incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.\nObserving that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity\nsimilarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate\nthe local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base\nmodels, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE\nachieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06.

In this\nstudy, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)\nscans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical\nsettings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a\nradiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training\nlabels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.\nAdditionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically\nCT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with\ntraditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning\nfeatures with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical\nCCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two\ngroups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact\nof training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast\ndatasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans.

        "summary": "Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal\nsequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined\ncategories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences\nwhile maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action\nRecognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D\nAction Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims\nto proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,\nhas been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample\nselection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to\nembed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,\ncombined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,\nis utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for\nannotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not\nnecessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may\nhave already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.\nTo solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active\nlearning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process\n(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an\ninformative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of\nskeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of\nthe factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from\nEuclidean space to hyperbolic space.

However, prior work often overlooks the tight\ncoupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex\ninter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device\nmulti-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.\nInstead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire\ninference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,\nallowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also\nintroduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that\ncaptures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain\naccuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for\nfine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during\ninference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and\ninput data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration\noptimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for\neach modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping\nmechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early\npredictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public\nmultimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle\n(UAV)-based multimodal testbed.

        "summary": "Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:\nconventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire\ndepth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an\nill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with\nelements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication\ncomplexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,\nwe first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around\nwhich we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic\nco-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying\nPoint Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform\nelements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a\nsynthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This\nsimulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction\nnetwork that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity\nAll-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.\nExtensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed\nframework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an\nRMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and\nother deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM\nof 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior\nbalance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that\nthe integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint\nreconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the\nintrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging.

        "summary": "Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for\ninterpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods\nusually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects\nand gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both\nthe training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an\nauxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization\nacross the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this\nend, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and\ngaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors\nduring inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded\nspecific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,\nwhich extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using\nthe shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared\nbackbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain\nhead-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head\ndetection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing\nthe gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense\nfeature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the\nsuboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,\nwe propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the\ngaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity\nover Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to\nvariations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze\nobject detection and gaze following tasks.",

Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from\nunreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain\ndiscrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due\nto enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address\nthis limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named\nDiffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages\nunlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively\nrefine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target\nsamples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of\npseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For\nsamples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to\nsemantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while\nsimultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent\ndiffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that\nprogressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain\nand the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark\ndatasets with different scales.

        "summary": "Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes\nby supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.\nYet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid\nrule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability\nacross regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF\nclassification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial\nimagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid\nCNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,\nLSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of\nwoody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous\nstudies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good\nclassification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer\nperforming best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),\nunderscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and\nclassification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and\nreveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge\ndensity, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments\nhighlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable\nlarge-scale mapping.

Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain\nscenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to\ntheir reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce\nDeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local\nsensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen\nforgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:\nLocal Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG\napplies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture\nfine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces\ndomain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding\nfeature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and\nenhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and\nglobal analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior\nrobustness against unseen deepfake attacks.",

        "summary": "Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid\nadvancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial\nanimation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in\nspeech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally\nexpressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the\nscarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of\ndata capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech\nand emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset\nwith neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences\n(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and\nemotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement\nbetween the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture\ninherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The\nlearned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose\nparameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.\nQualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally\ngenerates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate\nlip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves\nsuperior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without\ncompromising lip-sync quality.",

        "summary": "Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings\nbetween two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).\nUnlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical\nintegration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,\nrectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and\nstraight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation\nof high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.\n1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve\nthe target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since\nthe model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its\nperformance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become\nbiased towards the generated data.\n  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original\nrectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into\nthe training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method\neffectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we\ndemonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much\nsmaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved\nsignificantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in\nfull-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the\noriginal method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids\nsaturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE\nlearning while preserving the distribution of real images.",

        "title": "$D^2GS$: Dense Depth Regularization for LiDAR-free Urban Scene Reconstruction",
        "summary": "Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene\nreconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene\nreconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,\n\\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR\npoint clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring\nsuch accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise\nspatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they\nmay not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial\nmisalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To\navoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a\nLiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain\ngeometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more\naccurate. $\\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by\nback-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then\noptimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.\n$\\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense\nmetric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors\nfrom a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.\nIn turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during\nGaussian training. $\\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground\ngeometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within\nroad regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our\nmethod consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more\naccurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.",

Traditional reconstruction\nmethods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require\nmanual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To\naddress this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for\nreal-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from\nisolated interferograms.

Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing\nmethods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass.

This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that\nunifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models\n(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual\nand textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of\nscenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen\ncategories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds\nvisual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal\nfusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on\nVisual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate\nsignificant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,\nactivity detection, and scene captioning.

        "title": "Proper Body Landmark Subset Enables More Accurate and 5X Faster Recognition of Isolated Signs in LIBRAS",
        "summary": "This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark\ndetection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language\n(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled\nsubstantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for\nlandmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,\nwe observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,\nwhile improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome\nthis limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at\noptimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper\nlandmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art\nmethods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.\n(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based\nimputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to\nsubstantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark\nselection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and\naccurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language\nRecognition systems.",

        "title": "FruitProm: Probabilistic Maturity Estimation and Detection of Fruits and Vegetables",
        "summary": "Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for\nagricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic\nharvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a\ndiscrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid\nformulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the\nbiological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class\nboundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity\nestimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel\narchitectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,\nRT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the\nmodel to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each\ndetected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its\nassociated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream\ndecision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like\nselective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more\nbiologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains\nexceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of\n85.6\\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through\nextensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and\naccurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,\npaving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in\nmodern agriculture",

        "title": "Seeing Through the MiRAGE: Evaluating Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation",
        "summary": "We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a\nprevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to\nintegrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing\nevaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to\nmultimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information\nagainst sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG\nevaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information\ncoverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that\nMiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality\njudgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three\nprominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the\nlimitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic\nevaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess\nmultimodal RAG.",
