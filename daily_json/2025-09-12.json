        "title": "A Fully Automatic Framework for Intracranial Pressure Grading: Integrating Keyframe Identification, ONSD Measurement and Clinical Data",
        "summary": "Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral\nfunction, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar\npuncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and\nassociated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve\nsheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP\ndirectly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices\nfor ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,\nsubjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,\nlimiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully\nautomatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe\nidentification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus\nultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,\nrule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus\nstatement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading\nstage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction\nof ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable\nultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical\nevaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a\nvalidation accuracy of $0.845 \\pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from\nfive-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,\nsignificantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \\pm\n0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively\nreducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our\nframework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP\nevaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute\nneurological conditions.",

        "title": "Can Understanding and Generation Truly Benefit Together -- or Just Coexist?",
        "summary": "In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder\nlens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and\ngeneration as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using\nreconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the\ncoherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and\ngeneration processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,\na novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the\ndecoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained\nsemantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via\nreinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase\nto gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction\nloss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to\ngenerate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction\nquality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,\nwhere the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to\nleverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and\ngeneration fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first\nbenchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A\nsurprising \"aha moment\" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL\nprogresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while\nthe decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these\nintricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.",

        "summary": "Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for\nguiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic\nlearning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a\nguided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically\nfeasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as\na system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics\nincluding radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These\nestimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that\naligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on\nthe BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices\nof in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our\nframework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity\nmetrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both\nclinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th\npercentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image\ngeneration in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time\npredictions that account for mechanistic priors.",

However, this\ntask remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without\npre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nand practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga\nline art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this\nproblem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a\nTransformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and\nacross images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching\nalgorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level\ncorrespondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic\nannotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct\nbenchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates\nconsistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for\nreal-world manga applications.",

        "summary": "Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and\nanatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion\nintegrates useful information from different complementary medical images with\ndifferent modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and\nobjectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical\ndiagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of\nmodality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and\ncannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their\napplication in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce\nFlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate\nflexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal\nand tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse\ntransforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition\ninputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion\nprocess and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the\nExpectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration\nprocess, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal\ninformation from source images, independently of the number of input images. We\ncompared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them\non Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The\nexperimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in\nmedical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive\nextension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus\nimage fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the\nperspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.",

        "summary": "Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal\nreasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform\nframe sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.\nHowever, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to\ncritical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,\nwe propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal\nawareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a\nsemantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.\nSpecifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp\ntokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further\nreformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and\nintroduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal\ncoverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with\nthe vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally\nregularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.\nabsolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in\nstate-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video\nbenchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some\nbenchmarks.",

        "summary": "Three-dimensional X-ray histology techniques offer a non-invasive alternative\nto conventional 2D histology, enabling volumetric imaging of biological tissues\nwithout the need for physical sectioning or chemical staining. However, the\ninherent greyscale image contrast of X-ray tomography limits its biochemical\nspecificity compared to traditional histological stains. Within digital\npathology, deep learning-based virtual staining has demonstrated utility in\nsimulating stained appearances from label-free optical images. In this study,\nwe extend virtual staining to the X-ray domain by applying cross-modality image\ntranslation to generate artificially stained slices from\nsynchrotron-radiation-based micro-CT scans. Using over 50 co-registered image\npairs of micro-CT and toluidine blue-stained histology from bone-implant\nsamples, we trained a modified CycleGAN network tailored for limited paired\ndata. Whole slide histology images were downsampled to match the voxel size of\nthe CT data, with on-the-fly data augmentation for patch-based training. The\nmodel incorporates pixelwise supervision and greyscale consistency terms,\nproducing histologically realistic colour outputs while preserving\nhigh-resolution structural detail. Our method outperformed Pix2Pix and standard\nCycleGAN baselines across SSIM, PSNR, and LPIPS metrics. Once trained, the\nmodel can be applied to full CT volumes to generate virtually stained 3D\ndatasets, enhancing interpretability without additional sample preparation.\nWhile features such as new bone formation were able to be reproduced, some\nvariability in the depiction of implant degradation layers highlights the need\nfor further training data and refinement. This work introduces virtual staining\nto 3D X-ray imaging and offers a scalable route for chemically informative,\nlabel-free tissue characterisation in biomedical research.",

        "summary": "3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between\ncohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI\nacquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,\nparticularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as\ncomputer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce\nanatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to\npreserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the\ntraining of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the\nimages (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically\nrelevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we\npropose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as\nprior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph\nModel (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic\ngraph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of\nregions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of\nControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings\nare then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.\nExtensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates\nstructural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.\nFurthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from\ncounterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease\non cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.\nThis achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in\nstudies investigating subtle morphological differences.",

        "summary": "Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the\nexistence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often\nreferred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal\ndenoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to\ncapture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to\ncharacterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,\nproposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that\nresemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method\nhypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of\nconvolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence\nincorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we\npresent evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a\nstatistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of\nconvolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal\nparametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep\nneural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that\nthis locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural\nimage datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser\nthat better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior\nexpert-crafted alternative.",

Recent approaches based on language models, diffusion, and flow\nmatching have shown promising results in zero-shot TTS, but still suffer from\nslow inference and repetition artifacts. Discrete codec representations have\nbeen widely adopted for speech synthesis, and recent works have begun to\nexplore diffusion models in purely discrete settings, suggesting the potential\nof discrete generative modeling for speech synthesis. However, existing\nflow-matching methods typically embed these discrete tokens into a continuous\nspace and apply continuous flow matching, which may not fully leverage the\nadvantages of discrete representations. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce DiFlow-TTS, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model\nto explore purely Discrete Flow Matching for speech synthesis. DiFlow-TTS\nexplicitly models factorized speech attributes within a compact and unified\narchitecture. It leverages in-context learning by conditioning on textual\ncontent, along with prosodic and acoustic attributes extracted from a reference\nspeech, enabling effective attribute cloning in a zero-shot setting. In\naddition, the model employs a factorized flow prediction mechanism with\ndistinct heads for prosody and acoustic details, allowing it to learn\naspect-specific distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that DiFlow-TTS\nachieves promising performance in several key metrics, including naturalness,\nprosody, preservation of speaker style, and energy control. It also maintains a\ncompact model size and achieves low-latency inference, generating speech up to\n25.8 times faster than the latest existing baselines.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly\nenhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction\nconditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,\nwithout modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This\nlimitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.\nTo bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that\nunifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait\ngeneration. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we\ndesign a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a\nblueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing\nhigh-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second\nstage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in\nparallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework\npreserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent\nbehind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and\nstable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world\napplications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To\ncomprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated\nsamples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,\nfluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior\nperformance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic\nexpressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and\ncross-domain generalization.

        "summary": "To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,\nand the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and\nmulti-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection\nframework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese\nencoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly\nintegrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training\nonly a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of\nVFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2\n(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is\ncomplemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains\non the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance\nacross multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD\n(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and\nLEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong\nsuppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance\nof accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable\nparadigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change\ndetection applications.

        "summary": "Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over\nconventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and\ncomplexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep\nlearning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is\na promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help\npredict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and\nanatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help\npredict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either\nignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the\nability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose\nDualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and\nglobal encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.\nThe local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture\nfine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone\n(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed\nhigh-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight\nfusion module then combines these features to estimate the trajectory.\nExperimental results on a large public benchmark show that DualTrack achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy and globally consistent 3D reconstructions,\noutperforming previous methods and yielding an average reconstruction error\nbelow 5 mm.",

        "summary": "The diffusion MRI Neurite Exchange Imaging model offers a promising framework\nfor probing gray matter microstructure by estimating parameters such as\ncompartment sizes, diffusivities, and inter-compartmental water exchange time.\nHowever, existing protocols require long scan times. This study proposes a\nreduced acquisition scheme for the Connectome 2.0 scanner that preserves model\naccuracy while substantially shortening scan duration. We developed a\ndata-driven framework using explainable artificial intelligence with a guided\nrecursive feature elimination strategy to identify an optimal 8-feature subset\nfrom a 15-feature protocol. The performance of this optimized protocol was\nvalidated in vivo and benchmarked against the full acquisition and alternative\nreduction strategies. Parameter accuracy, preservation of anatomical contrast,\nand test-retest reproducibility were assessed. The reduced protocol yielded\nparameter estimates and cortical maps comparable to the full protocol, with low\nestimation errors in synthetic data and minimal impact on test-retest\nvariability. Compared to theory-driven and heuristic reduction schemes, the\noptimized protocol demonstrated superior robustness, reducing the deviation in\nwater exchange time estimates by over two-fold. In conclusion, this hybrid\noptimization framework enables viable imaging of neurite exchange in 14 minutes\nwithout loss of parameter fidelity. This approach supports the broader\napplication of exchange-sensitive diffusion magnetic resonance imaging in\nneuroscience and clinical research, and offers a generalizable method for\ndesigning efficient acquisition protocols in biophysical parameter mapping.",

        "summary": "Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to\nthe root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating\nthem separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global\nmovement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,\ndriven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to\nprecisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,\nwhile deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is\ncomputationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose\nusing whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local\nmotion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of\njoint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a\nphysically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces\nconsistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in\nground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,\nimproves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion.

        "summary": "As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image\nfusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an\ninformative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to\njointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world\napplications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,\nthe target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,\nwith low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal\nresults in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a\nsemantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution\nmethod. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional\ngeneration problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity\nsensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal\nfeature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as\npure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract\nthe global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source\nimages and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising\nprocess via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at\nmultiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with\ncross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a\npowerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.\nExtensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and\nour AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics\nin the fused images.

Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has\nbeen studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of\ncomplex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich\ntextures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce\nhigh-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe\nthat previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and\nover-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and\ntexture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided\nregularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an\noptimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.\nWe demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce\nsuperior results to existing approaches.",

        "summary": "Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of\nlesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,\nMRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most\nsegmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities\nand cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to\nunseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.\nThis work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that\ncontain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,\nand heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any\navailable imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,\nthus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a\nmodality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input\nchannels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image\naugmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations\ndifferentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to\ncreate artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical\nintegrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of\npathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and\nwhite matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,\nDWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the\nability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,\nwhile being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.\nProject code: https://github.com/Anthony-P-Addison/AGN-MOD-SEG",

        "summary": "Purpose: To introduce novel dynamic structural parameters and evaluate their\nintegration within a multimodal deep learning (DL) framework for predicting\npostoperative visual recovery in idiopathic full-thickness macular hole (iFTMH)\npatients. Methods: We utilized a publicly available longitudinal OCT dataset at\nfive stages (preoperative, 2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months). A stage\nspecific segmentation model delineated related structures, and an automated\npipeline extracted quantitative, composite, qualitative, and dynamic features.\nBinary logistic regression models, constructed with and without dynamic\nparameters, assessed their incremental predictive value for best-corrected\nvisual acuity (BCVA). A multimodal DL model combining clinical variables,\nOCT-derived features, and raw OCT images was developed and benchmarked against\nregression models. Results: The segmentation model achieved high accuracy\nacross all timepoints (mean Dice > 0.89). Univariate and multivariate analyses\nidentified base diameter, ellipsoid zone integrity, and macular hole area as\nsignificant BCVA predictors (P < 0.05). Incorporating dynamic recovery rates\nconsistently improved logistic regression AUC, especially at the 3-month\nfollow-up. The multimodal DL model outperformed logistic regression, yielding\nhigher AUCs and overall accuracy at each stage. The difference is as high as\n0.12, demonstrating the complementary value of raw image volume and dynamic\nparameters. Conclusions: Integrating dynamic parameters into the multimodal DL\nmodel significantly enhances the accuracy of predictions. This fully automated\nprocess therefore represents a promising clinical decision support tool for\npersonalized postoperative management in macular hole surgery.",

This paper introduces the Real-World\nRobustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models\nacross three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses\nhigh-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and\nAccidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and\nReligion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset\ngaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining\ndetector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing\nacross various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing\nmodel effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization\nmethods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on\nRRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to\ninvestigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated\nimages. The benchmarking results reveal the limitations of current AI detection\nmethods under real-world conditions and underscore the importance of drawing on\nhuman adaptability to develop more robust detection algorithms.",

To overcome\ndata scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,\nlow-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.\nALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.\nFirst, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over\n200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized\nimage-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization\nwith minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism\nthat varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without\nadded model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints\nto embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while\npreserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical\nattention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances\nlesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps\nare derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and\nhypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically\nconsistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,\nensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET\nacquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality\nsinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to\nmodels trained on larger datasets.

The proposed method adaptively enhances salient\nstructures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while\nsuppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,\nspecially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the\nDifferential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and\ninter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby\nimproving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback\ndifferential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential\nfeatures as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive\nfusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across\nmodalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated\ninto a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative\nRelation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.\nIRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying\nsalient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing\nfeature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive\nexperiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods\nacross diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and\neffectiveness.

        "summary": "Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a\nlabeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship\nbetween their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while\nrejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)\nuse a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization\n(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the\nlearning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),\nwhich integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the\nclosed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most\nrelevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction\nbetween known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four\nchallenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The\nresults demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA\nand ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet\noutperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation\ntasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of\n31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused\nadaptation strategy.",

        "summary": "Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer\nvision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,\ntheir emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature\nextraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive\nbiases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we\npropose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the\nhierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature\nlearning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement\nmodule into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture\nfine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin\non multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,\nMNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent\nperformance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based\nmodels. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on\nCIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the\nbaseline Swin Transformer.

        "summary": "Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical\nfor the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional\ndisplay measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a\nmodel are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they\nfail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer\nsufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and\nphotometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined\nwith a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to\nbe visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a\ncombination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference\npredictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and\nvisual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image\nstacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,\nhomography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function\nas precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual\nDifference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli\nunder different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the\nproposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel\ndetection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our\nuncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper\nbound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals\nfor VDP quality scores.",

While surgical resection is the only potentially\ncurative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes\nvary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic\nfactors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or\nmolecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal\nCRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome\nprediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our\nframework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The\nsegmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from\npartially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete\nmissing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt\npropagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D\nregions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our\nsegmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and\npost-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which\nextracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a\nnovel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.\nSurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from\nright-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors.

Given two text-to-image models, our\ngoal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one\nmodel but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these\nattribute differences. For example, \"flames\" might appear in one model's\noutputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model\ndoes not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon\n(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual\nattributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers\nthe prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's\nability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data\ngeneration pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent\ndifferences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered\nbaselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,\nfinding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning\nloneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American\npeople in media professions.

        "title": "Graph Alignment via Dual-Pass Spectral Encoding and Latent Space Communication",
        "summary": "Graph alignment-the problem of identifying corresponding nodes across\nmultiple graphs-is fundamental to numerous applications. Most existing\nunsupervised methods embed node features into latent representations to enable\ncross-graph comparison without ground-truth correspondences. However, these\nmethods suffer from two critical limitations: the degradation of node\ndistinctiveness due to oversmoothing in GNN-based embeddings, and the\nmisalignment of latent spaces across graphs caused by structural noise, feature\nheterogeneity, and training instability, ultimately leading to unreliable node\ncorrespondences. We propose a novel graph alignment framework that\nsimultaneously enhances node distinctiveness and enforces geometric consistency\nacross latent spaces. Our approach introduces a dual-pass encoder that combines\nlow-pass and high-pass spectral filters to generate embeddings that are both\nstructure-aware and highly discriminative. To address latent space\nmisalignment, we incorporate a geometry-aware functional map module that learns\nbijective and isometric transformations between graph embeddings, ensuring\nconsistent geometric relationships across different representations. Extensive\nexperiments on graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently\noutperforms existing unsupervised alignment baselines, exhibiting superior\nrobustness to structural inconsistencies and challenging alignment scenarios.\nAdditionally, comprehensive evaluation on vision-language benchmarks using\ndiverse pretrained models shows that our framework effectively generalizes\nbeyond graph domains, enabling unsupervised alignment of vision and language\nrepresentations.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated\nstrong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their\neffectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.\nIn particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral\nradiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures\nand subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical\nbenchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first\nlarge-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic\nX-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with\n1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,\nincluding attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,\nand image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a\ncomprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in\ndentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the\nbest-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing\nsignificant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the\nprogress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated\nMMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields\nsubstantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a\n24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a\ncritical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically\nimpactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field.

        "summary": "Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to\nprevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the\ndiagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations\nlabor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings\nmay be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These\nlimitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods\nfor gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named\nCoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The\nmodel is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers\nwith enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block\nAttention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction\nthrough channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled\nto achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification\nperformance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,\nHMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary\nclassification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved\n96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%\nAUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%\nprecision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all\nCNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.\nConclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for\nhistopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing\nperformance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist\npathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in agentic AI have led to systems capable of autonomous task\nexecution and language-based reasoning, yet their spatial reasoning abilities\nremain limited and underexplored, largely constrained to symbolic and\nsequential processing. In contrast, human spatial intelligence, rooted in\nintegrated multisensory perception, spatial memory, and cognitive maps, enables\nflexible, context-aware decision-making in unstructured environments.\nTherefore, bridging this gap is critical for advancing Agentic Spatial\nIntelligence toward better interaction with the physical 3D world. To this end,\nwe first start from scrutinizing the spatial neural models as studied in\ncomputational neuroscience, and accordingly introduce a novel computational\nframework grounded in neuroscience principles. This framework maps core\nbiological functions to six essential computation modules: bio-inspired\nmultimodal sensing, multi-sensory integration, egocentric-allocentric\nconversion, an artificial cognitive map, spatial memory, and spatial reasoning.\nTogether, these modules form a perspective landscape for agentic spatial\nreasoning capability across both virtual and physical environments. On top, we\nconduct a framework-guided analysis of recent methods, evaluating their\nrelevance to each module and identifying critical gaps that hinder the\ndevelopment of more neuroscience-grounded spatial reasoning modules. We further\nexamine emerging benchmarks and datasets and explore potential application\ndomains ranging from virtual to embodied systems, such as robotics. Finally, we\noutline potential research directions, emphasizing the promising roadmap that\ncan generalize spatial reasoning across dynamic or unstructured environments.\nWe hope this work will benefit the research community with a\nneuroscience-grounded perspective and a structured pathway.

This work advances\nCLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in\ndata curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data\nconstruction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of\nMLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields\nWebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text\npairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking\nSynergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively\nmasking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.\nAdditionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the\nmodel to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic\nrepresentation learning.

Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human\nand robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods\nadopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual\ncorrection, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors\nacross stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that\njointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies\ndirectly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground\ntruth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive\nspatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy\nin-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task.

        "title": "ObjectReact: Learning Object-Relative Control for Visual Navigation",
        "summary": "Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has\nrecently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional\nsensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an \"image-relative\"\napproach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and\nsubgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have\nlimitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and\nembodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an\nembodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we\npresent a new paradigm of learning \"object-relative\" control that exhibits\nseveral desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without\nstrictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction\nproblem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high\ninvariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across\nboth training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric\nmap representation in the form of a \"relative\" 3D scene graph, which is used to\nobtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a\nlocal controller, dubbed \"ObjectReact\", conditioned directly on a high-level\n\"WayObject Costmap\" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB\ninput. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over\nits image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple\nnavigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding\ncapability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We\nfurther show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world\nindoor environments.

        "summary": "Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision\nsupport, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major\nconcern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic\ncorrelations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,\nlimiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in\nreal-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling\nframework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from\ntask-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable\nprompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we\ncurate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating\ncaptions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution\nperformance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based\nmethods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets.

In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often\nheterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for\nheterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning\nadapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods\nare impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must\nundergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or\nthe ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.\nTherefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during\ninference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we\nintroduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel\nframework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain\nadaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by\nself-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled\ndata and joint training.

In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that\nresemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.\nSuch behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,\nregardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel\nobject-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles\ntarget representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask\nannotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X\nand low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order\nto obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target\ncharacterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that\nintegrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise\nrepresentation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery\nby preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.",

        "summary": "Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and\nautonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal\nguidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and\nleveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction\ntask into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion\nbased on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:\ncoarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while\nfine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all\nfuture timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity\nremains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory\nmodeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations\ncapture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively\nintegrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In\nthis paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for\nhuman Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals\nfrom coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based\nrecursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive\nrefinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a\nweight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary\ntask to further enhance performance.

Additional\nresults highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging\naggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism\nto trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish\na scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic\ncommunication in future edge intelligence systems.",

        "summary": "Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to\nunderstand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.\nExisting approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information\nfrom knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which\nintroduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a\ntraining-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the\nimpact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.\nFirst, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from\nthe image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval\nof highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the\nretrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract\nanswer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a\nselective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate\nknowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby\nmitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the\nacquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

        "summary": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep\nlearning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases\nsuch as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can\nsuffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related\nto the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related\nto protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against\nunderrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In\nthis work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias\nin DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can\nidentify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or\notherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate\nwhether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model\nperformance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a\nquantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different\nbrain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.\nThrough these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet\nand SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based\nshortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the\nfoundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at\nhttps://github.com/acharaakshit/ShortMR",

        "title": "In-Loop Filtering Using Learned Look-Up Tables for Video Coding",
        "summary": "In-loop filtering (ILF) is a key technology in video coding standards to\nreduce artifacts and enhance visual quality. Recently, neural network-based ILF\nschemes have achieved remarkable coding gains, emerging as a powerful candidate\nfor next-generation video coding standards. However, the use of deep neural\nnetworks (DNN) brings significant computational and time complexity or high\ndemands for dedicated hardware, making it challenging for general use. To\naddress this limitation, we study a practical ILF solution by adopting look-up\ntables (LUTs). After training a DNN with a restricted reference range for ILF,\nall possible inputs are traversed, and the output values of the DNN are cached\ninto LUTs. During the coding process, the filtering process is performed by\nsimply retrieving the filtered pixel through locating the input pixels and\ninterpolating between the cached values, instead of relying on heavy inference\ncomputations. In this paper, we propose a universal LUT-based ILF framework,\ntermed LUT-ILF++. First, we introduce the cooperation of multiple kinds of\nfiltering LUTs and propose a series of customized indexing mechanisms to enable\nbetter filtering reference perception with limited storage consumption. Second,\nwe propose the cross-component indexing mechanism to enable the filtering of\ndifferent color components jointly. Third, in order to make our solution\npractical for coding uses, we propose the LUT compaction scheme to enable the\nLUT pruning, achieving a lower storage cost of the entire solution. The\nproposed framework is implemented in the VVC reference software. Experimental\nresults show that the proposed framework achieves on average 0.82%/2.97%/1.63%\nand 0.85%/4.11%/2.06% bitrate reduction for common test sequences, under the AI\nand RA configurations, respectively. Compared to DNN-based solutions, our\nproposed solution has much lower time complexity and storage cost.",

However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated\nimaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for\ndeploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study\nintroduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework\ntailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet\narchitecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer\nlearning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was\nevaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma\nsegmentation in SSA MRI data.

        "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new\nopportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,\nreasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.\nNevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical\nlimitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D\ninputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient\nspatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor\nadaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment\nConstraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and\ncapacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid\nbut practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an\nembodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task\nplanning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding\nmechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective\nregulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling\ncontext-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware\nReasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment\nconstraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are\nboth goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning\nperformance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of\ndownstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,\nincluding both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile\nplanning capabilities.

        "summary": "Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of\nVision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some\nrely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined\ntoolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single\nreasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate\nsteps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the\nuse of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address\nthis, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual\ninformation of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is\nthat this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation\nconsistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is\nunsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a\nlearnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved\nwith code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive\nframework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct\nvisual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with\nreinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a\ndata-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical\nhallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each\nstrategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments\ndemonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding\nbenchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also\nhow to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each\ntask.",

        "summary": "In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical\nimage analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks\nwithout retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain\nlimited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve\nhigh-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no\nunified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation\nand enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL\nin medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \\textbf{Medverse}, a\nuniversal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering\ndiverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement\nacross multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse\nemploys a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that\nprogressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,\nfull-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical\nawareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that\nfacilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while\npreserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is\nextensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering\npreviously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.\nResults demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL\nbaselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning.

        "summary": "In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally\nintegrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can\nassist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape\nrepresentation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure\ncan be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as\nSDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-\nor mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact\nstorage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF\ncan be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode\nultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,\noverlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.\nMoreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's\nview-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair\nreconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and\nannotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and\nintroduce \\gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric\nconsistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these\nfeatures can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.\nMoreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency\nin the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview\nultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \\gls{UltrON} generalizes to\nshapes of the same anatomy. We show that \\gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations\nof occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D\nreconstruction.

        "summary": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications\nposes unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading\ninformation to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single\nparents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on\npost-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively\nprevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces\nPromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough\ncontribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful\ninformation generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.\nVulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,\nethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create\npopulation-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical\nmulti-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical\nharm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard\norchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,\nEthical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,\nand User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for\nreal-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization\nincluding convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,\nand theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,\nestablishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.",

        "title": "Semantic Concentration for Self-Supervised Dense Representations Learning",
        "summary": "Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made\nsignificant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains\nchallenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that\npatches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance\non dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion\nby involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict\nspatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,\ni.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure\ninter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for\ndense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.\nThese observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for\ndense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill\nthe patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we\npropose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average\nPrecision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and\nadaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.\nSecond, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose\nthe object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.\nSpecifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via\ncross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks\nsoundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in\nhttps://github.com/KID-7391/CoTAP.",

        "summary": "Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical\ncomputer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the\nscarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require\nexpert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative\nenabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success\ncritically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several\nsurgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.\nIn this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how\nself-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA\nperformance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with\nObjective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate\nvarious pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain\nsimilarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific\ndata into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small\nbut domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,\nachieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot\nsettings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into\npre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts\ndownstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%\nin F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but\nlarge-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation.

        "summary": "Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in\nfields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting\nforward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,\nalthough hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve\nrecognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to\ntheir numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.\nTo address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite\nas a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as\nthe research area to perform ground object classification research. A\nclassification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D\nspectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates\nmultimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and\nbreaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods\nby introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the\nwavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\\%, 82.73\\%,\nand 84.94\\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and\nmean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest\nIntersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,\nvegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when\nthe training set proportion was 70\\%, the increase in training time was\nlimited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,\nindicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample\ntraining conditions.",

The\nOCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to\nvalidate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)\ninteractions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to\naccelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes\noverlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,\ncomprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)\nWhole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,\nvalidation, and test subsets.

We address this\nchallenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting\na Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise\nrelationships.
