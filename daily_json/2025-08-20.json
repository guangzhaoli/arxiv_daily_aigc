        "summary": "Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification\nof individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it\nremains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty\nof collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving\nprivacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based\nframework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.\nUnlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative\ngenerative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,\nexclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of\ntemporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the\ngeneration process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates\nsuch as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating\nsynthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline\nleads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.\nAdditionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic\nindividuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity\nembeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and\nare useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.\nOverall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models\nfor high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.",

        "summary": "With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated\nVideo Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content\ncreation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism\nand personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated\nVlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and\nhigh personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated\nmultimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized\nVlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a\ngiven theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent\ncollaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This\nframework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content\ncreation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity\nof the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism\nthat leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,\nthereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also\npropose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that\nprovides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation.

Through critical analysis, we identify why naive\nimage-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to\nachieve adaptive conditioning.

This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless\ninter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling\nstrategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame\npositioning.

        "summary": "The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it\ndetermines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact\nrepresentations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN\nprimarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting\ngeometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored\nhow to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a\nnew framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer\nparadigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D\nGaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our\napproach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such\nas VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their\npatch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes\nimage latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and\nspatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as\nposition, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the\ndensity of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in\nreconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token\nefficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves\nstrong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by\nincreasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a\nsignificant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art\nreconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially\noutperforming existing methods.

        "summary": "Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a\ntarget video based on a query video and a textual description detailing\nspecific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to\nhandle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in\ntemporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained\nsetting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both\nfine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more\ndetailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed\ndataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense\nmodification text that is around seven times more than its existing\ncounterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual\ninformation through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,\nenabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.\nThe proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing\nmethods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\\% Recall@1 in visual+text\nsetting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\\%, highlighting its\nefficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense\nmodification texts.

However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving\nhigh-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,\nresulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To\naddress this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework\nfor 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,\nnoise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions.

Existing DPCLs,\nhowever, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit\nco-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of\ndiscriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),\na DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.\nInspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract\nthe critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into\ndata-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by\nstrategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,\nformulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with\ntheoretically derived optimal parameters.

Previous studies have employed dense SLAM\ntechniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.\nHowever, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which\nare insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete\nreconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires\nincorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.\nHowever, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive\ntraining iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS\nmodeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By\nanalyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal\nnon-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and\nselected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse\nviewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework\nthat incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in\n3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process.

        "summary": "Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on\nintercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100\nkm/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times\nthe 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning\nand braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend\nautonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,\nwhich need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most\nexisting perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye\nView (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and\ncompute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top\nof a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of\nmulti-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised\npre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled\ncamera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and\nachieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of\n30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,\nreaching distances up to 250 meters.

However, most\nmethods are trained and tested on data from a single source, modality, organ,\nor disease type, overlooking the combined potential of other available\nannotated data. Numerous small annotated medical image datasets from various\nmodalities, organs, and diseases are publicly available. In this work, we aim\nto leverage the synergistic potential of these datasets to improve performance\non unseen data. Approach: To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called\nMMIS-Net (MultiModal Medical Image Segmentation Network), which features\nSimilarity Fusion blocks that utilize supervision and pixel-wise similarity\nknowledge selection for feature map fusion. Additionally, to address\ninconsistent class definitions and label contradictions, we created a one-hot\nlabel space to handle classes absent in one dataset but annotated in another.\nMMIS-Net was trained on 10 datasets encompassing 19 organs across 2 modalities\nto build a single model. Results: The algorithm was evaluated on the RETOUCH\ngrand challenge hidden test set, outperforming large foundation models for\nmedical image segmentation and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We achieved\nthe best mean Dice score of 0.83 and an absolute volume difference of 0.035 for\nthe fluids segmentation task, as well as a perfect Area Under the Curve of 1\nfor the fluid detection task.

        "summary": "While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,\ncurrent methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on\npre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics\nintegration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes\nor unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts\na 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,\nenabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We\nfirst establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction\nand probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically\nplausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics\nprediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align\nits simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation\nSampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the\ncomplex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the\ntraining, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,\nannotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates\nhigh-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents\na significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering\nresults. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/",

However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes\nin videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant\nviewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges\ninclude generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original\nvideo, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into\nrealistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a\nsketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local\nmanipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the\nchallenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate\nedited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining\nframes of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise\ngeometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also\nsupported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and\nmanipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a\ndense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the\ninput video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth\nmaps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them\neffectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited\ncontent with the original video while preserving the features of unedited\nregions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video\ndiffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:\nhttp://http://geometrylearning.com/Sketch3DVE/",

Existing methods have attempted to infer the\nintrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two\nmajor challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive\npriors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other\nmodels intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited\ninterpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we\npropose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable\nexpressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,\nwe introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where\nLLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise\nconstitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially\nreduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a\nvision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual\nsimulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law\nand the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level\nevolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from\nvisual observations.

Non-rigid\nregistration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template\n(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information\nfrom multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of\nknown use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and\nregistration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such\nmulti-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection\nof perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be\nregistered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach\nwhere the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D\npoint in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a\ndirection vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation\nw.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from\ncorrespondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,\nthese form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised\ncameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved\nreconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the\nadditional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a\ndeformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex\nprogramming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of\nthe results from the convex solutions.

        "summary": "Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying\nsecurity flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,\ncurrent methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target\ntext or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics\ninto a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering\nfine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its\nbackground. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a\ncritical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in\nVLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline\nwithin VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we\npropose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to\nattack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the\nwidely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into\nfine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over\nadversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens\nrather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the\nQ-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,\nwithout LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and\ntransferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query\nAlignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more\ncontrolled and precise adversarial manipulations.

        "title": "Hierarchical Vision-Language Retrieval of Educational Metaverse Content in Agriculture",
        "summary": "Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across\ndifferent areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or\nmaterials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more\neffective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the\nMetaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an\ninteractive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant\nMetaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a\nchallenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but\nexisting datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In\nthis work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset\ncontaining 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched\nwith textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical\nvision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using\nnatural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method\nachieves up to about 62\\% R@1 and 78\\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and\nit also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\\% R@1 and 11\\%\nMRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and\ndataset are available at\nhttps://github.com/aliabdari/Agricultural_Metaverse_Retrieval .",

        "summary": "The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid\nprogress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across\ndiverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing\nMLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical\nlevels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,\nand Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000\nhuman-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9\ndimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked\nby existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video\nreasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively\nextracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.\nEach question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with\nkey visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over\n30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric\nvisual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space\nperception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of\nHuman-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual\nevidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided\nretrieval.

This paper presents OmniTry, a unified\nframework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,\ne.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical\napplication. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is\nchallenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the\ncorresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged\npipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,\nportraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free\nlocalization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically\ndraw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,\nthe model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency\nof object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows\nquick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a\ncomprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,\nwith both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that\nOmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and\nID-preservation compared with existing methods.

However, the quality of generated samples is\nhighly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we\nidentify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the\npresence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation\nand renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this\ngap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish\na correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.\nFurthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based\nmethod for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error\ncan be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step\nduring inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization\nframework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step\nand enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed\nmethod outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.\nFurthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image\ngeneration, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring\nits versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.",

However,\nexisting methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and\ngeometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between\nconflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual\ndecoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we\nintroduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for\nthe semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric\nbranch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,\ndecoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.\nOur dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are\nthen utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D\nfeatures. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module\nthat addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by\nanisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous\nimprovements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by\n+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI.

        "summary": "While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general\nreasoning in vision-language models, its application to tasks requiring\nin-depth understanding of information-rich images and generation of structured\noutputs remains underexplored. Chart-to-code generation exemplifies this\nchallenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate\nstructured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,\nhighlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward\nstructured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in\nSFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured\nReinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially\nbreaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,\ncontaining 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate\nsimplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art\nperformance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a\nplateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method\nleverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual\nand visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate\nfine-grained code details.

We observe that recent RVOS\napproaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal\nmodeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In\nfact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head\ndesign. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video\nObject Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation\nmethods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,\nour model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On\ntop of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the\nrandomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying\nthe model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature\nextraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement\n(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without\nintroducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS\nbenchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

In this paper, we propose a novel framework,\nnamely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in\nunseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only\nemploying a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind\nDictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for\nunseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the\nnormal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,\nDictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -\nto simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from\nnormal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region\nfeatures from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature\ncannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination\nRegularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features\nharder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query\nConstraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive\nexperiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that\nDictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.",

To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like\nEncoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational\nprinciples and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced\nby the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data\nto carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete\nvisual spike signal.

Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3\nconvolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity\nwithout compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a\ntwo-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training\nidentifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning\npermanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This\ndual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode\noptimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%\ncomputation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video\nCoding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics.

        "summary": "Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing\nmultiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and\nISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving\nhigh-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long\nshutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods\noften overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail\nto account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.\n  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method\nthat optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize\nHDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an\nimage synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation\ninto our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure\nhistograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences\nbased on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure\nschedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

In this work, we investigate\nthe robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor\nperturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of\nsignal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness\nproblem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without\nweight perturbations.

However, formulating each image with a\nseparate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to\ncomputational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address\nthis issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image\nefficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several\ntrained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly\nsimilar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate\nlayers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as\ninput-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each\nimage to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image\nreconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to\n60\\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR\nscales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB.

This necessitates a deep exploration of the\ndecoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate\nindependently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with\ndifferent modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To\naddress this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement\nframework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables\nindividual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional\nexpression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four\nlightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent\nspaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space\nis characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define\nspecific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce\northogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate\nmotion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.\nThe learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared\nvisual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each\nspace, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head\nsynthesis.

Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and\ngeneralization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of\nreal-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nstructured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables\nautomatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual\nrisk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy\nto produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as\nknowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much\nsmaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision\nfor Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding\nlow-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware\ncaptions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves\nstrong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,\nROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This\ndemonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent\nsupervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning\ncapabilities.

However,\nacquiring dMRI data requires to capture multiple 3D brain volumes in a short\ntime, often leading to trade-offs in image quality. One challenging artifact is\nsusceptibility-induced distortion, which introduces significant geometric and\nintensity deformations.

        "summary": "Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in\nwhite-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded\nexamples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have\na few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial\nexamples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained\nattacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this\npaper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that\ngenerates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by\nstrategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a\nmulti-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial\nexamples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and\npropagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this\nprocess by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,\nenabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base\nattack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models\nacross CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on\nLp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nperceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates\n(e.g., 20.63\\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,\nLPIPS, and FID (improvements $\\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).\nFurthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical\nand strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted\nadaptive attacks for each new defense.",

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in\nautonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,\nreasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural\nlanguage instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant\ncomputational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view\nimages, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.\nThis overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during\nencoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the\nquadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose\nPrune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs\nin autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a\ndiversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,\nwhich prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than\nrelying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller\nthat learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their\nimportance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does\nnot require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible\nwith modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two\nlarge-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that\nPrune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining\nor improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,\nour method achieves a 6.40$\\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes\n13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM\nbenchmark.",

This task demands robust visual reasoning\ncapabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships\nwithin images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these\nabilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark\ncomprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively\nsimple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and\nproprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably\nidentify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information\n-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought\nprompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate\nthat most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\\deg}) images,\nwhile certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\\deg}) images. None\ncan reliably distinguish between 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg}. Simultaneously showing\nthe image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains\nfor reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the\nperformance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve\nmodels' ability to distinguish 90{\\deg} and 270{\\deg} rotations, despite\nsubstantially improving the identification of 180{\\deg} images.

LCRReg requires no concept\nlabels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to\nsynthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for\npredefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides\na Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces\nassociated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and\nreal-world medical tasks.

In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose\nestimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables\naccurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth\ndata. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for\ncategory-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to\npredict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that\nthese predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we\nintroduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's\nability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,\nwe utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing\nthe challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not\nonly highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous\nRGB-based methods.

        "summary": "Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the\nrealm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of\nmedical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as\nCNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while\nTransformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address\nthese deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)\ndesigned to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features\nare seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and\nCross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in\neach of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two\ninput features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both\nlong-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging\nconvolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by\nintegrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),\nthe ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting\nincreased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into\nthe encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework\ndubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet).

However, its\nhigh computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains\nhave shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural\nnetworks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing\naccuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural\nframework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a\nsingle-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core\nchallenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable\neffective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs\ninitialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization\nacross diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric\nnormalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.\nLearnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in\npost-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and\nsimple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,\ngeneralizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic\nmanner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction.

        "summary": "Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general\ntrends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes\npre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Continual\nlearning offers a solution by fine-tuning a model sequentially on different\ndomains or tasks, enabling it to integrate new knowledge without requiring\nlarge datasets for each training phase. In this paper, we propose UNIfied\nCONtinual Learning for Medical Foundational Models (UNICON), a framework that\nenables the seamless adaptation of foundation models to diverse domains, tasks,\nand modalities. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat these changes\nin isolation, UNICON provides a unified, perpetually expandable framework.\nThrough careful integration, we show that foundation models can dynamically\nexpand across imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and clinical objectives\nwithout catastrophic forgetting or task interference. Empirically, we validate\nour approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for\nclassification to a prognosis and segmentation task. Our results show improved\nperformance across both additional tasks. Furthermore, we continually\nincorporated PET scans and achieved a 5\\% improvement in Dice score compared to\nrespective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models are not\ninherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve, paving\nthe way toward generalist AI models for medical imaging.",

IL must balance\nadaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations\noften rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL\nperformance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object\nDetection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a\nfixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains\nand classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and\nsynthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera\nsensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture\nchallenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL\nmethods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small\namount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual\ntraining on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to\nweak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse\ntasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.",

        "summary": "The Circle of Willis (CoW), vital for ensuring consistent blood flow to the\nbrain, is closely linked to ischemic stroke. Accurate assessment of the CoW is\nimportant for identifying individuals at risk and guiding appropriate clinical\nmanagement. Among existing imaging methods, Transcranial Color-coded Doppler\n(TCCD) offers unique advantages due to its radiation-free nature,\naffordability, and accessibility. However, reliable TCCD assessments depend\nheavily on operator expertise for identifying anatomical landmarks and\nperforming accurate angle correction, which limits its widespread adoption. To\naddress this challenge, we propose an AI-powered, real-time CoW\nauto-segmentation system capable of efficiently capturing cerebral arteries. No\nprior studies have explored AI-driven cerebrovascular segmentation using TCCD.\nIn this work, we introduce a novel Attention-Augmented Wavelet YOLO (AAW-YOLO)\nnetwork tailored for TCCD data, designed to provide real-time guidance for\nbrain vessel segmentation in the CoW. We prospectively collected TCCD data\ncomprising 738 annotated frames and 3,419 labeled artery instances to establish\na high-quality dataset for model training and evaluation. The proposed AAW-YOLO\ndemonstrated strong performance in segmenting both ipsilateral and\ncontralateral CoW vessels, achieving an average Dice score of 0.901, IoU of\n0.823, precision of 0.882, recall of 0.926, and mAP of 0.953, with a per-frame\ninference speed of 14.199 ms. This system offers a practical solution to reduce\nreliance on operator experience in TCCD-based cerebrovascular screening, with\npotential applications in routine clinical workflows and resource-constrained\nsettings.

        "summary": "The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from\nremote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer\nvision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level\nrecognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization\npostprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs\nbut suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.\nGraph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network\nvertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast\ntopology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To\naddress these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines\ngraph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by\ndecoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex\nprediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural\ninnovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast\ninference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.\nComprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA\ngraph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while\nbeing approximately 10 $\\times$ faster.

        "summary": "Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping\n(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,\nachieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely\ndetected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive\nenvironments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.\nTherefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false\npositive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly\nfocus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge\nof the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,\nwe propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the\nhistorical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in\nchallenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used\nto estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory\nis then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the\ntrajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to\ndetermine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and\nreal-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nFurthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify\nits robustness and efficiency.

Despite its notable success in recent years,\nthis paradigm has inherent limitations and has always been struggling with\npractical requirements: (i) scaling to the rare tumor diseases with very\nlimited samples and (ii) benefiting from the generalizable prognostic knowledge\nin other cancers. To this end, this paper presents the first systematic study\non Prognostic Knowledge Transfer in Pathology, called Path-PKT. It comprises\nthree main parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 13 cancers\nand use it to evaluate the transferability of prognostic knowledge between\ndifferent cancers computationally. (2) We design experiments to understand what\nfactors affect knowledge transfer and what causes positive transfers. (3)\nMotivated by empirical findings, we propose a new baseline approach (MoE-PKT)\nwith a routing mechanism to utilize the generalizable prognostic knowledge in\nother cancers. Finally, we show the transferability of source models to rare\ntumor diseases. This study could lay solid foundations for the study of\nknowledge transfer in WSI-based cancer prognosis.

State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly\nrely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision\nTransformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a\nnovel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for\nFR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility\nscore for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated\nwith the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via\nglobal self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information\nacross all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two\nheads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn\ndiscriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)\nthe quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face\nsample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several\nFR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that\nViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance.

        "summary": "The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance\non biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,\nhighlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the\nsuitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the\nmost widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which\nno longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging\nvulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work\nrevisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey\ninvolving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in\nproperty ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows\nimproved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows\ndecreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further\nanalysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the\nconsistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the\nratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level\nuncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most\nmodalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence\nwith expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key\nopen challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.",

        "summary": "State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural\nnetworks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face\na critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep\nprocessing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.\nThis inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN\nparadigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose\nthe timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly\nreduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights\ninto SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our\nfinding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate\nperturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep\nevaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse\n(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are\ninefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can\nbe pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the\nCIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the\nrequired attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in\nwhite-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable\nattack success rate.",

Despite\ndoubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,\nprevious research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data\navailability and multi-person tracking.

We\nextracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose\nand embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN.

To perform this study, we first assemble the largest\ncurated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,\nencompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a\ndedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,\n96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal\nmeasurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these\npatients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)\noccurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face\nheight ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%).

Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources\nsuch as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns\nhave intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for\nincreased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at\nregional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key\ncomponent in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate\nmatter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P\nair constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory\n(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations\nmore effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index\nat 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be\nforecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of\n~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74.

        "summary": "Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in\nsmart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face\nmask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for\nsmart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode\nverification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the\nsurveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system\nremotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local\nBinary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified\nLBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an\nAccuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall\nof approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the\nsystem is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating\nthe operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the\ndoor, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for\nfuture use in the user acceptance test.",

        "title": "Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering",
        "summary": "In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some\nmultiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,\nRealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias\nallows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only\nthe vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question\n(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in\nvisual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the\nvisual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut\nfor VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To\nfix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates\nhard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it\nto the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these\nEOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)\nsettings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,\nproviding a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new\nannotations will be released soon.",

        "summary": "We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and\nresponds to speech so a user can monitor and steer it from a phone or browser.\nThe system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive\nbase with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live\nfeed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are\ndetected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice\ninteraction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual\ntranslation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read\nback responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual\ninput and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at\ninteractive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates\nthem to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf\nhardware and open software, making it easy to reproduce. We discuss limits and\npractical extensions, including sensor fusion with ultrasonic range data, GPU\nacceleration, and adding face and text recognition.",

        "summary": "Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing\nulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to\ngrade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to\nlabel noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the\nscore, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum\nlearning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal\nstructure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston\nBowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation\nconfidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum\nis further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.\nExperiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and\nTransformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong\nsupervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches\n82.5\\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These\nresults highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for\nimproving ordinal classification under label uncertainty.

The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior\ndensity is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter.\nThe selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed,\nincluding the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected\nfrom the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is,\nin this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting\nPMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and\nthe data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the\nproblematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better\nmodel-based algorithms in future developments.",
