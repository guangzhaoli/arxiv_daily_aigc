        "summary": "Recent studies in speech-driven talking face generation achieve promising\nresults, but their reliance on fixed-driven speech limits further applications\n(e.g., face-voice mismatch). Thus, we extend the task to a more challenging\nsetting: given a face image and text to speak, generating both talking face\nanimation and its corresponding speeches. Accordingly, we propose a novel\nframework, Face2VoiceSync, with several novel contributions: 1) Voice-Face\nAlignment, ensuring generated voices match facial appearance; 2) Diversity \\&\nManipulation, enabling generated voice control over paralinguistic features\nspace; 3) Efficient Training, using a lightweight VAE to bridge visual and\naudio large-pretrained models, with significantly fewer trainable parameters\nthan existing methods; 4) New Evaluation Metric, fairly assessing the diversity\nand identity consistency. Experiments show Face2VoiceSync achieves both visual\nand audio state-of-the-art performances on a single 40GB GPU.",

        "summary": "This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular\nsemantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature\nentanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.\nVisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing\nthe visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions\n(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware\nprojection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while\npreserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a\nhallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the\ninvisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene\ncompletion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates\nfeature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly\nimproved reconstruction quality.\n  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on\ntwo challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360.

Generating multi-human\ncontextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among\nhuman-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large\nlanguage model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input\nand convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate\nmulti-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.\nSpecifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a\ndynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a\nwell-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we\nsynthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial\nguidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive\ncontext, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the\nretrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale\nand with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of\ncontextual reasoning.

First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention\nby suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving\nalignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected\nlayers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and\nsoft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding.

        "summary": "We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair\ncompositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical\napplicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for\nflexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.",

        "summary": "The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed\nmonocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major\nlimitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses\nduring training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To\naddress these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)\na pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)\nand analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of\nprecise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D\nmodel represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose\nrelative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize\n3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images\nneeded -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the\nCNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.\nThis work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their\neffectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose\nestimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,\nthe pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the\ndoor for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.",

        "summary": "The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in\nlarge vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,\nthe internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding\nremain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,\ncircuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual\nsemantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our\nframework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing\ncircuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we\ndiscover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object\ntokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.\nFurthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions\nemerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.\nIn contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we\nreveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional\nlocalization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant\nmechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a\nfoundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.",

        "summary": "The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be\nsurmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as\nhardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to\nscale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic\ncomputational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this\npaper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device\nusing generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and\ninference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic\nsingle device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions\n-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between\naccuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE\n(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient\ntransformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse\nmodalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,\nprogressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational\nblocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of\ntokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence\nbecomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE\nachieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to\nexisting long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple\nmodalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.",

To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT\nadaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate\nmultiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various\nresource constraints.

In the first stage, we\nenhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables\nstructural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,\nembedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and\nensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that\nprogressively increases elasticity.

In this paper,\nwe introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,\ntraining-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable\ninteractions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group\ninteractions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages\npretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose\ngroup interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts\nsuch as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs\nphysics-based penalties during noise optimization.

        "summary": "In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for\nmultimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that\nrely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation\ntechniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to\nvarious missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.\nSpecifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts\n(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that\nautomatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial\nmodality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer\n(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains\nstable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an\nintuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase\naccuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS\n2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it\nconsistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,\ninterpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing\nmodality scenarios at test time.",

        "summary": "Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention\nand achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying\n3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite\nexplicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud\nbackbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to\nadequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the\ndisparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the\nscarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal\nscenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world\nabnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly\ndetection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key\naspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data\nsimply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth\nand appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the\nflexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly\nGenerator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies\nin RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,\neffectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can\ndirectly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.\nExperiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD\nand Eyecandies datasets.

        "summary": "Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human\nprioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms\nwith objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation\nand hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models\nand datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive\ndiversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,\ntypically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to\ngenerate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which\nlimiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.\nFurthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it\nvery costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving\nmultiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is\nchallenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized\nAttention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal\ndataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age\nand gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel\neye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities\nthrough Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and\nguided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs\nproduce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,\nwe introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired\nby the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.\nExtensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach.

        "title": "Joint Holistic and Lesion Controllable Mammogram Synthesis via Gated Conditional Diffusion Model",
        "summary": "Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer\nscreening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support\nlarge-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods\nis often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in\nlesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise\ncontrol over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of\nsynthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool\nfor clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/lixinHUST/Gated-Conditional-Diffusion-Model/",

Despite shared architecture and\nlearning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high\nperceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity\nand faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a \"generative model zoo\" and\nsystematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive\nmodels navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of\ngenerative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing\non image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as\nwell as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models\noffer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to\nhallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain\nstable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally\nlower fidelity.",

Existing\nplane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable\nlow-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.\nAlthough 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank\nconstraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to\nsubstantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we\npresent DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D\nhash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins\nwith a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and\nstatic components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we\nintroduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an\nexplicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we\npresent a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate\nunstable deformation artifacts.

To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a\nhigh-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core\ninnovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated\nwith the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and\nsuppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss)\ncombining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture\nrestoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing\n1,000 high-definition video-text pairs.

For a given uniform-bit quantization\nconfiguration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin\nblocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important\nwindows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We\nintroduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in\nhigh- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with\nmost quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the\nCOCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x\ncomputational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,\nMixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP\ndrop by incorporating activation pruning.

        "summary": "Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric\npriors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly\nrely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and\nprevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for\nauto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy\nreconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic\nscene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing\nvision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from\nincomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from\ndiverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy\nmodels on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.\nIt highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy\nreconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.

        "summary": "Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching\nremains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric\ndifferences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract\nfeatures at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal\nsimilarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)\nmechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant\nkeypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our\napproach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating\ncorrespondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions\nsimultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as\na classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)\nlayers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive\nlocal features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in\nrobust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the\npractical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object\ndetection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method\nachieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016\nand 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains\ncomputational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results\nvalidate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances\ndownstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.",

        "summary": "Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various\ndiseases. However, the inherent class imbalance in the distribution of clinical\nfindings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep\nlearning models. These models often fail to accurately classify long-tailed\nclasses. Current Vision-Language models such as Contrastive Language Image\nPre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the\nlatent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP\nperforms well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals\nthat its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed\ndistribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly\naligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method\nensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with\nparticular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely\nobserved classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)\nclustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by\nStudent t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered\nembeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the\nfeatures. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\\% points in\nzero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from\nprevious SOTA models.",

Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are\nknown to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these\nlimitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors\ncan be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic\nblood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an\nobject detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white\nblood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the\nConvolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to\nenhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the\nAdaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which\noptimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the\nnetwork. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the\nIntersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over\nUnion (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.\nCompared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5\nand 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and\nincreased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time\napplications.",

        "summary": "Purpose: Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for adaptive radiation therapy\n(ART) but remains time-consuming and user-dependent. Segment Anything Model 2\n(SAM2) shows promise for prompt-based segmentation but struggles with tumor\naccuracy. We propose prior knowledge-based augmentation strategies to enhance\nSAM2 for ART.\n  Methods: Two strategies were introduced to improve SAM2: (1) using prior MR\nimages and annotations as contextual inputs, and (2) improving prompt\nrobustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. The\nresulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver\ndataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without\nretraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86\nMRIs, 37 patients).\n  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and\nprompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver),\n0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain). It demonstrated strong generalization across\ntumor types and imaging sequences, with improved performance in\nboundary-sensitive metrics.\n  Conclusions: Incorporating prior images and enhancing prompt diversity\nsignificantly boosts segmentation accuracy and generalizability. SAM2-Aug\noffers a robust, efficient solution for tumor segmentation in ART. Code and\nmodels will be released at https://github.com/apple1986/SAM2-Aug.",

        "summary": "Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,\ndemanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and\ncontextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim\nto construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by\nreasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it\nshould be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do\nnot constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be\nunified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks\nwith distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote\nsensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on\nsupervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To\nthis end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote\nsensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal\nlarge language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing\ntargets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity\noutput generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained\nwith reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for\nprecise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable\ndiverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific\ndecoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that\nRemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity\nreasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our\nframework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond\nthe reach of existing reasoning pipelines.",

        "summary": "Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a\nsubset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic\nanalysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential\nto enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying\nby defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each\naligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on\naccurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object\ncounting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on\nindexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide\naccurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,\nstate-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object\ncounts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this\nlimitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for\naccurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing\non accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding\nobject centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance\nwith a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling\nbetter handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To\nadapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model\nselection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each\ninput. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that\nCounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,\nresulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.",

        "summary": "This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to\nsegment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a\nmodel on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two\nmainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype\nlearning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning\nmethods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance\nthe conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS\nframeworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we\npropose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which\nintroduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention\nScore Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning\nmodel (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions\ngenerated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype\npredictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image\nrepresentations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)\nrelationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of\nthe affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually\nincreasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results\nshow that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and\n5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its\neffectiveness.

While universal lesion\nsegmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time\npoints. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model\nin a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and\nfollow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track\nlesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a\nsharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan\nregistration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence\nprocess. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled\nexperiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the\ntrue lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is\nhighly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy\ncollapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a\nfundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal\ndata. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift\naway from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models\ninherently designed for temporal analysis.",

Different from previous efforts, in this article, we propose a\nnovel piecewise smooth MS mesh segmentation model by utilizing the relaxed\ntotal generalized variation regularization (rTGV). The new model assumes that\nthe feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise\nconstant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to\ncharacterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure. The newly\nintroduced method is effective in segmenting meshes with irregular structures\nand getting the better boundaries rather than the shortest boundaries. We solve\nthe new model by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is discussed from several aspects, and\ncomparisons with several state-of-art methods. Experimental results show that\nour method can yield competitive results when compared to other approaches. In\naddition, our results compare favorably to those of the several state-of-art\ntechniques when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark. Furthermore,\nthe quantitative errors and computational costs confirm the robustness and\nefficiency of the proposed method.",

Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is\nproposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of\npulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the\nin-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the\nsemi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of\nlabeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher\nmodel is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which\nreliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the\nstudent model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is\niteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:\nExtensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD\npatients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by\n2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is\nconducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the\ndifferences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.\nConclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of\npulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis.

However, existing generative model-based OSFL\nmethods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in\nthe healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single\nround of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically\nDistributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a\nmodified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified\nFlow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation\nmethod are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling\nin medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing\nfeature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID\ndistributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic\nthe output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side\nteacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID\nmedical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform\nmulti-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,\nand exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%.

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point\ncloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,\ndue to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,\nthese methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the\nconflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the\nensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above\nchallenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates\npoint cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust\nanalysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a\nRectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted\nrectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving\nintricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we\nfurther incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts\nbased on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and\nadaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently\nunify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point\ncloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete\npoint cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods.

Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a\npromising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high\ncomputational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address\nthese challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel\ntraining-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous\nautoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the\nvalue of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive\nreconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these\ntwo reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further\ncalibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which\ninherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with\nautoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.\nExperiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%\nhigher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while\nrequiring only 1% of the computational time.",

        "summary": "Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in\ngeometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods\ntypically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the\nunderlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural\ninformation from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into\nsemantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.\nWe present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with\ndiffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the\npoint set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution\nthat is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with\nnovel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the\nsource and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input\npoint clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from\nsurface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.\nThe results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and\nsemantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing\ntasks where structured point distributions are desired.

        "summary": "Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong\ncapabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding\nremains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as\nbackground knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel\nmulti-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view\nsticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,\ninspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple\nviews, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by\nproviding rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a\nhierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual\nunderstanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both\nglobal and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive\nlearning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different\nstages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and\nlocal-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce\na text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall\nmultimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on\n2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly\noutperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher\naccuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best\npre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%\non F1 and 4.0% on accuracy.

To address this, we\nintroduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)\nbenchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,\nto fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained\nmodels, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:\nWiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and\nWiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing.

This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that\ndeviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement\nand scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we\npropose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to\ndistribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their\ndominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric\nalignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view\nnormal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both\nlocal and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we\nintroduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and\napply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a\ncleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results\ndemonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,\nenabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel\nGaussian-based 3D environments.

        "summary": "Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision\napplications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and\ngenerative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with\nprecise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming\nobjects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce\nHQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a\nnovel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing\nthese limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)\nleveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based\ncandidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved\nobject boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that\nselectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby\noptimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and\n(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex\ntopological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These\ncontributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,\ncoarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update\nschedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues\nassociated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public\ndatasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method\nconsistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets.

In particular, for certain\nspecialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently\npopulated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of\nlimited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets\ncompared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To\ntackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely\nSyn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the\nmodel performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic\ncamouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be\nutilized.

        "summary": "Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,\nand inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within\nthe floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the\nmodal gap while improving localization success without increasing the\ncomputational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nand substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released\nafter the anonymous review.",

Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point\nclouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric\nstructure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,\nMAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain\neffective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting\nand prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the\noptimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and\nundefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and\nundefendability.

Stage 1 consists of\nV-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training\ncomplexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific\nfacial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,\nthat reconstructs the output phonemes back to words.

        "summary": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with\nthe complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges\nin aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While\nViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally\nintensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To\naddress these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token\nClustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt\ntokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in\nan end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,\nusing projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity\nwhile preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based\npooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive\nexperiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in\nclassification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong\ninterpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.",

Videos and images\ngenerated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more\ndifficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new\nmodels to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted\nto solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional\nneural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly\ninteracts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using\nsolely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of\nboth deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an\napproach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on\nidentifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image\nprocessing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction\ntechnique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial\nlandmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance\nmetrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings\ndiscussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models\nwith accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering\naround 78%.

In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between\nsubsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling\nalgorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables\npredicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state\nobservations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This\npaper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static\nfeatures. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics\nof the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to\nenable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together\nmixtures of \"persistence\" and \"emergence\" filters to model the probability that\nfeatures will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The\napproach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating\nthe states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at\narbitrary future times.

Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the\nentire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to\nestimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road\nregion. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a\nBEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame\ndrivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using\nonly monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several\nchallenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space\ncorridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel\nself-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future\nego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual\ncorridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion\nprocess to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the\nexisting binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.\nTherefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture\nthat denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask\nrepresentations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.\nWe evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and\nCARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal\nnavigable corridors in the image.",
