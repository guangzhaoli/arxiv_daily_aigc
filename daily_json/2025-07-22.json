Building on\nthis insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages\nconditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction.\nSpecifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task,\nwhere a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative\nsignals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular\nconditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic\nspatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient\ntransmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition\ntraining with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent\nover-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive\nexperiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and\nneural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\\'echet Video Distance\n(FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.",

        "summary": "Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make\nvisual tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that\nmodern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --\nreconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or\nmasking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose\naligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,\nencouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily\ncorrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer\n(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images\nfrom latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.\nExtensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer\nconsistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative\ngenerative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design\nprinciple for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new\nperspectives for future tokenizer design.",

        "summary": "Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while\ndiffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,\nextending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and\nlong-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage\nframework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method\ndecomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic\ncontrol, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth\ntransition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion\nmodel guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses\nshort clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To\n(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens\nat once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,\nan adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,\nreducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal\nand content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By\nleveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method\nprovides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new\npossibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive\nsimulations.

The combination of\ncylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical\nlocations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning\nand robustness to different resolutions.

        "summary": "In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent.\nHowever, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical\nresearch focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information\nseparately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately\nrepresent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to\ntemporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature\nextraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and\nvideo understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video\nrepresentation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce\na set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas\ncontaining fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature\nextraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the\nfine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to\nmaintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video\nRotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency\nof DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this\ncombined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video\nunderstanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in\nenhancing video comprehension.",

To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a\ntraining-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.\nEgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR\nfor temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering\n(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and\nremoves redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token\nselector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame\ndiversity.

        "summary": "Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive\nand high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised\nsemantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the\nlabeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through\nself-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation\nmodels pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize\nacross domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational\nsegmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as\nan annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of\nusing SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual\ninput, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the\nshortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose\nConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation\nmodel using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable\npixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as\nsupervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models\nto target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the\nstrong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which\nbenefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training\nstrategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training\nstage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,\nConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and\nhelps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.",

        "summary": "Recent progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation has enabled the synthesis\nof visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language.\nHowever, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing\noutputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior,\nand tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The\nbenchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use,\nmaterial properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical\nplausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse\nstate-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1)\nformulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated\nvideo with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer\nseveral physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect\nstrategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based\nevaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas\noverlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured,\ninterpretable framework for assessing physical commonsense in generative video\nmodels.",

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language\nbackbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new\ntasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and\nanswers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language\ndatasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the\ndemonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on\ntextual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal\nadaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its\npractical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the\nimproved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual\ncontext. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably\nevaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues,\nwe first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient\nfine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by\nrebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present\nTrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that\nexplicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly\nvisual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements\nin the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities.

Although this task\nhas seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing\nstronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific\ncomparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation\nparadigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to\nperformance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches\nbecome lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways\nacross generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop\ntransformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the\nliterature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on\nImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.\nFirst, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and\nperformant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously\nunderexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending\nclassifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a\nstrong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the\nmotivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate\n\"forgetting\" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream\ndata, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control\nconsistency.

However, due to the limitation of encoding time\nand decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry\ncompression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud\ngeometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for\nPoint Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we\ndesign a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network\ninitialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A\nlightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale\ncontext extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is\nproposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental\nresults show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based\nmethods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method\nreduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and\n21.95% compared to SparsePCGC.

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by\ncombining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content\nthat is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to\nstruggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible\nbut factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the\nimage. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly\nsuppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.\nHowever, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer\nstage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and\nthe differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability\ndistributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.\nMotivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a\nsimple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with\nthe most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output\ndistributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and\npure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally\nincorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,\nEVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding\nstrategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on\nwidely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces\nhallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its\neffectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.",

This study\ninvestigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake\ndetection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing\ndeepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while\nmaintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with\nMesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and\nFaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain\nwinning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at\nsubstantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%\naccuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000\nparameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results\nalso show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach\nconsistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods.

        "summary": "3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and\nhighly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The\napplication to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the\ndiscrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry\nconstraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra\ncontinuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian\nprimitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing\nmemory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a\ndiscretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by\nencoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us\nto link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity\ntransformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the\ncomputational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the\ndiscrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete\nrepresentation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\\eg Eikonal\nloss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and\nenforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based\nconsistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher\nrelighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding\ncomplex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method\noutperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is\navailable at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF.",

Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation\ntasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and\ntasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant\nsim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To\naddress this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation\nmanipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web\ndata. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training\nparadigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical\nspace alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic\ntasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which\nachieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand\ntrajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further\ndevelop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous\nsources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a\nlarge-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We\nempirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and\ninstruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.\nImportantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic\nmanipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied.

We\npropose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a\nlearned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a\nStyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,\nwe sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different\nclasses and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition\nthe generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that\nlie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale\nCOVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,\nEfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1\nover traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for\nCOVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,\ndelivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without\ndisrupting existing training pipelines.

Previous procedure learning methods typically learn frame-to-frame\ncorrespondences between videos before determining key steps and their order.\nHowever, their performance often suffers from order variations,\nbackground/redundant frames, and repeated actions. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which\nutilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a\nstructural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,\noptimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to\ndegenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the\nembedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step. To\naddress that limitation, we further integrate a contrastive regularization\nterm, which maps different frames to different points in the embedding space,\navoiding the collapse to trivial solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive\nexperiments on large-scale egocentric (i.e., EgoProceL) and third-person (i.e.,\nProceL and CrossTask) benchmarks to demonstrate superior performance by our\napproach against previous methods, including OPEL which relies on a traditional\nKantorovich optimal transport formulation with an optimality prior.",

Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning\nand code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their\nadvantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal\ndata type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in\ncomplex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain\nvision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex\nchart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic\ndata synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning\ndata covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of\nreasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training\nstrategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and\nChart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims\nto decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable\nsubtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for\nimproving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the\ntypical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft\nreward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity\nin the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks\nand self-built chart reasoning dataset (\\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}).

        "summary": "Despite recent advances, Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) is still hindered by\nmultiple inherent uncertainties, such as ambiguous textual queries, indistinct\ntext-video mappings, and low-quality video frames. Although interactive systems\nhave emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through\nclarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc\nstrategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their\neffectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an\nUncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that\nexplicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping\nuncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:\nsemantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon\ndivergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based\nFrame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions\nguided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries,\nsignificantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1\n(69.2\\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby\nestablishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.",

Furthermore, it can\nbe efficiently fine-tuned with minimal human trajectory data, enabling rapid\nand cost-effective adaptation to new settings. GR-3 also excels in handling\nlong-horizon and dexterous tasks, including those requiring bi-manual\nmanipulation and mobile movement, showcasing robust and reliable performance.\nThese capabilities are achieved through a multi-faceted training recipe that\nincludes co-training with web-scale vision-language data, efficient fine-tuning\nfrom human trajectory data collected via VR devices, and effective imitation\nlearning with robot trajectory data. In addition, we introduce ByteMini, a\nversatile bi-manual mobile robot designed with exceptional flexibility and\nreliability, capable of accomplishing a wide range of tasks when integrated\nwith GR-3. Through extensive real-world experiments, we show GR-3 surpasses the\nstate-of-the-art baseline method, $\\pi_0$, on a wide variety of challenging\ntasks.

        "summary": "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences provide rich spatial and frequency\ndomain information, which is crucial for accurate lesion classification in\nmedical imaging. However, effectively integrating multi-sequence MRI data for\nrobust 3D lesion classification remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose\nDeSamba (Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Network and Mamba-Based Model), a novel\nframework designed to extract decoupled representations and adaptively fuse\nspatial and spectral features for lesion classification. DeSamba introduces a\nDecoupled Representation Learning Module (DRLM) that decouples features from\ndifferent MRI sequences through self-reconstruction and cross-reconstruction,\nand a Spectral Adaptive Modulation Block (SAMB) within the proposed SAMNet,\nenabling dynamic fusion of spectral and spatial information based on lesion\ncharacteristics. We evaluate DeSamba on two clinically relevant 3D datasets. On\na six-class spinal metastasis dataset (n=1,448), DeSamba achieves 62.10% Top-1\naccuracy, 63.62% F1-score, 87.71% AUC, and 93.55% Top-3 accuracy on an external\nvalidation set (n=372), outperforming all state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. On\na spondylitis dataset (n=251) involving a challenging binary classification\ntask, DeSamba achieves 70.00%/64.52% accuracy and 74.75/73.88 AUC on internal\nand external validation sets, respectively. Ablation studies demonstrate that\nboth DRLM and SAMB significantly contribute to overall performance, with over\n10% relative improvement compared to the baseline. Our results highlight the\npotential of DeSamba as a generalizable and effective solution for 3D lesion\nclassification in multi-sequence medical imaging.",

Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for\nachieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a\npartial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the\nshape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within\nthe local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending\nalgorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a\nprogression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate\nblending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited\nversion, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing\nthe need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion.\nExtensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques\nacross a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original\nshape and also adherence to the textual description.",

To address this, we introduce\nEndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with\nmask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic\nenvironments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference\nResetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with\ndynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while\nmaintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification\n(HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores\nusing a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization\ndespite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive\nsoftening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that\nmodulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement,\nor distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force\nattenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical\nscenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while\ndistance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow\nconditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four\ndifferent surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including\nocclusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.\nQuantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations\ndemonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in\nboth magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness\nacross challenging surgical conditions.

        "title": "In-context Learning of Vision Language Models for Detection of Physical and Digital Attacks against Face Recognition Systems",
        "summary": "Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the\ndetection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection\nmethods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks\non face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital\napproaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence\nagainst such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in\nscenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to\ndifferent types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These\nsubsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable\nperformance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges,\nincluding privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse\nattack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the\napplication of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning\nframework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing\nattacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first\nsystematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in\nsecurity-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is\nestablished. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available\ndatabases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive\nperformance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of\nthe traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental\nresults validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving\ngeneralisation in attack detection.",

        "summary": "In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation,\nparticularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are\nincreasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that\npreserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design\nworkflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require\neither per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training\nspecialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.\nSuch dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their\npractical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully\nleverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers\n(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this\ngap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates\nDiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal\nattention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while\npreserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis\nof DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly\nimproves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully\nunlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse\ncontexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to\napproaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework\ndemonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and\ncontrol modules, facilitating more compelling experiences.

        "summary": "Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for\nfeature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven\nespecially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending\ngenerative models. However, generative models perform better in image\ngeneration and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a\nconnection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the\nrepresentation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by\napproximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a\nsemantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for\nrecognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the\ndiffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition\nmodel. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of\nmask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and\ndiffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to\nincorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked\ntokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to\nfurther enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study\nto confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes\nwill be released soon in public.",

MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large\nnumber of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh\nmodels with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.\nThe key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of\nmesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is\nachieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D\nvertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the\nstructure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,\na denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)\nMamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape\nand pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can\ngenerate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and\noutperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.\nAdditionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric\nhuman mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses\nusing around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,\nwhile achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.",

Although recent advances in multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon\nvisual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in\ntraining large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural\nannotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics\neffectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to\nexplicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when\ncompared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce\nAuxiliary Task Augmentation.

        "summary": "Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses\nsignificant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous\nmonitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In\nparticular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only\nmilliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs\noperations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the\ncritical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in\nthe challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual\nobstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of\nspecialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance\nsystems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first\ncomprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated\nbleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with\n39,755 pseudo-labeled frames.

        "summary": "Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual\naesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety\nand complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and\nevolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of\nspecialized image generators (\\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative\nmodels (\\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a\nnatural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and\nediting? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative\nmodels' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We\nincorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our\nevaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR\ngenerative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into\nfive categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and\ncomplex \\& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six\nmodels across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,\nhigh-quality image inputs and prompts.

        "summary": "Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in\nreconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the\nwidely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While\nfrequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on\nFourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards\ndetrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency\nregularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional\nspatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL\nsubbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband\nin a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS\nconsistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric\nstrategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.",

Recently,\ndiffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though\ntheir advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we\nsystematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where\ntraining involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they\nsignificantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.\nDiffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation\nloss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as\nimplicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse\ndistribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed\nleft-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and\nderive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which\ndiffusion begins to outperform AR.

Current\nreinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as\nhit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature\nof spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally\nforms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI\nGaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that\nmodels GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface\nplane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point\nrewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions\ncentered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment\nby measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target\nregions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance\nmechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.\nThis framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to\ndense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich\ngradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.\nExtensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro\nbenchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of\n24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro.

In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with\nLow-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both\nenhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In\ntraining, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank\nfactorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.\nThese features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves\nshared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.\nSubsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI\nclass and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction\nrepresentations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight\nadaptation with LLM-derived action regularization.

        "summary": "Enabling efficient text-video retrieval on edge-end devices is critical for\nreal-world applications. Yet, existing methods face a critical challenge in\nbalancing accuracy and computational efficiency: uniform frame sampling methods\nensure content coverage but incur prohibitive computational costs, while\nsalient-frame sampling methods reduce overhead but suffer from query-agnostic\nframe selection that biases retrieval results. To address this, we propose\nProCLIP, a user-centric framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with\nsignificantly improved efficiency. We design a prompt-aware frame sampling\nstrategy that dynamically guides lightweight feature extractors using textual\nprompts to select semantically relevant frames, overcoming the limitations of\nexisting salient-frame sampling methods which rely on static, query-agnostic\nselection criteria. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage candidate pruning strategy\nthat combines rapid coarse filtering via a lightweight module with CLIP-powered\nfine-grained re-ranking, enhancing retrieval efficiency while preserving\naccuracy. Experiments across benchmarks show ProCLIP achieves 75.3% latency\nreduction versus baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, i.e.,\nR@1=49.0 in MSR-VTT dataset.

        "summary": "Autonomous quadrotor flight in confined spaces such as pipes and tunnels\npresents significant challenges due to unsteady, self-induced aerodynamic\ndisturbances. Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but\nthey either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow\nrecirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this\nwork, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for\nhovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We\ndevelop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates\nlocal airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a\ndisturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which\ninfers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances\nare integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement\nlearning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during\nlateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time\ndisturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract\ntransient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe\nwall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first\ndemonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time\nflow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in\naerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on\nthe characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow,\ncircular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and\nfluid dynamics.",

While Late gadolinium\nenhancement (LGE) MRI is the clinical gold standard for infarct detection, it\nrequires contrast agents, introducing side effects and patient discomfort.\nMoreover, infarct reconstruction from LGE often relies on sparsely sampled 2D\nslices, limiting spatial resolution and accuracy. In this work, we propose a\nnovel framework for automatically reconstructing high-fidelity 3D myocardial\ninfarct geometry from 2D clinically standard cine MRI, eliminating the need for\ncontrast agents. Specifically, we first reconstruct the 4D biventricular mesh\nfrom multi-view cine MRIs via an automatic deep shape fitting model, biv-me.\nThen, we design a infarction reconstruction model, CMotion2Infarct-Net, to\nexplicitly utilize the motion patterns within this dynamic geometry to localize\ninfarct regions. Evaluated on 205 cine MRI scans from 126 MI patients, our\nmethod shows reasonable agreement with manual delineation.

It\nmay also help infer genetic clusters, reducing reliance on expensive testing.\nThis study systematically evaluates anatomical priors to identify\nconfigurations that improve deep learning-based PCC segmentation. We employed\nthe nnU-Net framework to evaluate eleven annotation strategies for accurate 3D\nsegmentation of pheochromocytoma, introducing a set of novel multi-class\nschemes based on organ-specific anatomical priors. These priors were derived\nfrom adjacent organs commonly surrounding adrenal tumors (e.g., liver, spleen,\nkidney, aorta, adrenal gland, and pancreas), and were compared against a broad\nbody-region prior used in previous work. The framework was trained and tested\non 105 contrast-enhanced CT scans from 91 patients at the NIH Clinical Center.\nPerformance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Normalized\nSurface Distance (NSD), and instance-wise F1 score. Among all strategies, the\nTumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA) annotation achieved the highest segmentation\naccuracy, significantly outperforming the previously used Tumor + Body (TB)\nannotation across DSC (p = 0.0097), NSD (p = 0.0110), and F1 score (25.84%\nimprovement at an IoU threshold of 0.5), measured on a 70-30 train-test split.\nThe TKA model also showed superior tumor burden quantification (R^2 = 0.968)\nand strong segmentation across all genetic subtypes. In five-fold\ncross-validation, TKA consistently outperformed TB across IoU thresholds (0.1\nto 0.5), reinforcing its robustness and generalizability.

        "summary": "Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring\nmodels to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable\nadvances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human\ncapabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex\nscene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance\nmatching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that\nenables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,\nwe propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that\nshifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and\nutilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,\nconstructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a\ncomprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,\nrealizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively\nbalances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,\ndynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To\nrigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual\nreasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex\nScenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160\nmanually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with\nsubstantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In\nparticular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,\nestablishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.",

        "summary": "Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs\nattention and fixation to task-relevant regions and dramatically reduces visual\nprocessing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive,\nuniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how\nincorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both\nefficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image\nprocessing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both\nhuman head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA\nrobot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously\ncollecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as\nwell as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that\nincorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)\nin robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated\npatch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.\nCompared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number\nof tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions\nof interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction\nfrom human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide\nfoveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,\nallowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results\nshow that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces\ncomputational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks\nand robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that\nhuman-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic\nvision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/",

        "summary": "Surface defect detection of steel, especially the recognition of multi-scale\ndefects, has always been a major challenge in industrial manufacturing. Steel\nsurfaces not only have defects of various sizes and shapes, which limit the\naccuracy of traditional image processing and detection methods in complex\nenvironments. However, traditional defect detection methods face issues of\ninsufficient accuracy and high miss-detection rates when dealing with small\ntarget defects. To address this issue, this study proposes a detection\nframework based on deep learning, specifically YOLOv9s, combined with the\nC3Ghost module, SCConv module, and CARAFE upsampling operator, to improve\ndetection accuracy and model performance. First, the SCConv module is used to\nreduce feature redundancy and optimize feature representation by reconstructing\nthe spatial and channel dimensions. Second, the C3Ghost module is introduced to\nenhance the model's feature extraction ability by reducing redundant\ncomputations and parameter volume, thereby improving model efficiency. Finally,\nthe CARAFE upsampling operator, which can more finely reorganize feature maps\nin a content-aware manner, optimizes the upsampling process and ensures\ndetailed restoration of high-resolution defect regions. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher accuracy and robustness in\nsteel surface defect detection tasks compared to other methods, effectively\naddressing defect detection problems.",

        "summary": "Fingerprint matching under diverse capture conditions remains a fundamental\nchallenge in biometric recognition. To achieve robust and accurate performance\nin such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense\nrepresentation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and\ndiscriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.\nSpecifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and\noriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where\ntwo dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the\nthird encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures\nabstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained\ndescription that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their\nsurrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial\ncorrespondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground\nsegmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions. During matching,\ncomparisons are then restricted to overlapping foreground areas, improving\nefficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on rolled, plain, parital,\ncontactless, and latent fingerprint datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and\ngeneralizability of the proposed method.

While it has shown good performance, its\nimplementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be\nchallenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each\nmedical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image\nprocessing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that\ndynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank\nrepresentation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value\ndecomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,\nand tackle it with a proximal optimizer.

Especially when facial information is partially\noccluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,\nleading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which\nintroduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary\nmulti-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn\nhigh-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic\nsegmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced\nfacial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric\nprior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.\nSecond, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal\npriors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively\nfuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within\ndifferent scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement\nLoss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,\nfurther enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We\nfurther construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate\nspecialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,\ndubbed Occlu-FER.

        "summary": "Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most\ninformative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in\nresource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which\nfocus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the\nlearning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of\nActive Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that\ncharacterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,\ncoverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a\npredictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the\nestimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across\ndifferent strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on\nCIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and\nself-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes\neffectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting\nfull learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals\ncrucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the\nscalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective\nstrategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays\nthe basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of\nAL in both research and real-world applications.

The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to\nsupervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on\n2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise\nand outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the\neffectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind\nPnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated\nblind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high\ncomputational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of\nminimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called\nMinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task\nlearning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the\nexisting I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes,\nRGBD-V2, ScanNet, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher inlier ratio (IR)\nand registration recall (RR) in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.",

Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space\nModeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the\neffective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In\nSCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the\nlearning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce\nthe Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in\nchannels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM\nmodule enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature\nrepresentation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.",

A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that\nupdating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to\nthe scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new\nconcept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts.\nAdditionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with\nSelf-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to\nprepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The\nproposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the\nextreme domain shift scenario of the BSCD-FSL benchmark.

In this paper, we\npresent a preliminary study of Active Learning (AL) and Sequential Learning\n(SL) tailored for object detection and layout recognition in an old medieval\nmusic manuscript. Leveraging YOLOv8, our system selects samples with the\nhighest uncertainty (lowest prediction confidence) for iterative labeling and\nretraining. Our approach starts with a single annotated image and successfully\nboosts performance while minimizing manual labeling. Experimental results\nindicate that comparable accuracy to fully supervised training can be achieved\nwith significantly fewer labeled examples. We test the methodology as a\npreliminary investigation on a novel dataset offered to the community by the\nAnonymous project, which studies laude, a poetical-musical genre spread across\nItaly during the 12th-16th Century. We show that in the manuscript at-hand,\nuncertainty-based AL is not effective and advocates for more usable methods in\ndata-scarcity scenarios.",

In this\nwork, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast\nimaging by analyzing {Mammo-CLIP}, a vision--language foundation model\npretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level\n\\texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features\nassociated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \\textit{mass} and\n\\textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class\nlevel latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground\ntruth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the\nmodel's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons\nthe model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast\nconcept prediction. This study highlights the promise of interpretable SAE\nlatent representations in providing deeper insight into the internal workings\nof foundation models at every layer for breast imaging.",

        "summary": "Anemia is a widespread global health issue, particularly among young children\nin low-resource settings. Traditional methods for anemia detection often\nrequire expensive equipment and expert knowledge, creating barriers to early\nand accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we explore the use of deep\nlearning models for detecting anemia through conjunctival pallor, focusing on\nthe CP-AnemiC dataset, which includes 710 images from children aged 6-59\nmonths. The dataset is annotated with hemoglobin levels, gender, age and other\ndemographic data, enabling the development of machine learning models for\naccurate anemia detection. We use the MobileNet architecture as a backbone,\nknown for its efficiency in mobile and embedded vision applications, and\nfine-tune our model end-to-end using data augmentation techniques and a\ncross-validation strategy. Our model implementation achieved an accuracy of\n0.9313, a precision of 0.9374, and an F1 score of 0.9773 demonstrating strong\nperformance on the dataset. To optimize the model for deployment on edge\ndevices, we performed post-training quantization, evaluating the impact of\ndifferent bit-widths (FP32, FP16, INT8, and INT4) on model performance.\nPreliminary results suggest that while FP16 quantization maintains high\naccuracy (0.9250), precision (0.9370), and F1 Score (0.9377), more aggressive\nquantization (INT8 and INT4) leads to significant performance degradation.\nOverall, our study supports further exploration of quantization schemes and\nhardware optimizations to assess trade-offs between model size, inference time,\nand diagnostic accuracy in mobile healthcare applications.",
