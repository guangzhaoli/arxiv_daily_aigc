        "summary": "Despite the promise of Multi-Task Learning in leveraging complementary\nknowledge across tasks, existing multi-task optimization (MTO) techniques\nremain fixated on resolving conflicts via optimizer-centric loss scaling and\ngradient manipulation strategies, yet fail to deliver consistent gains. In this\npaper, we argue that the shared representation space, where task interactions\nnaturally occur, offers rich information and potential for operations\ncomplementary to existing optimizers, especially for facilitating the\ninter-task complementarity, which is rarely explored in MTO. This intuition\nleads to Rep-MTL, which exploits the representation-level task saliency to\nquantify interactions between task-specific optimization and shared\nrepresentation learning. By steering these saliencies through entropy-based\npenalization and sample-wise cross-task alignment, Rep-MTL aims to mitigate\nnegative transfer by maintaining the effective training of individual tasks\ninstead pure conflict-solving, while explicitly promoting complementary\ninformation sharing. Experiments are conducted on four challenging MTL\nbenchmarks covering both task-shift and domain-shift scenarios. The results\nshow that Rep-MTL, even paired with the basic equal weighting policy, achieves\ncompetitive performance gains with favorable efficiency. Beyond standard\nperformance metrics, Power Law exponent analysis demonstrates Rep-MTL's\nefficacy in balancing task-specific learning and cross-task sharing.

        "summary": "Reconstructing 4D spatial intelligence from visual observations has long been\na central yet challenging task in computer vision, with broad real-world\napplications. These range from entertainment domains like movies, where the\nfocus is often on reconstructing fundamental visual elements, to embodied AI,\nwhich emphasizes interaction modeling and physical realism. Fueled by rapid\nadvances in 3D representations and deep learning architectures, the field has\nevolved quickly, outpacing the scope of previous surveys. Additionally,\nexisting surveys rarely offer a comprehensive analysis of the hierarchical\nstructure of 4D scene reconstruction. To address this gap, we present a new\nperspective that organizes existing methods into five progressive levels of 4D\nspatial intelligence: (1) Level 1 -- reconstruction of low-level 3D attributes\n(e.g., depth, pose, and point maps); (2) Level 2 -- reconstruction of 3D scene\ncomponents (e.g., objects, humans, structures); (3) Level 3 -- reconstruction\nof 4D dynamic scenes; (4) Level 4 -- modeling of interactions among scene\ncomponents; and (5) Level 5 -- incorporation of physical laws and constraints.\nWe conclude the survey by discussing the key challenges at each level and\nhighlighting promising directions for advancing toward even richer levels of 4D\nspatial intelligence.

However, the\nproprietary nature of these models and their training data creates a\nsignificant barrier for open-source research. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nGPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M, a publicly available, large-scale image-editing corpus\ncontaining more than 1.5 million high-quality triplets (instruction, source\nimage, edited image). We systematically construct this dataset by leveraging\nthe versatile capabilities of GPT-4o to unify and refine three popular\nimage-editing datasets: OmniEdit, HQ-Edit, and UltraEdit. Specifically, our\nmethodology involves 1) regenerating output images to enhance visual quality\nand instruction alignment, and 2) selectively rewriting prompts to improve\nsemantic clarity. To validate the efficacy of our dataset, we fine-tune\nadvanced open-source models on GPT-IMAGE-EDIT-1.5M. The empirical results are\nexciting, e.g., the fine-tuned FluxKontext achieves highly competitive\nperformance across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including 7.24 on\nGEdit-EN, 3.80 on ImgEdit-Full, and 8.78 on Complex-Edit, showing stronger\ninstruction following and higher perceptual quality while maintaining identity.\nThese scores markedly exceed all previously published open-source methods and\nsubstantially narrow the gap to leading proprietary models.

        "summary": "Current facial emotion recognition systems are predominately trained to\npredict a fixed set of predefined categories or abstract dimensional values.\nThis constrained form of supervision hinders generalization and applicability,\nas it reduces the rich and nuanced spectrum of emotions into oversimplified\nlabels or scales. In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,\nexpressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much\nbroader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural\nlanguage captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation\nlearning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:\n1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and\n2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich\nsupervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion\ncaption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured\nsemantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and\nfine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further\npropose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive\nlearning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.\nThis design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption\ninformation while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related\nexpressions.

Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between\nmodel accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we\npresent a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive\nlearning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple\nclones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool\nof perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,\nthese adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the\nlearning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge\ndistillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an\nadaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each\nmodel by assigning weights as per their prediction precision. Distilling\nknowledge from adversarially pre-trained teacher models not only enhances the\nlearning capabilities of the student model but also empowers it with the\ncapacity to withstand different adversarial attacks, despite having no exposure\nto adversarial data. To verify our claims, we extensively evaluated our\nproposed method on MNIST-Digits and Fashion-MNIST datasets across diverse\nexperimental settings. The obtained results exhibit the efficacy of our\nmulti-teacher adversarial distillation and adaptive learning strategy,\nenhancing CNNs' adversarial robustness against various adversarial attacks.",

However, the safety\nmechanisms developed for text-based LLMs do not naturally extend to visual\nmodalities, leaving LVLMs vulnerable to harmful image inputs. To address this\ncross-modal safety gap, we introduce security tensors - trainable input vectors\napplied during inference through either the textual or visual modality. These\ntensors transfer textual safety alignment to visual processing without\nmodifying the model's parameters. They are optimized using a curated dataset\ncontaining (i) malicious image-text pairs requiring rejection, (ii) contrastive\nbenign pairs with text structurally similar to malicious queries, with the\npurpose of being contrastive examples to guide visual reliance, and (iii)\ngeneral benign samples preserving model functionality. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that both textual and visual security tensors significantly enhance\nLVLMs' ability to reject diverse harmful visual inputs while maintaining\nnear-identical performance on benign tasks. Further internal analysis towards\nhidden-layer representations reveals that security tensors successfully\nactivate the language module's textual \"safety layers\" in visual inputs,\nthereby effectively extending text-based safety to the visual modality.",

This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic\nframework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches\nthat rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require\nmodel-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates\ndirectly within the feature space without retraining or architectural\nmodifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender\nbias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the\nsparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased\ndirection per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed\nduring inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs.\nTrained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing\ndirection, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased\nsubspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable\nDiffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially\nreduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying\nand intervening in gender bias within T2I models.

        "title": "Mask-Free Audio-driven Talking Face Generation for Enhanced Visual Quality and Identity Preservation",
        "summary": "Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation aims at generating realistic videos of\ntalking faces, focusing on accurate audio-lip synchronization without\ndeteriorating any identity-related visual details. Recent state-of-the-art\nmethods are based on inpainting, meaning that the lower half of the input face\nis masked, and the model fills the masked region by generating lips aligned\nwith the given audio. Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from\nthe lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity\nreference image randomly selected from the same video. However, this common\nmasking strategy suffers from (1) information loss in the input faces,\nsignificantly affecting the networks' ability to preserve visual quality and\nidentity details, (2) variation between identity reference and input image\ndegrading reconstruction performance, and (3) the identity reference negatively\nimpacting the model, causing unintended copying of elements unaligned with the\naudio. To address these issues, we propose a mask-free talking face generation\napproach while maintaining the 2D-based face editing task. Instead of masking\nthe lower half, we transform the input images to have closed mouths, using a\ntwo-step landmark-based approach trained in an unpaired manner. Subsequently,\nwe provide these edited but unmasked faces to a lip adaptation model alongside\nthe audio to generate appropriate lip movements. Thus, our approach needs\nneither masked input images nor identity reference images. We conduct\nexperiments on the benchmark LRS2 and HDTF datasets and perform various\nablation studies to validate our contributions.",

        "summary": "Real-world user-generated short videos, especially those distributed on\nplatforms such as WeChat Channel and TikTok, dominate the mobile internet.\nHowever, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured,\ndetailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the\ncornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging\nvideo applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due\nto their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and\naudio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint\ndelivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal\ninformation, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce\nARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual\nsignals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The\nmodel is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and\nsummarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding,\nand video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation\npipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive\nregimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement\nlearning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative\nevaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative\ncomparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video\ncomprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for\ndiverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our\nmodel has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and\nsatisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress\ntests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on\nH20 GPU.",

        "summary": "Attribute-based document image retrieval (ABDIR) was recently proposed as an\nalternative to query-by-example (QBE) searches, the dominant document image\nretrieval (DIR) paradigm. One drawback of QBE searches is that they require\nsample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer\nusers a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual\nfeatures of document contents, describing document images with combinations of\nvisual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nbinary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI\nto bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a\nuse case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize\nthat text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document\nimages using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE,\nwhich uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough\ndescription of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style\nattributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional\nQBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the\ndocument images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents.\nExperiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our\nhypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document\nimage retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at\nutilizing T2I generation for DIR.",

        "summary": "Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects\nbased on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in\nvision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing\napplications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.\nExisting datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and\nstatic-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD\nviews, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we\npresent RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD\nscenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask\ntriplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,\ncluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in\nprevious benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object\ndrift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the\nSemantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly\ninjecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic\ninformation to different stages of the network. Specifically, the\nCategory-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with\nobject categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion\nModule (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve\nreasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD\npresents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these\nchallenges.

Conventional\nmethods, which rely on simple classification objectives, often fail to learn\ndomain-invariant representations. We propose HAMLET-FFD, a cognitively inspired\nHierarchical Adaptive Multi-modal Learning framework that tackles this\nchallenge via bidirectional cross-modal reasoning. Building on contrastive\nvision-language models such as CLIP, HAMLET-FFD introduces a knowledge\nrefinement loop that iteratively assesses authenticity by integrating visual\nevidence with conceptual cues, emulating expert forensic analysis. A key\ninnovation is a bidirectional fusion mechanism in which textual authenticity\nembeddings guide the aggregation of hierarchical visual features, while\nmodulated visual features refine text embeddings to generate image-adaptive\nprompts. This closed-loop process progressively aligns visual observations with\nsemantic priors to enhance authenticity assessment. By design, HAMLET-FFD\nfreezes all pretrained parameters, serving as an external plugin that preserves\nCLIP's original capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior\ngeneralization to unseen manipulations across multiple benchmarks, and visual\nanalyses reveal a division of labor among embeddings, with distinct\nrepresentations specializing in fine-grained artifact recognition.",

        "summary": "Ensuring reliable model performance across diverse domains is a critical\nchallenge in computational pathology. A particular source of variability in\nWhole-Slide Images is introduced by differences in digital scanners, thus\ncalling for better scanner generalization. This is critical for the real-world\nadoption of computational pathology, where the scanning devices may differ per\ninstitution or hospital, and the model should not be dependent on\nscanner-induced details, which can ultimately affect the patient's diagnosis\nand treatment planning. However, past efforts have primarily focused on\nstandard domain generalization settings, evaluating on unseen scanners during\ntraining, without directly evaluating consistency across scanners for the same\ntissue. To overcome this limitation, we introduce SCORPION, a new dataset\nexplicitly designed to evaluate model reliability under scanner variability.\nSCORPION includes 480 tissue samples, each scanned with 5 scanners, yielding\n2,400 spatially aligned patches. This scanner-paired design allows for the\nisolation of scanner-induced variability, enabling a rigorous evaluation of\nmodel consistency while controlling for differences in tissue composition.\nFurthermore, we propose SimCons, a flexible framework that combines\naugmentation-based domain generalization techniques with a consistency loss to\nexplicitly address scanner generalization. We empirically show that SimCons\nimproves model consistency on varying scanners without compromising\ntask-specific performance. By releasing the SCORPION dataset and proposing\nSimCons, we provide the research community with a crucial resource for\nevaluating and improving model consistency across diverse scanners, setting a\nnew standard for reliability testing.",

        "title": "Ensemble Foreground Management for Unsupervised Object Discovery",
        "summary": "Unsupervised object discovery (UOD) aims to detect and segment objects in 2D\nimages without handcrafted annotations. Recent progress in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the\nabsence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)\ndetermining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing\nhow many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous\nsolutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is\nforeground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the\nexisting foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed\nnumber of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of\nobjects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and\nwell-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that\ndetects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to\nidentify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the\nforeground union in the image is segmented.

        "summary": "We present a novel framework for compositional video synthesis that leverages\ntemporally consistent object-centric representations, extending our previous\nwork, SlotAdapt, from images to video. While existing object-centric approaches\neither lack generative capabilities entirely or treat video sequences\nholistically, thus neglecting explicit object-level structure, our approach\nexplicitly captures temporal dynamics by learning pose invariant object-centric\nslots and conditioning them on pretrained diffusion models. This design enables\nhigh-quality, pixel-level video synthesis with superior temporal coherence, and\noffers intuitive compositional editing capabilities such as object insertion,\ndeletion, or replacement, maintaining consistent object identities across\nframes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets new benchmarks\nin video generation quality and temporal consistency, outperforming previous\nobject-centric generative methods. Although our segmentation performance\nclosely matches state-of-the-art methods, our approach uniquely integrates this\ncapability with robust generative performance, significantly advancing\ninteractive and controllable video generation and opening new possibilities for\nadvanced content creation, semantic editing, and dynamic scene understanding.",

We argue that this mode of\nevaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization\nability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP\nmodel, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve\nthis, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true\ninductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a\nsignificant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with\nmultiple datasets).

Subsequent investigations into\nenhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their\nperformance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of\nMLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated\nimage-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework\ntermed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to\nlearn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on\nthe ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the\nrendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We\ndemonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for\noptimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on\nthe image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a\nclosed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual\nfeedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through\nmulti-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be\noptimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments\non image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF\nsubstantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised\nfine-tuning baselines.

        "title": "ATR-UMMIM: A Benchmark Dataset for UAV-Based Multimodal Image Registration under Complex Imaging Conditions",
        "summary": "Multimodal fusion has become a key enabler for UAV-based object detection, as\neach modality provides complementary cues for robust feature extraction.\nHowever, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and\nsensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a\nprerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no\npublicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration\nin UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and\nevaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To\nbridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically\ntailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This\ndataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely\nregistered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight\naltitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\\deg} to 75{\\deg}, and\nall-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination\nconditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated\nannotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each\ntriplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition\nattributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world\ndeployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide\nobject-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object\ncategories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes. We believe\nATR-UMMIM will serve as a foundational benchmark for advancing multimodal\nregistration, fusion, and perception in real-world UAV scenarios.

        "summary": "Recent transformer based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance\nin solving real-world 3D human pose estimation problems. Albeit these\napproaches achieve fruitful results on benchmark datasets, they tend to fall\nshort of sports scenarios where human movements are more complicated than daily\nlife actions, as being hindered by motion blur, occlusions, and domain shifts.\nMoreover, due to the fact that critical motions in a sports game often finish\nin moments of time (e.g., shooting), the ability to focus on momentary actions\nis becoming a crucial factor in sports analysis, where current methods appear\nto struggle with instantaneous scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we\nintroduce KASportsFormer, a novel transformer based 3D pose estimation\nframework for sports that incorporates a kinematic anatomy-informed feature\nrepresentation and integration module. In which the inherent kinematic motion\ninformation is extracted with the Bone Extractor (BoneExt) and Limb Fuser\n(LimbFus) modules and encoded in a multimodal manner. This improved the\ncapability of comprehending sports poses in short videos. We evaluate our\nmethod through two representative sports scene datasets: SportsPose and\nWorldPose.

        "summary": "Computer vision seeks to infer a wide range of information about objects and\nevents.

For\ninstance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but\nit cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to\nexpand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the\nhidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on\ntheir surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill\nlevel of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical\nmanipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based\nvibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D\ngrid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset\nof vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers. Then, we\ndevelop a transformer-based approach for analyzing the captured vibrations and\nclassifying the container type and its hidden liquid level at the time of\nmeasurement. Our architecture is invariant to the vibration source, yielding\ncorrect liquid level estimates for controlled and ambient scene sound sources.\nMoreover, our model generalizes to unseen container instances within known\nclasses (e.g., training on five Coke cans of a six-pack, testing on a sixth)\nand fluid levels.

        "summary": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate impressive\ncapabilities, their substantial computational and memory requirements pose\nsignificant barriers to practical deployment. Current parameter reduction\ntechniques primarily involve training MLLMs from Small Language Models (SLMs),\nbut these methods offer limited flexibility and remain computationally\nintensive. To address this gap, we propose to directly compress existing MLLMs\nthrough structural pruning combined with efficient recovery training.\nSpecifically, we investigate two structural pruning paradigms--layerwise and\nwidthwise pruning--applied to the language model backbone of MLLMs, alongside\nsupervised finetuning and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we assess the\nfeasibility of conducting recovery training with only a small fraction of the\navailable data. Our results show that widthwise pruning generally maintains\nbetter performance in low-resource scenarios with limited computational\nresources or insufficient finetuning data. As for the recovery training,\nfinetuning only the multimodal projector is sufficient at small compression\nlevels (< 20%). Furthermore, a combination of supervised finetuning and\nhidden-state distillation yields optimal recovery across various pruning\nlevels. Notably, effective recovery can be achieved with as little as 5% of the\noriginal training data, while retaining over 95% of the original performance.\nThrough empirical study on two representative MLLMs, i.e., LLaVA-v1.5-7B and\nBunny-v1.0-3B, this study offers actionable insights for practitioners aiming\nto compress MLLMs effectively without extensive computation resources or\nsufficient data.",

We introduce the multi-granularity implicit text (MIT)\ninvolving video-, segment- and frame-level as the bridge to establish the\nmodality-shared space, reducing modality gaps and providing prior guidance.\nVisual content carries more information and typically dominates, thereby\nmarginalizing audio features in the decision-making.

In this paper, we first identify two critical\ndeficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation\nbias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of\nsupervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak\nconsistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and\nprototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework.

        "title": "Self-Supervised Continuous Colormap Recovery from a 2D Scalar Field Visualization without a Legend",
        "summary": "Recovering a continuous colormap from a single 2D scalar field visualization\ncan be quite challenging, especially in the absence of a corresponding color\nlegend. In this paper, we propose a novel colormap recovery approach that\nextracts the colormap from a color-encoded 2D scalar field visualization by\nsimultaneously predicting the colormap and underlying data using a\ndecoupling-and-reconstruction strategy. Our approach first separates the input\nvisualization into colormap and data using a decoupling module, then\nreconstructs the visualization with a differentiable color-mapping module. To\nguide this process, we design a reconstruction loss between the input and\nreconstructed visualizations, which serves both as a constraint to ensure\nstrong correlation between colormap and data during training, and as a\nself-supervised optimizer for fine-tuning the predicted colormap of unseen\nvisualizations during inferencing. To ensure smoothness and correct color\nordering in the extracted colormap, we introduce a compact colormap\nrepresentation using cubic B-spline curves and an associated color order loss.\nWe evaluate our method quantitatively and qualitatively on a synthetic dataset\nand a collection of real-world visualizations from the VIS30K dataset.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate its utility in two prototype applications --\ncolormap adjustment and colormap transfer -- and explore its generalization to\nvisualizations with color legends and ones encoded using discrete color\npalettes.",

        "title": "TransPrune: Token Transition Pruning for Efficient Large Vision-Language Model",
        "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have advanced multimodal learning but\nface high computational costs due to the large number of visual tokens,\nmotivating token pruning to improve inference efficiency. The key challenge\nlies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches\nrely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they\ninherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this\nwork, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token\ntransitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations\nprovides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we\npropose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.\nSpecifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their\nimportance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which\nmeasures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token\nrepresentations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how\nstrongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal\nperformance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight\nbenchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV\nalone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,\nachieving performance comparable to attention-based methods.

        "summary": "The goal of video anomaly detection is tantamount to performing\nspatio-temporal localization of abnormal events in the video. The multiscale\ntemporal dependencies, visual-semantic heterogeneity, and the scarcity of\nlabeled data exhibited by video anomalies collectively present a challenging\nresearch problem in computer vision. This study offers a dual-path architecture\ncalled the Dual-Branch Adaptive Multiscale Spatiotemporal Framework (DAMS),\nwhich is based on multilevel feature decoupling and fusion, enabling efficient\nanomaly detection modeling by integrating hierarchical feature learning and\ncomplementary information. The main processing path of this framework\nintegrates the Adaptive Multiscale Time Pyramid Network (AMTPN) with the\nConvolutional Block Attention Mechanism (CBAM). AMTPN enables multigrained\nrepresentation and dynamically weighted reconstruction of temporal features\nthrough a three-level cascade structure (time pyramid pooling, adaptive feature\nfusion, and temporal context enhancement). CBAM maximizes the entropy\ndistribution of feature channels and spatial dimensions through dual attention\nmapping. Simultaneously, the parallel path driven by CLIP introduces a\ncontrastive language-visual pre-training paradigm. Cross-modal semantic\nalignment and a multiscale instance selection mechanism provide high-order\nsemantic guidance for spatio-temporal features. This creates a complete\ninference chain from the underlying spatio-temporal features to high-level\nsemantic concepts. The orthogonal complementarity of the two paths and the\ninformation fusion mechanism jointly construct a comprehensive representation\nand identification capability for anomalous events. Extensive experimental\nresults on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence benchmarks establish the effectiveness\nof the DAMS framework.",

Over time, three major classes of methods have emerged, including\nMSE-based, GAN-based, and diffusion-based methods.

We theoretically demonstrate that\ninitializing adversarial training from a pre-trained diffusion model positions\nthe initial restoration model very close to the natural image distribution.\nConsequently, this initialization improves numerical stability, avoids mode\ncollapse, and substantially accelerates the convergence of adversarial\ntraining. Moreover, HYPIR inherits the capabilities of diffusion models with\nrich user control, enabling text-guided restoration and adjustable texture\nrichness.

As a result, our\nMemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without\nadditional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as\nwell as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance\nenhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.",

        "summary": "Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, low-intensity, often localized facial\nexpressions. They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to\nconceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological\ncounseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small\nsample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.\nAdditionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving\nthe task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints\nlargely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research\nframework. We begin with a psychological study on the coordination of upper and\nlower facial action units (AUs) to provide structured prior knowledge of facial\nmuscle dynamics. We then develop a DPK-GAT network that combines these\npsychological priors with statistical AU patterns, enabling hierarchical\nlearning of facial motion features from regional to global levels, effectively\nenhancing MER performance. Additionally, our federated learning framework\nadvances MER capabilities across multiple clients without data sharing,\npreserving privacy and alleviating the limited-sample issue for each client.\nExtensive experiments on commonly-used ME databases demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach.",

        "summary": "As lovely as bunnies are, your sketched version would probably not do them\njustice (Fig.~\\ref{fig:intro}). This paper recognises this very problem and\nstudies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these\nbadly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$\nnorm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose\nGeometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes\nfeature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without\nthe need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature\nmagnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be\nsimultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with\ntheoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the\nbetter the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both\nnetwork architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through\na large scale human study of 160,000 \\doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the\nagreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We\nfurther demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first\ntime enable three practical sketch applications. Interestingly, we show GACL\nnot only works on abstract visual representations such as sketch but also\nextends well to natural images on the problem of image quality assessment\n(IQA). Last but not least, we spell out the general properties of GACL as\ngeneral-purpose data re-weighting strategy and demonstrate its applications in\nvertical problems such as noisy label cleansing.

        "summary": "Text-to-Image (T2I) generative models have revolutionized content creation\nbut remain highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, often requiring users to\nrepeatedly refine prompts multiple times without clear feedback. While\ntechniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,\ndenoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited\ncontrollability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input\nInterpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates\na standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate\nmodel from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual\nprompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses\naesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for\npotential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also\nsupporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control. On\nGenAI-Bench, using open-source generation models, T2I-Copilot achieves a VQA\nscore comparable to commercial models RecraftV3 and Imagen 3, surpasses\nFLUX1.1-pro by 6.17% at only 16.59% of its cost, and outperforms FLUX.1-dev and\nSD 3.5 Large by 9.11% and 6.36%.

In\nthe spatial visual thinking phase, our model is trained to generate\nlocation-related specific tokens of essential targets automatically.

During the spatial textual\nthinking phase, Our model conducts long-term thinking based on visual cues and\ndialogues, gradually inferring the answers to spatial reasoning problems. To\neffectively support the model's training, we perform manual corrections to the\nexisting spatial reasoning dataset, eliminating numerous incorrect labels\nresulting from automatic annotation, restructuring the data input format to\nenhance generalization ability, and developing thinking processes with logical\nreasoning details.

Due to the impressive general\nmultimodal knowledge demonstrated by image-text pretrained models such as CLIP,\nexisting work has primarily focused on extending CLIP knowledge for video-text\ntasks. However, videos typically contain richer information than images. In\ncurrent video-text datasets, textual descriptions can only reflect a portion of\nthe video content, leading to partial misalignment in video-text matching.\nTherefore, directly aligning text representations with video representations\ncan result in incorrect supervision, ignoring the inequivalence of information.\nIn this work, we propose T2VParser to extract multiview semantic\nrepresentations from text and video, achieving adaptive semantic alignment\nrather than aligning the entire representation. To extract corresponding\nrepresentations from different modalities, we introduce Adaptive Decomposition\nTokens, which consist of a set of learnable tokens shared across modalities.\nThe goal of T2VParser is to emphasize precise alignment between text and video\nwhile retaining the knowledge of pretrained models.

First, we extract geometric skeletons across multiple scenes and\nleverage ellipsoid-aware convolution to capture 3D-GS attributes, facilitating\nrobust scene registration. Second, we introduce a multi-factor Gaussian fusion\nstrategy to mitigate the scene element loss caused by rigid thresholding.\nExperiments on the ScanNet-GSReg and our Coord datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method in registration and fusion. For\nregistration, it achieves a 41.9\\% reduction in RRE on complex scenes, ensuring\nmore precise pose estimation. For fusion, it improves PSNR by 10.11 dB,\nhighlighting superior structural preservation. These results confirm its\nability to enhance scene alignment and reconstruction fidelity, ensuring more\nconsistent and accurate 3D scene representation for robotic perception and\nautonomous navigation.",

        "summary": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is increasingly being used as a support tool\nwithin clinical settings for pathological diagnosis decisions, achieving high\nperformance and removing the annotation burden. However, existing approaches\nfor clinical MIL tasks have not adequately addressed the priority issues that\nexist in relation to pathological symptoms and diagnostic classes, causing MIL\nmodels to ignore priority among classes. To overcome this clinical limitation\nof MIL, we propose a new method that addresses priority issues using two\nhierarchies: vertical inter-hierarchy and horizontal intra-hierarchy. The\nproposed method aligns MIL predictions across each hierarchical level and\nemploys an implicit feature re-usability during training to facilitate\nclinically more serious classes within the same level. Experiments with\nreal-world patient data show that the proposed method effectively reduces\nmisdiagnosis and prioritizes more important symptoms in multiclass scenarios.\nFurther analysis verifies the efficacy of the proposed components and\nqualitatively confirms the MIL predictions against challenging cases with\nmultiple symptoms.",

        "summary": "Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm,\nexhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over\ntraditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by\nprogressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the\ncomputational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge\ndue to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce\nSparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction\nthat dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without\nrequiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation\nthat tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality\nin high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring\ntokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale\nprediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on\nhigh-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing\nlightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving\nthe fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled\nanchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while\nmaintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable\nacceleration in both HART and Infinity.

        "summary": "Gestural language is used by deaf & mute communities to communicate through\nhand gestures & body movements that rely on visual-spatial patterns known as\nsign languages. Sign languages, which rely on visual-spatial patterns of hand\ngestures & body movements, are the primary mode of communication for deaf &\nmute communities worldwide. Effective communication is fundamental to human\ninteraction, yet individuals in these communities often face significant\nbarriers due to a scarcity of skilled interpreters & accessible translation\ntechnologies. This research specifically addresses these challenges within the\nIndian context by focusing on Indian Sign Language (ISL). By leveraging machine\nlearning, this study aims to bridge the critical communication gap for the deaf\n& hard-of-hearing population in India, where technological solutions for ISL\nare less developed compared to other global sign languages. We propose a\nrobust, real-time ISL detection & translation system built upon a Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN). Our model is trained on a comprehensive ISL dataset &\ndemonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a classification accuracy of\n99.95%. This high precision underscores the model's capability to discern the\nnuanced visual features of different signs. The system's effectiveness is\nrigorously evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, F1\nscore, precision & recall, ensuring its reliability for real-world\napplications. For real-time implementation, the framework integrates MediaPipe\nfor precise hand tracking & motion detection, enabling seamless translation of\ndynamic gestures.
