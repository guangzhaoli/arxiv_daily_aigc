        "summary": "Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from\ndifferent modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical\ndiagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and\nmetabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information\nacross multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.\nTo address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,\nMMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these\nunique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network\n(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.\nTo extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale\nComplementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates\na hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and\nTransformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,\naddressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and\nenhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior\nresults in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments\nconfirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.\nAdditionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves\npromising performance.",

        "title": "Training-Free Text-Guided Color Editing with Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer",
        "summary": "Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved\nproblem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including\nalbedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical\nconsistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions.\nExisting training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks\nbut struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual\ninconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present\nColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention\nmechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By\ndisentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention\nmaps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color\nediting, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method\nmodifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated\nareas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate\nthat ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.\nFurthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1\nKontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended\nto video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,\nparticularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,\nour method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such\nas Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.",

        "summary": "Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained\nsignificant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether\ntraining-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining\nsubject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame\ninteraction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field\nmakes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the\nsubject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby\nhindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout\nconditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively\nfacilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens\nthe consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise\ncontrol over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.\nBuilding on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable\nStorytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout\nconditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout\nannotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1\nmillion 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300\nhours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a\nbenchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different\nmethods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework\nbased on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable\nStorytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we\nfind that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ntechniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic\ncorrelation, and aesthetic quality.",

While existing methods can generate visually compelling\nvideos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground\nsubject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,\nwe propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework\nthat explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and\naction from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these\nelements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system\nand perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is\nimplemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length\ncalibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and\norientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via\ntext-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion\ntransformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,\nconcatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion\n(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the\npossibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything\nanywhere.

This paper proposes an\nalternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is\nmore effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by\nproper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\\times{7}$, $9\\times{9}$,\n$11\\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator\nand designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective\nof receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing\nlarge-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining\nAGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of\nany scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,\nand ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and\nViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and\nlarge-scale models with comparable throughput.

To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a\nnovel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale\ndiscrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct\nencoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally\ninterpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them\ninto discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a\ngenerative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion\ncontrol, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and\nqualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless\ncomposition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or\nre-training.

        "summary": "Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention\nfor its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.\nHowever, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models\n(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and\nconditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on\nsuch conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,\nand challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity\npreservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face\nrecognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would\nbe preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to\nsynthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a\nsimple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature\nselection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,\nwe empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2\nlatent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while\npreserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for\nestimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity\npreservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters\nwe have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that\ncan be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,\nor systems for detection of synthetic images.

        "summary": "In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable\nprogress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering\nparadigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter\nallocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational\nefficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose\nvariations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and\nfailing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We\npropose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering\nthat ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build\na bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid\ntransformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between\nobservation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a\nparameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.\nA consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and\ndiscontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that\ndecomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body\nregions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along\nthree orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable\nappearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes\neffectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that\nour method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and\nocclusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and\nstructural continuity.",

As these\nmodels grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the\nneed to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance\n'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited\ntransferability across models due to their model-specific design and high\ncomputational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic\nadapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language\nmodels 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between\npre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,\nthis knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without\nthe need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few\nlayers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing\nthe process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,\noften surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.\nExperimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and\nefficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization\nabilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual\nrecognition tasks.",

        "summary": "There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile\ndevices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get\nempirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions\ninto our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We\nobserve that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly\nsuited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose\na decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building\nupon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)\nWe propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality.

        "title": "KFFocus: Highlighting Keyframes for Enhanced Video Understanding",
        "summary": "Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have\ndemonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite\nadvancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of\nlong video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression\nstrategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video\nframes) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame\ninto a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven\ntemporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the\nomission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To\ntackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently\ncompress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within\nvideo frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired\nby classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based\non their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to\nframes based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token\nredundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we\nintroduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal\nrelationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,\nthus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal\ndynamics.

Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the\nlack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body\nhuman captures.

The dataset includes\nHDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment\nmaps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of\nstate-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both\nthe dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling\ncomplex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions.

Learned image compression, a fundamental\ntask in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.\nHowever, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their\nrepresentation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression\nperformance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on\nscaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance\ntrends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as\nbaseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit\npower-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including\nmodel size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,\nenabling extrapolation to larger scale models.

        "summary": "Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual\nactivities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due\nto the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain\nshifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such\nscenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a\nthreshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic\nsettings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored\nfor VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our\napproach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative\ndata points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical\ninnovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables\nthe identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from\npseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the\nframework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,\nensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts\nacross various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that\nsimulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and\nrefinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that\nour method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world\nsimulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and\nsignificantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.",

This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less\nreliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can\neffectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.\nUnlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,\nAI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong\nsimilarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this\npaper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key\nchallenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation\nmodels, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core\nmodules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to\nunify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and\ncurriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more\ninformative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also\nfacilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.\nExtensive experiments on \\textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet\noutperforms SoTA approaches by \\textbf{6.3\\%}, highlighting its effectiveness\nin leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the\nincreasing realism of deepfakes.",

        "summary": "Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image\nsegmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined\nannotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize\nconsistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from\nunlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model\nand overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.\nFurthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from\ndifferent inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed\ninputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we\npropose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised\nmedical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two\ndistinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between\nthem, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we\npresent a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance\nfeature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two\nsubnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn\nshared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose\nan Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages\nsegmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to\ngenerate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed\nUC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality\nimages, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on.

These\nmethods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance\ncomponents, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving\nperfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be\nquite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In\nthis paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals\n(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our\ninvestigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also\ncauses enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately\nreducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose\na novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the\ndecomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage\ninter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity\nbetween illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we\nutilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and\nmitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit.

        "summary": "Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by\nenhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and\nensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves\nsuggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more\ncolors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled\nwith these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited\ndata availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color\nrecommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior\ndesigners for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a\nrobust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by\nsystematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective\nprompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette\ncompletion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and\naccompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette\ngeneration, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided\ntextual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based\npipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy\nand the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the\nfull palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color\ndiversity and similarity compared to current techniques.",

        "summary": "The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes\nprovides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While\ntraditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from\nbi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for\naccurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change\ninformation by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question\nAnswering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have\nbeen developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share\nsimilar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world\napplications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is\nrevisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new\nmulti-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate\ndomain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space\nmodel, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The\nTCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and\ngeo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract\ndomain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing\nin TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and\ngeo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between\nbi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against\nstate-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.\nThe code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at\nhttps://github.com/Elman295/TCSSM.",

MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful\nrepresentations from 3D point clouds.

Recent methods\nbased on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept\ncustomization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into\npre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for\nmulti-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature\nleakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)\ntoken-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial\nmisalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding\nconcept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA\n(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to\nfocus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training\nobjective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with\nits concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition\nby directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference\ntime. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient\nmulti-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each\nconcept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules.

In this work, we introduce\nDiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose\nestimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal\nreformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative\nframework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint\ngeneration, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global\nanatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific\nprompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via\ncross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints\nthroughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint\ndecoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving\nrobustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on\npublic animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization\ncapability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse\nspecies, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.",

        "title": "SHREC 2025: Retrieval of Optimal Objects for Multi-modal Enhanced Language and Spatial Assistance (ROOMELSA)",
        "summary": "Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled\nscenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief\ndescription. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring\nthe recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form\ndescription. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to\nevaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,\nROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and\naccurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In\naddition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,\nand more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object\nretrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked\nthe correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight\nCLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle\nvariations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in\noccasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly\nintegrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between\nscene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new\nbenchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.",

        "summary": "The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new\nchallenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled\nconditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor\nbehind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms\nlike YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,\nreplicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations\nand data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework\nthat emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating\ncompression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These\nparameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific\nartifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on\nFaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated\ndata closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,\ndetectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those\ntrained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical\nsolution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world\ndeployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of\ncompressed video content.",

Current T2I models allow users to specify object\ncolors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize\ncolor-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models\nstruggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire\nimage, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not\nexplicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to\nenhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate\nguidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the\neffectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation\nmethods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate\nthis exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and\nconduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results\ndemonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the\nmodel's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more\ncontrolled and refined colorization process.",

        "summary": "Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors\ndue to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging\nframeworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,\nrepairing the model effectively remains difficult.

To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable\nfailure attribution pipeline.

        "summary": "Although there have been notable advancements in video compression\ntechnologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue\naffecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of\nhigh-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the\nperceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution\nscreen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the\nbanding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that\nthe existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are\nlimited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding\ndynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed\nLIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different\ncompression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective\nopinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the\nvalue of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that\ndetect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.\nAmong these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)\nvideo quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of\nthe learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep\nneural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding\nprediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous\nstate-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,\nCBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video\ndebanding models.

        "summary": "Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between\npairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing\nbiomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as\nthyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration\nremains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently\nlow contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images\nseverely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.\nExisting methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical\ninterpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware\ndeformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages\nsynchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical\nprior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly\npredicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map\nutilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.\nThe stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense\ndeformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by\nHooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible\nregistration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying\nsolely on image similarity.

However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability\nunder strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under\nstricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.\nWhile ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle\nwith stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that\nenhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,\nimplicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is\nformed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,\ncapturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor\nfor knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed\nperiodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task\nconsistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation\nmechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and\npreserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a\nresult, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining\npreviously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and\nplasticity.

        "summary": "Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge\ntransfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of\nlarge vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge\ndistillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust\ngeneralization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,\nwhich are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting\nsuch large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in\nreal-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the\nentanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose\nAligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming\nto achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies\nentropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal\ndata (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,\nconducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.\nThis enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while\nrequiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can\nserve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language\ndistillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that\nintegrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared\nmanifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate\nthat AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in\nsuperior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.",

        "summary": "Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its\ncapability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.\nHowever, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the\ncategories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they\nexperience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously\nlearn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these\nchallenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model\nthat overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both\nframe-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting\nat the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal\ngradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode\ntask-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual\nframe by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old\nclasses. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a\ntask-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first\nembeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt\nfeatures, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the\nframe prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our\nHVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is\navailable at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.",

        "summary": "Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic\ndevice, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other\ninstability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved\nimpressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on\nreal-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and\ntesting data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for\nhandheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,\nto train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and\ntake them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to\nimprove the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring\n(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a\nSelf-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize\nthe model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.\nMoreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for\nhandheld video deblurring.

Although DETR-based methods have\nrecently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still\nsuffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit\nsemantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this\nchallenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework\nthat incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through\ntransformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is\n\\textbf{ACTOR} (\\textbf{A}ction-aware \\textbf{C}ross-modal\n\\textbf{T}ransf\\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly\nattends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant\nfeatures. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages\nlanguage-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce\nsemantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level\nquery quality, we introduce a \\textbf{P}erceptual \\textbf{D}istilled\n\\textbf{Q}uery \\textbf{D}ecoder (\\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category\nawareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This\ndual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more\ninterpretable and effective queries for HOI detection.

        "summary": "Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face\nrestoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR\nsettings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the\ndiscrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)\nsynthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on\nimages with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely\ndegraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a\nnaive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to\nsimulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this\nwork, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to\nresolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates\nBFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic\nand faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes\nreal-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world\ndegradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our\nmodel 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of\nauthenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in\nmodeling the real-world degradations.",

By crafting universal steering images that induce target\nactivation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving\nmodalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual\ninstructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment\ntasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image\nmatches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts\nwhile dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%\nshifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike\nsystem prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control\nwhile maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond\neliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a\ncritical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated\nbehavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based\ndefenses.

Through a comprehensive investigation of manga\nnarrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models\nexcel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal\ncausality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story\ncomprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines\nfine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and\nretrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these\nlimitations.\n  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual\nelements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)\ncomprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct\ninference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity\nanalysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint\nrepresentations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters\nwith 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form\nnarrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative\nstorytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our\nfindings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,\nstruggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and\ncausal inference across extended sequences.

We capture this with a\nscene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of \"object layers,\"\neach containing an isolated and amodally-completed object.

We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images\nof multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to\nphotographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In\ncontrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs\nmultiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number\nof objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric\nrepresentation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either\nanother person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR)\nenvironment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and\nretargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same\nframework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions\nwhen exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig\nused by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically\nmeaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order\nto better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit\ndifferentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially\nnon-differentiable) black box.",

        "summary": "Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark\nembedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective\nfor copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face\nlimitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for\ngeneralizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),\n2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)\nbroad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage\noptimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three\ncriteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to\nestablish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency\nbetween watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance\nacross watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs\nincluding watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be\nwell represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in\nwatermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark\nrepresentation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating\nwatermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly\npenalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to\nidentical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable\nlatent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In\nparticular, it achieves 7.6\\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than\nexisting methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images\nprocessed in 8s).",

        "title": "Hybrid Long and Short Range Flows for Point Cloud Filtering",
        "summary": "Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts\nthat necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer\nfrom point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose\nHybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both\nshort-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is\nwell established that short range scores, given by $\\nabla_{x}\\log p(x_t)$, may\nprovide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying\nclean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant\ndisplacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the\ncorresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as\nintermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our\nintuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide\nthe short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,\nscore models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.\nSpecifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,\neach consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for\nshort-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,\nguided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point\ndistributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss\nfunction to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an\nend-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement\nbased methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic\ngraph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results\nwhile enabling faster inference speed.",

While previous work has\nproposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and\noptical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks\nand hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic\nand hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and\nsegmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design\nbefore training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified\nconstraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce\nNeural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with\nelectronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After\nfabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate\nfor implementation errors.

However, their reasoning processes\nremain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and\ntrustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,\nand medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic\nforgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.\nIn this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)\nframework for dynamic inference-time reasoning.

By integrating multi-objective rule-based\nrewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic\nforgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency.

        "summary": "Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its\nreal-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered\nby shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional\napproaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information\nfrom preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by\ncomplex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need\nfor recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative\nby reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large\nset of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically\noffline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel\nintegrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape\ncompletion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously\nacquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from\nultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based\nshape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time\nvisualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable\nnavigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,\nreproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our\napproach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy\nand evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.\nAdditionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a\nvolunteer scan.",

While recent work has\nadvanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have\nfocused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging\nanalysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized\npostsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,\nsegmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor\ncore, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.\nAdditionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for\ncontrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The\nmodels were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0\nguidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to\n7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,\nvoxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS\nchallenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice\nscores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,\ncontrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.\nClassification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence\nclassification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in\nthis study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,\nand standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing\npostoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making.

        "summary": "The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social\nintelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's\nability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective\nhuman-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass\nhuman experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,\nparticularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely\nunexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs\nusing the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial\ncounterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.\nResults show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately\nidentifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing\nperformance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we\naggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,\nhuman groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM\npredictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative\napproach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions\nachieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results\nsuggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual\nlevel, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of\nhuman-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional\nAI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of\nemotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.",

        "summary": "This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality\nAssessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.\nWithin this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness\n(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one\npermissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.\nWhen its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR\nscore serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman\ncorrelations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and\n-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a\ntwo-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various\ndistortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR\nconfigurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over\n97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated\nregression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify\nthe degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human\nscores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square\nError (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the\ndataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This\nestablishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification\nand subsequent quantification of image degradation.",

        "summary": "Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level\nscene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands\nefficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference\nthrough lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment\nbetween class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel\nclassification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm\nresults in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel\nfeatures should not vary for the same category in different images. To address\nthis dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that\nexplicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class\nrepresentations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we\nconstruct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the\noffset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional\narchitectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including\nADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent\nimprovements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,\nour proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and\nMask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M\nadditional parameters required.",

        "summary": "Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of\nintraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation\nnetworks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,\noverlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous\n(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often\nsuffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,\nexperts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying\nconfidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,\nambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure\nsub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold\nfrom the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert\nannotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into\nlow-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted\nloss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive\nconfidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold\nof ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors\nin boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary\nExpected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens\nstructure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that\nour ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across\ndifferent deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM).

This substantial divergence in\nmethodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the\nlack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that\nnaturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding\ndivide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports\nboth source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from\nall prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct\nconsequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted\nadaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic\nprobabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring\nhow humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each\nimage can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and\na spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This\ndisentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful\nprediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging\ncardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely\napproaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely\nobserved in prior works.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM\nwith seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.\nConsequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,\nachieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We\nfurther present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which\nleverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the\nheatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,\noptimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we\npropose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt\nembeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy\nof dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on\nan echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the\nsuperiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and\nindicator measurements.

This paper introduces a novel\napproach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)\nimages by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for\nhyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and\nrobustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate\nand batch size.

        "title": "Preprocessing Algorithm Leveraging Geometric Modeling for Scale Correction in Hyperspectral Images for Improved Unmixing Performance",
        "summary": "Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of\nhyperspectral unmixing algorithms. While many methods address complex spectral\nvariability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by\nfactors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major\nchallenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate\nmodel fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that\ncorrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and\ncompensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm\nprovides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively\non modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present\na rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive\nexperimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's\nimpact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing\nalgorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed\npreprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms,\nincluding those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with\nerror reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale\ncorrection acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by\nexisting methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight\nits potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines.\nThe implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.",

        "summary": "Sharpening is a widely adopted technique to improve video quality, which can\neffectively emphasize textures and alleviate blurring. However, increasing the\nsharpening level comes with a higher video bitrate, resulting in degraded\nQuality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, the video quality does not necessarily\nimprove with increasing sharpening levels, leading to issues such as\nover-sharpening. Clearly, it is essential to figure out how to boost video\nquality with a proper sharpening level while also controlling bandwidth costs\neffectively. This paper thus proposes a novel Frequency-assisted Sharpening\nlevel Prediction model (FreqSP). We first label each video with the sharpening\nlevel correlating to the optimal bitrate and quality tradeoff as ground truth.\nThen taking uncompressed source videos as inputs, the proposed FreqSP leverages\nintricate CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal\nsharpening level.

        "summary": "Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th\ncentury, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal\nstructures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,\ntranscribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,\nresulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition\n(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by\nleveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their\ncounterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We\nintroduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between\nself-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore\nEuclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation\nmetrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character\nerror rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when\nusing Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach\nimproves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading\nto more effective OCR performance for historical documents.",
