        "summary": "Most visual generative models compress images into a latent space before applying diffusion or autoregressive modelling. Yet, existing approaches such as VAEs and foundation model aligned encoders implicitly constrain the latent space without explicitly shaping its distribution, making it unclear which types of distributions are optimal for modeling. We introduce \\textbf{Distribution-Matching VAE} (\\textbf{DMVAE}), which explicitly aligns the encoder's latent distribution with an arbitrary reference distribution via a distribution matching constraint. This generalizes beyond the Gaussian prior of conventional VAEs, enabling alignment with distributions derived from self-supervised features, diffusion noise, or other prior distributions. With DMVAE, we can systematically investigate which latent distributions are more conducive to modeling, and we find that SSL-derived distributions provide an excellent balance between reconstruction fidelity and modeling efficiency, reaching gFID equals 3.2 on ImageNet with only 64 training epochs. Our results suggest that choosing a suitable latent distribution structure (achieved via distribution-level alignment), rather than relying on fixed priors, is key to bridging the gap between easy-to-model latents and high-fidelity image synthesis.

        "summary": "Monitoring critically endangered western lowland gorillas is currently hampered by the immense manual effort required to re-identify individuals from vast archives of camera trap footage. The primary obstacle to automating this process has been the lack of large-scale, \"in-the-wild\" video datasets suitable for training robust deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark with three novel datasets: Gorilla-SPAC-Wild, the largest video dataset for wild primate re-identification to date; Gorilla-Berlin-Zoo, for assessing cross-domain re-identification generalization; and Gorilla-SPAC-MoT, for evaluating multi-object tracking in camera trap footage. Building on these datasets, we present GorillaWatch, an end-to-end pipeline integrating detection, tracking, and re-identification. To exploit temporal information, we introduce a multi-frame self-supervised pretraining strategy that leverages consistency in tracklets to learn domain-specific features without manual labels. To ensure scientific validity, a differentiable adaptation of AttnLRP verifies that our model relies on discriminative biometric traits rather than background correlations. Extensive benchmarking subsequently demonstrates that aggregating features from large-scale image backbones outperforms specialized video architectures. Finally, we address unsupervised population counting by integrating spatiotemporal constraints into standard clustering to mitigate over-segmentation. We publicly release all code and datasets to facilitate scalable, non-invasive monitoring of endangered species",

        "summary": "Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID) aims to match individuals across visible and infrared cameras without relying on any annotation. Given the significant gap across visible and infrared modality, estimating reliable cross-modality association becomes a major challenge in USVI-ReID. Existing methods usually adopt optimal transport to associate the intra-modality clusters, which is prone to propagating the local cluster errors, and also overlooks global instance-level relations. By mining and attending to the visible-infrared modality bias, this paper focuses on addressing cross-modality learning from two aspects: bias-mitigated global association and modality-invariant representation learning. Motivated by the camera-aware distance rectification in single-modality re-ID, we propose modality-aware Jaccard distance to mitigate the distance bias caused by modality discrepancy, so that more reliable cross-modality associations can be estimated through global clustering. To further improve cross-modality representation learning, a `split-and-contrast' strategy is designed to obtain modality-specific global prototypes. By explicitly aligning these prototypes under global association guidance, modality-invariant yet ID-discriminative representation learning can be achieved. While conceptually simple, our method obtains state-of-the-art performance on benchmark VI-ReID datasets and outperforms existing methods by a significant margin, validating its effectiveness.",

        "summary": "Clinical ultrasound acquisition is highly operator-dependent, where rapid probe motion and brightness fluctuations often lead to reconstruction errors that reduce trust and clinical utility. We present UltrasODM, a dual-stream framework that assists sonographers during acquisition through calibrated per-frame uncertainty, saliency-based diagnostics, and actionable prompts. UltrasODM integrates (i) a contrastive ranking module that groups frames by motion similarity, (ii) an optical-flow stream fused with Dual-Mamba temporal modules for robust 6-DoF pose estimation, and (iii) a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) layer combining Bayesian uncertainty, clinician-calibrated thresholds, and saliency maps highlighting regions of low confidence. When uncertainty exceeds the threshold, the system issues unobtrusive alerts suggesting corrective actions such as re-scanning highlighted regions or slowing the sweep. Evaluated on a clinical freehand ultrasound dataset, UltrasODM reduces drift by 15.2%, distance error by 12.1%, and Hausdorff distance by 10.1% relative to UltrasOM, while producing per-frame uncertainty and saliency outputs. By emphasizing transparency and clinician feedback, UltrasODM improves reconstruction reliability and supports safer, more trustworthy clinical workflows.

        "title": "Unison: A Fully Automatic, Task-Universal, and Low-Cost Framework for Unified Understanding and Generation",
        "summary": "Unified understanding and generation is a highly appealing research direction in multimodal learning. There exist two approaches: one trains a transformer via an auto-regressive paradigm, and the other adopts a two-stage scheme connecting pre-trained understanding and generative models for alignment fine-tuning. The former demands massive data and computing resources unaffordable for ordinary researchers. Though the latter requires a lower training cost, existing works often suffer from limited task coverage or poor generation quality. Both approaches lack the ability to parse input meta-information (such as task type, image resolution, video duration, etc.) and require manual parameter configuration that is tedious and non-intelligent. In this paper, we propose Unison which adopts the two-stage scheme while preserving the capabilities of the pre-trained models well. With an extremely low training cost, we cover a variety of multimodal understanding tasks, including text, image, and video understanding, as well as diverse generation tasks, such as text-to-visual content generation, editing, controllable generation, and IP-based reference generation. We also equip our model with the ability to automatically parse user intentions, determine the target task type, and accurately extract the meta-information required for the corresponding task. This enables full automation of various multimodal tasks without human intervention. Experiments demonstrate that, under a low-cost setting of only 500k training samples and 50 GPU hours, our model can accurately and automatically identify tasks and extract relevant parameters, and achieve superior performance across a variety of understanding and generation tasks.",

        "summary": "Generative diffusion models for end-to-end autonomous driving often suffer from mode collapse, tending to generate conservative and homogeneous behaviors. While DiffusionDrive employs predefined anchors representing different driving intentions to partition the action space and generate diverse trajectories, its reliance on imitation learning lacks sufficient constraints, resulting in a dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality. In this work, we propose DiffusionDriveV2, which leverages reinforcement learning to both constrain low-quality modes and explore for superior trajectories. This significantly enhances the overall output quality while preserving the inherent multimodality of its core Gaussian Mixture Model. First, we use scale-adaptive multiplicative noise, ideal for trajectory planning, to promote broad exploration. Second, we employ intra-anchor GRPO to manage advantage estimation among samples generated from a single anchor, and inter-anchor truncated GRPO to incorporate a global perspective across different anchors, preventing improper advantage comparisons between distinct intentions (e.g., turning vs. going straight), which can lead to further mode collapse. DiffusionDriveV2 achieves 91.2 PDMS on the NAVSIM v1 dataset and 85.5 EPDMS on the NAVSIM v2 dataset in closed-loop evaluation with an aligned ResNet-34 backbone, setting a new record. Further experiments validate that our approach resolves the dilemma between diversity and consistent high quality for truncated diffusion models, achieving the best trade-off.

To address this, we propose SAVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Driven Visual Information Enhancement), a framework that mitigates hallucination by steering the model along Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) latent features. A binary object-presence question-answering probe identifies the SAE features most indicative of the model's visual information processing, referred to as visual understanding features. Steering the model along these identified features reinforces grounded visual understanding and effectively reduces hallucination. With its simple design, SAVE outperforms state-of-the-art training-free methods on standard benchmarks, achieving a 10\\%p improvement in CHAIR\\_S and consistent gains on POPE and MMHal-Bench. Extensive evaluations across multiple models and layers confirm the robustness and generalizability of our approach. Further analysis reveals that steering along visual understanding features suppresses the generation of uncertain object tokens and increases attention to image tokens, mitigating hallucination.

        "title": "Improving action classification with brain-inspired deep networks",
        "summary": "Action recognition is also key for applications ranging from robotics to healthcare monitoring. Action information can be extracted from the body pose and movements, as well as from the background scene. However, the extent to which deep neural networks (DNNs) make use of information about the body and information about the background remains unclear. Since these two sources of information may be correlated within a training dataset, DNNs might learn to rely predominantly on one of them, without taking full advantage of the other. Unlike DNNs, humans have domain-specific brain regions selective for perceiving bodies, and regions selective for perceiving scenes. The present work tests whether humans are thus more effective at extracting information from both body and background, and whether building brain-inspired deep network architectures with separate domain-specific streams for body and scene perception endows them with more human-like performance. We first demonstrate that DNNs trained using the HAA500 dataset perform almost as accurately on versions of the stimuli that show both body and background and on versions of the stimuli from which the body was removed, but are at chance-level for versions of the stimuli from which the background was removed. Conversely, human participants (N=28) can recognize the same set of actions accurately with all three versions of the stimuli, and perform significantly better on stimuli that show only the body than on stimuli that show only the background. Finally, we implement and test a novel architecture patterned after domain specificity in the brain with separate streams to process body and background information. We show that 1) this architecture improves action recognition performance, and 2) its accuracy across different versions of the stimuli follows a pattern that matches more closely the pattern of accuracy observed in human participants.",

        "summary": "Generating high-fidelity upper-body 3D avatars from one-shot input image remains a significant challenge. Current 3D avatar generation methods, which rely on large reconstruction models, are fast and capable of producing stable body structures, but they often suffer from artifacts such as blurry textures and stiff, unnatural motion. In contrast, generative video models show promising performance by synthesizing photorealistic and dynamic results, but they frequently struggle with unstable behavior, including body structural errors and identity drift. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework employs a 3D reconstruction model to provide robust structural and appearance priors, which in turn guides a real-time autoregressive video diffusion model for rendering. This process enables the model to synthesize high-frequency, photorealistic details and fluid dynamics in real time, effectively reducing texture blur and motion stiffness while preventing the structural inconsistencies common in video generation methods. By uniting the geometric stability of 3D reconstruction with the generative capabilities of video models, our method produces high-fidelity digital avatars with realistic appearance and dynamic, temporally coherent motion. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces artifacts and achieves substantial improvements in visual quality over leading methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for real-time applications such as gaming and virtual reality.

Our Gabor-enhanced segmentation model leverages orientation-aware features with 72 directional kernels to accurately identify and segment cage structures that severely impair the performance of existing methods.

Training or even finetuning such models demands vast datasets and computational resources, which are often scarce and costly. Adaptation methods provide a computationally efficient solution to address these limitations by allowing such models to be finetuned on small amounts of data and computing power. This is achieved by appending new trainable modules to frozen backbones with only a fraction of the trainable parameters and fitting only these modules on novel tasks. Recently, the VeRA adapter was shown to excel in parameter-efficient adaptations by utilizing a pair of frozen random low-rank matrices shared across all layers. In this paper, we propose PVeRA, a probabilistic version of the VeRA adapter, which modifies the low-rank matrices of VeRA in a probabilistic manner. This modification naturally allows handling inherent ambiguities in the input and allows for different sampling configurations during training and testing. A comprehensive evaluation was performed on the VTAB-1k benchmark and seven adapters, with PVeRA outperforming VeRA and other adapters.

        "title": "Guiding What Not to Generate: Automated Negative Prompting for Text-Image Alignment",
        "summary": "Despite substantial progress in text-to-image generation, achieving precise text-image alignment remains challenging, particularly for prompts with rich compositional structure or imaginative elements. To address this, we introduce Negative Prompting for Image Correction (NPC), an automated pipeline that improves alignment by identifying and applying negative prompts that suppress unintended content. We begin by analyzing cross-attention patterns to explain why both targeted negatives-those directly tied to the prompt's alignment error-and untargeted negatives-tokens unrelated to the prompt but present in the generated image-can enhance alignment. To discover useful negatives, NPC generates candidate prompts using a verifier-captioner-proposer framework and ranks them with a salient text-space score, enabling effective selection without requiring additional image synthesis. On GenEval++ and Imagine-Bench, NPC outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.571 vs. 0.371 on GenEval++ and the best overall performance on Imagine-Bench. By guiding what not to generate, NPC provides a principled, fully automated route to stronger text-image alignment in diffusion models. Code is released at https://github.com/wiarae/NPC.",

        "summary": "Understanding articulated objects is a fundamental challenge in robotics and digital twin creation. To effectively model such objects, it is essential to recover both part segmentation and the underlying joint parameters. Despite the importance of this task, previous work has largely focused on setups like multi-view systems, object scanning, or static cameras. In this paper, we present the first data-driven approach that jointly predicts part segmentation and joint parameters from monocular video captured with a freely moving camera. Trained solely on synthetic data, our method demonstrates strong generalization to real-world objects, offering a scalable and practical solution for articulated object understanding. Our approach operates directly on casually recorded video, making it suitable for real-time applications in dynamic environments. Project webpage: https://aartykov.github.io/sim2art/",

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in vision-language understanding tasks. While these models often produce linguistically coherent output, they often suffer from hallucinations, generating descriptions that are factually inconsistent with the visual content, potentially leading to adverse consequences. Therefore, the assessment of hallucinations in MLLM has become increasingly crucial in the model development process. Contemporary methodologies predominantly depend on external LLM evaluators, which are themselves susceptible to hallucinations and may present challenges in terms of domain adaptation. In this study, we propose the hypothesis that hallucination manifests as measurable irregularities within the internal layer dynamics of MLLMs, not merely due to distributional shifts but also in the context of layer-wise analysis of specific assumptions. By incorporating such modifications, \\textsc{\\textsc{HalluShift++}} broadens the efficacy of hallucination detection from text-based large language models (LLMs) to encompass multimodal scenarios.

        "title": "DIST-CLIP: Arbitrary Metadata and Image Guided MRI Harmonization via Disentangled Anatomy-Contrast Representations",
        "summary": "Deep learning holds immense promise for transforming medical image analysis, yet its clinical generalization remains profoundly limited. A major barrier is data heterogeneity. This is particularly true in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, where scanner hardware differences, diverse acquisition protocols, and varying sequence parameters introduce substantial domain shifts that obscure underlying biological signals. Data harmonization methods aim to reduce these instrumental and acquisition variability, but existing approaches remain insufficient. When applied to imaging data, image-based harmonization approaches are often restricted by the need for target images, while existing text-guided methods rely on simplistic labels that fail to capture complex acquisition details or are typically restricted to datasets with limited variability, failing to capture the heterogeneity of real-world clinical environments. To address these limitations, we propose DIST-CLIP (Disentangled Style Transfer with CLIP Guidance), a unified framework for MRI harmonization that flexibly uses either target images or DICOM metadata for guidance. Our framework explicitly disentangles anatomical content from image contrast, with the contrast representations being extracted using pre-trained CLIP encoders. These contrast embeddings are then integrated into the anatomical content via a novel Adaptive Style Transfer module. We trained and evaluated DIST-CLIP on diverse real-world clinical datasets, and showed significant improvements in performance when compared against state-of-the-art methods in both style translation fidelity and anatomical preservation, offering a flexible solution for style transfer and standardizing MRI data. Our code and weights will be made publicly available upon publication.",

        "summary": "We address the challenge of predicting human visual attention during real-world navigation by measuring and modeling egocentric pedestrian eye gaze in an outdoor campus setting. We introduce the EgoCampus dataset, which spans 25 unique outdoor paths over 6 km across a university campus with recordings from more than 80 distinct human pedestrians, resulting in a diverse set of gaze-annotated videos. The system used for collection, Meta's Project Aria glasses, integrates eye tracking, front-facing RGB cameras, inertial sensors, and GPS to provide rich data from the human perspective. Unlike many prior egocentric datasets that focus on indoor tasks or exclude eye gaze information, our work emphasizes visual attention while subjects walk in outdoor campus paths. Using this data, we develop EgoCampusNet, a novel method to predict eye gaze of navigating pedestrians as they move through outdoor environments. Our contributions provide both a new resource for studying real-world attention and a resource for future work in gaze prediction models for navigation.

        "summary": "Realistic and diverse multi-agent driving scenes are crucial for evaluating autonomous vehicles, but safety-critical events which are essential for this task are rare and underrepresented in driving datasets. Data-driven scene generation offers a low-cost alternative by synthesizing complex traffic behaviors from existing driving logs. However, existing models often lack controllability or yield samples that violate physical or social constraints, limiting their usability. We present OMEGA, an optimization-guided, training-free framework that enforces structural consistency and interaction awareness during diffusion-based sampling from a scene generation model. OMEGA re-anchors each reverse diffusion step via constrained optimization, steering the generation towards physically plausible and behaviorally coherent trajectories. Building on this framework, we formulate ego-attacker interactions as a game-theoretic optimization in the distribution space, approximating Nash equilibria to generate realistic, safety-critical adversarial scenarios. Experiments on nuPlan and Waymo show that OMEGA improves generation realism, consistency, and controllability, increasing the ratio of physically and behaviorally valid scenes from 32.35% to 72.27% for free exploration capabilities, and from 11% to 80% for controllability-focused generation. Our approach can also generate $5\\times$ more near-collision frames with a time-to-collision under three seconds while maintaining the overall scene realism.",

This paper presents an innovative AI-powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system designed to overcome these limitations by automating underwater object detection, analysis, and reporting. The system integrates YOLOv12 Nano for real-time object detection, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (ResNet50) for feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and K-Means++ clustering for grouping marine objects based on visual characteristics. Furthermore, a Large Language Model (LLM) (GPT-4o Mini) is employed to generate structured reports and summaries of underwater findings, enhancing data interpretation. The system was trained and evaluated on a combined dataset of over 55,000 images from the DeepFish and OzFish datasets, capturing diverse Australian marine environments. Experimental results demonstrate the system's capability to detect marine objects with a mAP@0.5 of 0.512, a precision of 0.535, and a recall of 0.438. The integration of PCA effectively reduced feature dimensionality while preserving 98% variance, facilitating K-Means clustering which successfully grouped detected objects based on visual similarities. The LLM integration proved effective in generating insightful summaries of detections and clusters, supported by location data. This integrated approach significantly reduces the risks associated with human diving, increases mission efficiency, and enhances the speed and depth of underwater data analysis, paving the way for more effective scientific research and discovery in challenging marine environments.",

While most prior work has focused on selecting informative images for classification tasks, we investigate the more challenging setting of dense prediction, where annotations are more costly and time-intensive, especially in medical imaging. Region-level annotation has been shown to be more efficient than image-level annotation for these tasks. However, existing methods for representative annotation region selection suffer from high computational and memory costs, irrelevant region choices, and heavy reliance on uncertainty sampling. We propose decomposition sampling (DECOMP), a new active learning sampling strategy that addresses these limitations. It enhances annotation diversity by decomposing images into class-specific components using pseudo-labels and sampling regions from each class. Class-wise predictive confidence further guides the sampling process, ensuring that difficult classes receive additional annotations. Across ROI classification, 2-D segmentation, and 3-D segmentation, DECOMP consistently surpasses baseline methods by better sampling minority-class regions and boosting performance on these challenging classes.

        "summary": "Online, real-time, and fine-grained 3D segmentation constitutes a fundamental capability for embodied intelligent agents to perceive and comprehend their operational environments. Recent advancements employ predefined object queries to aggregate semantic information from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) outputs that are lifted into 3D point clouds, facilitating spatial information propagation through inter-query interactions. Nevertheless, perception is an inherently dynamic process, rendering temporal understanding a critical yet overlooked dimension within these prevailing query-based pipelines. Therefore, to further unlock the temporal environmental perception capabilities of embodied agents, our work reconceptualizes online 3D segmentation as an instance tracking problem (AutoSeg3D). Our core strategy involves utilizing object queries for temporal information propagation, where long-term instance association promotes the coherence of features and object identities, while short-term instance update enriches instant observations. Given that viewpoint variations in embodied robotics often lead to partial object visibility across frames, this mechanism aids the model in developing a holistic object understanding beyond incomplete instantaneous views. Furthermore, we introduce spatial consistency learning to mitigate the fragmentation problem inherent in VFMs, yielding more comprehensive instance information for enhancing the efficacy of both long-term and short-term temporal learning. The temporal information exchange and consistency learning facilitated by these sparse object queries not only enhance spatial comprehension but also circumvent the computational burden associated with dense temporal point cloud interactions. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing ESAM by 2.8 AP on ScanNet200 and delivering consistent gains on ScanNet, SceneNN, and 3RScan datasets.",

In this empirical evaluation, we assess the performance of SAM 3 in robot-assisted surgery, benchmarking its zero-shot segmentation with point and bounding box prompts and exploring its effectiveness in dynamic video tracking, alongside its newly introduced language prompt segmentation. While language prompts show potential, their performance in the surgical domain is currently suboptimal, highlighting the need for further domain-specific training. Additionally, we investigate SAM 3's 3D reconstruction abilities, demonstrating its capacity to process surgical scene data and reconstruct 3D anatomical structures from 2D images. Through comprehensive testing on the MICCAI EndoVis 2017 and EndoVis 2018 benchmarks, SAM 3 shows clear improvements over SAM and SAM 2 in both image and video segmentation under spatial prompts, while zero-shot evaluations on SCARED, StereoMIS, and EndoNeRF indicate strong monocular depth estimation and realistic 3D instrument reconstruction, yet also reveal remaining limitations in complex, highly dynamic surgical scenes.",

        "summary": "We introduce LongCat-Image, a pioneering open-source and bilingual (Chinese-English) foundation model for image generation, designed to address core challenges in multilingual text rendering, photorealism, deployment efficiency, and developer accessibility prevalent in current leading models. 1) We achieve this through rigorous data curation strategies across the pre-training, mid-training, and SFT stages, complemented by the coordinated use of curated reward models during the RL phase. This strategy establishes the model as a new state-of-the-art (SOTA), delivering superior text-rendering capabilities and remarkable photorealism, and significantly enhancing aesthetic quality. 2) Notably, it sets a new industry standard for Chinese character rendering. By supporting even complex and rare characters, it outperforms both major open-source and commercial solutions in coverage, while also achieving superior accuracy. 3) The model achieves remarkable efficiency through its compact design. With a core diffusion model of only 6B parameters, it is significantly smaller than the nearly 20B or larger Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures common in the field. This ensures minimal VRAM usage and rapid inference, significantly reducing deployment costs. Beyond generation, LongCat-Image also excels in image editing, achieving SOTA results on standard benchmarks with superior editing consistency compared to other open-source works. 4) To fully empower the community, we have established the most comprehensive open-source ecosystem to date. We are releasing not only multiple model versions for text-to-image and image editing, including checkpoints after mid-training and post-training stages, but also the entire toolchain of training procedure. We believe that the openness of LongCat-Image will provide robust support for developers and researchers, pushing the frontiers of visual content creation.",

        "title": "All You Need Are Random Visual Tokens? Demystifying Token Pruning in VLLMs",
        "summary": "Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) incur high computational costs due to their reliance on hundreds of visual tokens to represent images. While token pruning offers a promising solution for accelerating inference, this paper, however, identifies a key observation: in deeper layers (e.g., beyond the 20th), existing training-free pruning methods perform no better than random pruning. We hypothesize that this degradation is caused by \"vanishing token information\", where visual tokens progressively lose their salience with increasing network depth. To validate this hypothesis, we quantify a token's information content by measuring the change in the model output probabilities upon its removal. Using this proposed metric, our analysis of the information of visual tokens across layers reveals three key findings: (1) As layers deepen, the information of visual tokens gradually becomes uniform and eventually vanishes at an intermediate layer, which we term as \"information horizon\", beyond which the visual tokens become redundant; (2) The position of this horizon is not static; it extends deeper for visually intensive tasks, such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR), compared to more general tasks like Visual Question Answering (VQA); (3) This horizon is also strongly correlated with model capacity, as stronger VLLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL) employ deeper visual tokens than weaker models (e.g., LLaVA-1.5). Based on our findings, we show that simple random pruning in deep layers efficiently balances performance and efficiency. Moreover, integrating random pruning consistently enhances existing methods. Using DivPrune with random pruning achieves state-of-the-art results, maintaining 96.9% of Qwen-2.5-VL-7B performance while pruning 50% of visual tokens.

        "summary": "Accurate segmentation of spinal structures in X-ray images is a prerequisite for quantitative scoliosis assessment, including Cobb angle measurement, vertebral translation estimation and curvature classification. In routine practice, clinicians acquire coronal, left-bending and right-bending radiographs to jointly evaluate deformity severity and spinal flexibility. However, the segmentation step remains heavily manual, time-consuming and non-reproducible, particularly in low-contrast images and in the presence of rib shadows or overlapping tissues. To address these limitations, this paper proposes R2MF-Net, a recurrent residual multi-path encoder--decoder network tailored for automatic segmentation of multi-directional spine X-ray images. The overall design consists of a coarse segmentation network and a fine segmentation network connected in cascade. Both stages adopt an improved Inception-style multi-branch feature extractor, while a recurrent residual jump connection (R2-Jump) module is inserted into skip paths to gradually align encoder and decoder semantics. A multi-scale cross-stage skip (MC-Skip) mechanism allows the fine network to reuse hierarchical representations from multiple decoder levels of the coarse network, thereby strengthening the stability of segmentation across imaging directions and contrast conditions. Furthermore, a lightweight spatial-channel squeeze-and-excitation block (SCSE-Lite) is employed at the bottleneck to emphasize spine-related activations and suppress irrelevant structures and background noise. We evaluate R2MF-Net on a clinical multi-view radiograph dataset comprising 228 sets of coronal, left-bending and right-bending spine X-ray images with expert annotations.",

        "summary": "Accurate three-dimensional delineation of liver tumors on contrast-enhanced CT is a prerequisite for treatment planning, navigation and response assessment, yet manual contouring is slow, observer-dependent and difficult to standardise across centres. Automatic segmentation is complicated by low lesion-parenchyma contrast, blurred or incomplete boundaries, heterogeneous enhancement patterns, and confounding structures such as vessels and adjacent organs. We propose a hybrid framework that couples an attention-enhanced cascaded U-Net with handcrafted radiomics and voxel-wise 3D CNN refinement for joint liver and liver-tumor segmentation. First, a 2.5D two-stage network with a densely connected encoder, sub-pixel convolution decoders and multi-scale attention gates produces initial liver and tumor probability maps from short stacks of axial slices. Inter-slice temporal consistency is then enforced by a simple three-slice refinement rule along the cranio-caudal direction, which restores thin and tiny lesions while suppressing isolated noise. Next, 728 radiomic descriptors spanning intensity, texture, shape, boundary and wavelet feature groups are extracted from candidate lesions and reduced to 20 stable, highly informative features via multi-strategy feature selection; a random forest classifier uses these features to reject false-positive regions. Finally, a compact 3D patch-based CNN derived from AlexNet operates in a narrow band around the tumor boundary to perform voxel-level relabelling and contour smoothing.",

        "title": "Dual-Stream Cross-Modal Representation Learning via Residual Semantic Decorrelation",
        "summary": "Cross-modal learning has become a fundamental paradigm for integrating heterogeneous information sources such as images, text, and structured attributes. However, multimodal representations often suffer from modality dominance, redundant information coupling, and spurious cross-modal correlations, leading to suboptimal generalization and limited interpretability. In particular, high-variance modalities tend to overshadow weaker but semantically important signals, while naïve fusion strategies entangle modality-shared and modality-specific factors in an uncontrolled manner. This makes it difficult to understand which modality actually drives a prediction and to maintain robustness when some modalities are noisy or missing. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Residual Semantic Decorrelation Network (DSRSD-Net), a simple yet effective framework that disentangles modality-specific and modality-shared information through residual decomposition and explicit semantic decorrelation constraints. DSRSD-Net introduces: (1) a dual-stream representation learning module that separates intra-modal (private) and inter-modal (shared) latent factors via residual projection; (2) a residual semantic alignment head that maps shared factors from different modalities into a common space using a combination of contrastive and regression-style objectives; and (3) a decorrelation and orthogonality loss that regularizes the covariance structure of the shared space while enforcing orthogonality between shared and private streams, thereby suppressing cross-modal redundancy and preventing feature collapse. Experimental results on two large-scale educational benchmarks demonstrate that DSRSD-Net consistently improves next-step prediction and final outcome prediction over strong single-modality, early-fusion, late-fusion, and co-attention baselines.",

We propose a training-free self-correction framework enabling VLMs to iteratively refine responses through uncertainty-guided visual re-attention. Our method combines multidimensional uncertainty quantification (token entropy, attention dispersion, semantic consistency, claim confidence) with attention-guided cropping of under-explored regions. Operating entirely with frozen, pretrained VLMs, our framework requires no gradient updates. We validate our approach on the POPE and MMHAL BENCH benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23] architecture. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces hallucination rates by 9.8 percentage points compared to the baseline, while improving object existence accuracy by 4.7 points on adversarial splits. Furthermore, qualitative analysis confirms that uncertainty-guided re-attention successfully grounds corrections in visual evidence where standard decoding fails. We validate our approach on Qwen2.5-VL-7B [23], with plans to extend validation across diverse architectures in future versions. We release our code and methodology to facilitate future research in trustworthy multimodal systems.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently demonstrated remarkable potential in enhancing the reasoning capability of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, RLVR often leads to entropy collapse, resulting in premature policy convergence and performance saturation. While manipulating token-level entropy has proven effective for promoting policy exploration, we argue that the latent dynamics underlying token generation encode a far richer computational structure for steering policy optimization toward a more effective exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To enable tractable analysis and intervention of the latent dynamics of LRMs, we leverage Koopman operator theory to obtain a linearized representation of their hidden-state dynamics. This enables us to introduce Dynamic Spectral Dispersion (DSD), a new metric to quantify the heterogeneity of the model's latent dynamics, serving as a direct indicator of policy exploration. Building upon these foundations, we propose Reasoning with Latent eXploration (ReLaX), a paradigm that explicitly incorporates latent dynamics to regulate exploration and exploitation during policy optimization. Comprehensive experiments across a wide range of multimodal and text-only reasoning benchmarks show that ReLaX significantly mitigates premature convergence and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

        "summary": "City-scale 3D reconstruction from satellite imagery presents the challenge of extreme viewpoint extrapolation, where our goal is to synthesize ground-level novel views from sparse orbital images with minimal parallax. This requires inferring nearly $90^\\circ$ viewpoint gaps from image sources with severely foreshortened facades and flawed textures, causing state-of-the-art reconstruction engines such as NeRF and 3DGS to fail.\n  To address this problem, we propose two design choices tailored for city structures and satellite inputs. First, we model city geometry as a 2.5D height map, implemented as a Z-monotonic signed distance field (SDF) that matches urban building layouts from top-down viewpoints. This stabilizes geometry optimization under sparse, off-nadir satellite views and yields a watertight mesh with crisp roofs and clean, vertically extruded facades. Second, we paint the mesh appearance from satellite images via differentiable rendering techniques. While the satellite inputs may contain long-range, blurry captures, we further train a generative texture restoration network to enhance the appearance, recovering high-frequency, plausible texture details from degraded inputs.\n  Our method's scalability and robustness are demonstrated through extensive experiments on large-scale urban reconstruction. For example, in our teaser figure, we reconstruct a $4\\,\\mathrm{km}^2$ real-world region from only a few satellite images, achieving state-of-the-art performance in synthesizing photorealistic ground views. The resulting models are not only visually compelling but also serve as high-fidelity, application-ready assets for downstream tasks like urban planning and simulation.",

It has recently been shown that predefined vector systems, specifically An root system vectors, can be used as targets for latent space configurations (LSC) to ensure the desired LS structure. One of the main LSC advantage is the possibility of training classifier NNs without classification layers, which facilitates training NNs on datasets with extremely large numbers of classes. This paper provides a more general overview of possible vector systems for NN training along with their properties and methods for vector system construction. These systems are used to configure LS of encoders and visual transformers to significantly speed up ImageNet-1K and 50k-600k classes LSC training. It is also shown that using the minimum number of LS dimensions for a specific number of classes results in faster convergence. The latter has potential advantages for reducing the size of vector databases used to store NN embeddings.",

One prominent issue is vanishing point inconsistency, where projections of parallel lines fail to converge correctly in 2D space. This leads to structurally implausible geometry that degrades spatial realism, especially in architectural scenes. We propose ControlVP, a user-guided framework for correcting vanishing point inconsistencies in generated images. Our approach extends a pre-trained diffusion model by incorporating structural guidance derived from building contours. We also introduce geometric constraints that explicitly encourage alignment between image edges and perspective cues. Our method enhances global geometric consistency while maintaining visual fidelity comparable to the baselines. This capability is particularly valuable for applications that require accurate spatial structure, such as image-to-3D reconstruction.

To accelerate autoregressive text-to-image generation, we propose Speculative Jacobi Decoding++ (SJD++), a training-free probabilistic parallel decoding algorithm. Unlike traditional next-token prediction, SJD++ performs multi-token prediction in each forward pass, drastically reducing generation steps. Specifically, it integrates the iterative multi-token prediction mechanism from Jacobi decoding, with the probabilistic drafting-and-verification mechanism from speculative sampling. More importantly, for further acceleration, SJD++ reuses high-confidence draft tokens after each verification phase instead of resampling them all. We conduct extensive experiments on several representative autoregressive text-to-image generation models and demonstrate that SJD++ achieves $2\\times$ to $3\\times$ inference latency reduction and $2\\times$ to $7\\times$ step compression, while preserving visual quality with no observable degradation.",

        "title": "Towards Robust DeepFake Detection under Unstable Face Sequences: Adaptive Sparse Graph Embedding with Order-Free Representation and Explicit Laplacian Spectral Prior",
        "summary": "Ensuring the authenticity of video content remains challenging as DeepFake generation becomes increasingly realistic and robust against detection. Most existing detectors implicitly assume temporally consistent and clean facial sequences, an assumption that rarely holds in real-world scenarios where compression artifacts, occlusions, and adversarial attacks destabilize face detection and often lead to invalid or misdetected faces. To address these challenges, we propose a Laplacian-Regularized Graph Convolutional Network (LR-GCN) that robustly detects DeepFakes from noisy or unordered face sequences, while being trained only on clean facial data. Our method constructs an Order-Free Temporal Graph Embedding (OF-TGE) that organizes frame-wise CNN features into an adaptive sparse graph based on semantic affinities. Unlike traditional methods constrained by strict temporal continuity, OF-TGE captures intrinsic feature consistency across frames, making it resilient to shuffled, missing, or heavily corrupted inputs. We further impose a dual-level sparsity mechanism on both graph structure and node features to suppress the influence of invalid faces. Crucially, we introduce an explicit Graph Laplacian Spectral Prior that acts as a high-pass operator in the graph spectral domain, highlighting structural anomalies and forgery artifacts, which are then consolidated by a low-pass GCN aggregation. This sequential design effectively realizes a task-driven spectral band-pass mechanism that suppresses background information and random noise while preserving manipulation cues. Extensive experiments on FF++, Celeb-DFv2, and DFDC demonstrate that LR-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improved robustness under severe global and local disruptions, including missing faces, occlusions, and adversarially perturbed face detections.",

Some NVCs incorporate perceptual or adversarial objectives but still suffer from artifacts due to limited generation capacity, whereas others leverage pretrained diffusion models to improve quality at the cost of heavy sampling complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose S2VC, a Single-Step diffusion based Video Codec that integrates a conditional coding framework with an efficient single-step diffusion generator, enabling realistic reconstruction at low bitrates with reduced sampling cost. Recognizing the importance of semantic conditioning in single-step diffusion, we introduce Contextual Semantic Guidance to extract frame-adaptive semantics from buffered features. It replaces text captions with efficient, fine-grained conditioning, thereby improving generation realism. In addition, Temporal Consistency Guidance is incorporated into the diffusion U-Net to enforce temporal coherence across frames and ensure stable generation. Extensive experiments show that S2VC delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with an average 52.73% bitrate saving over prior perceptual methods, underscoring the promise of single-step diffusion for efficient, high-quality video compression.",

To resolve this conflict, we propose VideoCoF, a novel Chain-of-Frames approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought reasoning. VideoCoF enforces a ``see, reason, then edit\" procedure by compelling the video diffusion model to first predict reasoning tokens (edit-region latents) before generating the target video tokens. This explicit reasoning step removes the need for user-provided masks while achieving precise instruction-to-region alignment and fine-grained video editing. Furthermore, we introduce a RoPE alignment strategy that leverages these reasoning tokens to ensure motion alignment and enable length extrapolation beyond the training duration. We demonstrate that with a minimal data cost of only 50k video pairs, VideoCoF achieves state-of-the-art performance on VideoCoF-Bench, validating the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach.

We improve upon previous work by establishing a more uniform mapping between SMPL and avatar geometries. Second, we introduce a generative animation model that fully exploits the diversity of limited motion data. We focus on short-term transitions while maintaining long-term consistency through an identity-conditioned design. These two designs formulate our method as a two-stage framework: the first stage learns a latent space, while the second learns to generate animations within this latent space. We conducted experiments on both our latent space and animation model. We demonstrate that our latent space produces high-fidelity human geometry surpassing previous methods ($90\\%$ lower Chamfer Dist.). The animation model synthesizes diverse animations with detailed and natural dynamics ($2.2 \\times$ higher user study score), achieving the best results across all evaluation metrics.",

To mitigate KANs' computational overhead, variants like FastKAN leverage Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) to accelerate inference. In this work, we investigate integrating KAN architectures into the DreamerV3 framework. We introduce KAN-Dreamer, replacing specific MLP and convolutional components of DreamerV3 with KAN and FastKAN layers. To ensure efficiency within the JAX-based World Model, we implement a tailored, fully vectorized version with simplified grid management. We structure our investigation into three subsystems: Visual Perception, Latent Prediction, and Behavior Learning. Empirical evaluations on the DeepMind Control Suite (walker_walk) analyze sample efficiency, training time, and asymptotic performance. Experimental results demonstrate that utilizing our adapted FastKAN as a drop-in replacement for the Reward and Continue predictors yields performance on par with the original MLP-based architecture, maintaining parity in both sample efficiency and training speed.

        "summary": "Whole slide image (WSI) normalization remains a vital preprocessing step in computational pathology. Increasingly driven by deep learning, these models learn to approximate data distributions from training examples. This often results in outputs that gravitate toward the average, potentially masking diagnostically important features. More critically, they can introduce hallucinated content, artifacts that appear realistic but are not present in the original tissue, posing a serious threat to downstream analysis. These hallucinations are nearly impossible to detect visually, and current evaluation practices often overlook them. In this work, we demonstrate that the risk of hallucinations is real and underappreciated. While many methods perform adequately on public datasets, we observe a concerning frequency of hallucinations when these same models are retrained and evaluated on real-world clinical data. To address this, we propose a novel image comparison measure designed to automatically detect hallucinations in normalized outputs. Using this measure, we systematically evaluate several well-cited normalization methods retrained on real-world data, revealing significant inconsistencies and failures that are not captured by conventional metrics. Our findings underscore the need for more robust, interpretable normalization techniques and stricter validation protocols in clinical deployment.",

However, conventional methods either searched from costly differentiable optimization, which is neither efficient nor flexible, or learned a quantized DNN from the proxy (i.e., HAWQ) manually designed by human experts, which is labor-intensive and requires huge expert knowledge. Can we design a proxy without involving any human experts and training? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer by proposing a novel Large Language Models (LLMs)-driven Training-free Automatic Proxy (dubbed TAP) discovery framework, which reforms the design paradigm of MPQ by utilizing LLMs to find superior TAP tailored for MPQ, automatically. In addition, to bridge the gap between black-box LLMs and the tough MPQ task, we ingeniously propose simple Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) based reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' reasoning by optimizing prompts, which can construct a positive feedback loop between the LLM and the MPQ task, enabling LLMs to generate better TAP in the next evolution. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that TAP achieves state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we truly believe that our TAP will significantly contribute to the MPQ community by providing a new perspective on LLM-driven design algorithms.",

While existing solutions basically start from some preconceived behavioural model, in this work we propose an approach that starts directly from the data, adopting a data mining perspective. Our method searches the mobility events in the data that might be possible evidences of mutual interactions between individuals, and on top of them looks for complex, persistent patterns and time evolving configurations of events. The study of these patterns can provide new insights on the mechanics of mobility interactions between individuals, which can potentially help in improving existing simulation models. We instantiate the general methodology on two real case studies, one on cars and one on pedestrians, and a full experimental evaluation is performed, both in terms of performances, parameter sensitivity and interpretation of sample results.",

We further propose a novel interaction graph exteroception representation that explicitly captures fine-grained joint-to-joint spatial dependencies to facilitate network learning. Additionally, within it we devise a sparse edge-based attention mechanism that dynamically prunes redundant connections and emphasizes critical inter-agent spatial relations, thereby enhancing the robustness of interaction modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterAgent consistently outperforms multiple strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It enables producing coherent, physically plausible, and semantically faithful multi-agent behaviors from only text prompts. Our code and data will be released to facilitate future research.",

        "summary": "We introduce the task of Reconstructing Objects along Hand Interaction Timelines (ROHIT). We first define the Hand Interaction Timeline (HIT) from a rigid object's perspective. In a HIT, an object is first static relative to the scene, then is held in hand following contact, where its pose changes. This is usually followed by a firm grip during use, before it is released to be static again w.r.t. to the scene. We model these pose constraints over the HIT, and propose to propagate the object's pose along the HIT enabling superior reconstruction using our proposed Constrained Optimisation and Propagation (COP) framework. Importantly, we focus on timelines with stable grasps - i.e. where the hand is stably holding an object, effectively maintaining constant contact during use. This allows us to efficiently annotate, study, and evaluate object reconstruction in videos without 3D ground truth. We evaluate our proposed task, ROHIT, over two egocentric datasets, HOT3D and in-the-wild EPIC-Kitchens. In HOT3D, we curate 1.2K clips of stable grasps. In EPIC-Kitchens, we annotate 2.4K clips of stable grasps including 390 object instances across 9 categories from videos of daily interactions in 141 environments. Without 3D ground truth, we utilise 2D projection error to assess the reconstruction. Quantitatively, COP improves stable grasp reconstruction by 6.2-11.3% and HIT reconstruction by up to 24.5% with constrained pose propagation.",

While many recent works seek to enhance CNNs with global contextual understanding via self-attention-based Vision Transformers, these approaches often introduce significant computational overhead. In this work, we demonstrate that it is possible to retain strong global perception without relying on computationally expensive components. We present GlimmerNet, an ultra-lightweight convolutional network built on the principle of separating receptive field diversity from feature recombination. GlimmerNet introduces Grouped Dilated Depthwise Convolutions(GDBlocks), which partition channels into groups with distinct dilation rates, enabling multi-scale feature extraction at no additional parameter cost. To fuse these features efficiently, we design a novel Aggregator module that recombines cross-group representations using grouped pointwise convolution, significantly lowering parameter overhead. With just 31K parameters and 29% fewer FLOPs than the most recent baseline, GlimmerNet achieves a new state-of-the-art weighted F1-score of 0.966 on the UAV-focused AIDERv2 dataset.

Existing calibration methods typically assume fixed models or static distributions, resulting in degraded performance under real-world, dynamic test conditions. To address these challenges, we introduce Style Invariance as a Correctness Likelihood (SICL), a framework that leverages style-invariance for robust uncertainty estimation. SICL estimates instance-wise correctness likelihood by measuring prediction consistency across style-altered variants, requiring only the model's forward pass. This makes it a plug-and-play, backpropagation-free calibration module compatible with any TTA method.

        "title": "How Far are Modern Trackers from UAV-Anti-UAV? A Million-Scale Benchmark and New Baseline",
        "summary": "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer wide-ranging applications but also pose significant safety and privacy violation risks in areas like airport and infrastructure inspection, spurring the rapid development of Anti-UAV technologies in recent years. However, current Anti-UAV research primarily focuses on RGB, infrared (IR), or RGB-IR videos captured by fixed ground cameras, with little attention to tracking target UAVs from another moving UAV platform. To fill this gap, we propose a new multi-modal visual tracking task termed UAV-Anti-UAV, which involves a pursuer UAV tracking a target adversarial UAV in the video stream. Compared to existing Anti-UAV tasks, UAV-Anti-UAV is more challenging due to severe dual-dynamic disturbances caused by the rapid motion of both the capturing platform and the target. To advance research in this domain, we construct a million-scale dataset consisting of 1,810 videos, each manually annotated with bounding boxes, a language prompt, and 15 tracking attributes. Furthermore, we propose MambaSTS, a Mamba-based baseline method for UAV-Anti-UAV tracking, which enables integrated spatial-temporal-semantic learning. Specifically, we employ Mamba and Transformer models to learn global semantic and spatial features, respectively, and leverage the state space model's strength in long-sequence modeling to establish video-level long-term context via a temporal token propagation mechanism. We conduct experiments on the UAV-Anti-UAV dataset to validate the effectiveness of our method. A thorough experimental evaluation of 50 modern deep tracking algorithms demonstrates that there is still significant room for improvement in the UAV-Anti-UAV domain. The dataset and codes will be available at {\\color{magenta}https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking}.",

Such models have primarily been seen through the lens of interpretability so far, wherein they offer transparency by inferring predictions as a linear combination of semantic concepts. However, a linear combination is inherently limiting. So we propose the enhancement of concept-based learning models through propositional logic. We introduce a logic module that is carefully designed to connect the learned concepts from CBMs through differentiable logic operations, such that our proposed LogicCBM can go beyond simple weighted combinations of concepts to leverage various logical operations to yield the final predictions, while maintaining end-to-end learnability. Composing concepts using a set of logic operators enables the model to capture inter-concept relations, while simultaneously improving the expressivity of the model in terms of logic operations. Our empirical studies on well-known benchmarks and synthetic datasets demonstrate that these models have better accuracy, perform effective interventions and are highly interpretable.",

Our method constrains 2D Gaussians to localized regions and infers their attributes via hierarchical neural features on mesh faces. Gaussian subdivision is guided by an adaptive face subdivision strategy driven by a detail-aware loss function. Additionally, we leverage priors from a reconstruction foundation model to initialize Gaussian deformations, enabling robust reconstruction of general dynamic objects from a single static camera, previously extremely challenging for optimization-based methods.

        "summary": "This paper investigates and develops methods for detecting small objects in large-scale aerial images. Current approaches for detecting small objects in aerial images often involve image cropping and modifications to detector network architectures. Techniques such as sliding window cropping and architectural enhancements, including higher-resolution feature maps and attention mechanisms, are commonly employed. Given the growing importance of aerial imagery in various critical and industrial applications, the need for robust frameworks for small object detection becomes imperative. To address this need, we adopted the base SW-YOLO approach to enhance speed and accuracy in small object detection by refining cropping dimensions and overlap in sliding window usage and subsequently enhanced it through architectural modifications. we propose a novel model by modifying the base model architecture, including advanced feature extraction modules in the neck for feature map enhancement, integrating CBAM in the backbone to preserve spatial and channel information, and introducing a new head to boost small object detection accuracy. Finally, we compared our method with SAHI, one of the most powerful frameworks for processing large-scale images, and CZDet, which is also based on image cropping, achieving significant improvements in accuracy. The proposed model achieves significant accuracy gains on the VisDrone2019 dataset, outperforming baseline YOLOv5L detection by a substantial margin. Specifically, the final proposed model elevates the mAP .5.5 accuracy on the VisDrone2019 dataset from the base accuracy of 35.5 achieved by the YOLOv5L detector to 61.2. Notably, the accuracy of CZDet, which is another classic method applied to this dataset, is 58.36. This research demonstrates a significant improvement, achieving an increase in accuracy from 35.5 to 61.2.",

        "summary": "Benefiting from the inductive biases learned from large-scale datasets, open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) leverages the power of vision-language models, such as CLIP, to achieve remarkable progress without requiring task-specific training. However, due to CLIP's pre-training nature on image-text pairs, it tends to focus on global semantic alignment, resulting in suboptimal performance when associating fine-grained visual regions with text. This leads to noisy and inconsistent predictions, particularly in local areas. We attribute this to a dispersed bias stemming from its contrastive training paradigm, which is difficult to alleviate using CLIP features alone. To address this, we propose a structure-aware feature rectification approach that incorporates instance-specific priors derived directly from the image. Specifically, we construct a region adjacency graph (RAG) based on low-level features (e.g., colour and texture) to capture local structural relationships and use it to refine CLIP features by enhancing local discrimination. Extensive experiments show that our method effectively suppresses segmentation noise, improves region-level consistency, and achieves strong performance on multiple open-vocabulary segmentation benchmarks.",

        "summary": "Two traditions of interpretability have evolved side by side but seldom spoken to each other: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which prescribe what a concept should be, and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), which discover what concepts emerge. While CBMs use supervision to align activations with human-labeled concepts, SAEs rely on sparse coding to uncover emergent ones. We show that both paradigms instantiate the same geometric structure: each learns a set of linear directions in activation space whose nonnegative combinations form a concept cone. Supervised and unsupervised methods thus differ not in kind but in how they select this cone. Building on this view, we propose an operational bridge between the two paradigms. CBMs provide human-defined reference geometries, while SAEs can be evaluated by how well their learned cones approximate or contain those of CBMs. This containment framework yields quantitative metrics linking inductive biases -- such as SAE type, sparsity, or expansion ratio -- to emergence of plausible\\footnote{We adopt the terminology of \\citet{jacovi2020towards}, who distinguish between faithful explanations (accurately reflecting model computations) and plausible explanations (aligning with human intuition and domain knowledge). CBM concepts are plausible by construction -- selected or annotated by humans -- though not necessarily faithful to the true latent factors that organise the data manifold.} concepts. Using these metrics, we uncover a ``sweet spot'' in both sparsity and expansion factor that maximizes both geometric and semantic alignment with CBM concepts. Overall, our work unifies supervised and unsupervised concept discovery through a shared geometric framework, providing principled metrics to measure SAE progress and assess how well discovered concept align with plausible human concepts.",

        "summary": "The increasing use of synthetic media, particularly deepfakes, is an emerging challenge for digital content verification. Although recent studies use both audio and visual information, most integrate these cues within a single model, which remains vulnerable to modality mismatches, noise, and manipulation. To address this gap, we propose DeepAgent, an advanced multi-agent collaboration framework that simultaneously incorporates both visual and audio modalities for the effective detection of deepfakes. DeepAgent consists of two complementary agents. Agent-1 examines each video with a streamlined AlexNet-based CNN to identify the symbols of deepfake manipulation, while Agent-2 detects audio-visual inconsistencies by combining acoustic features, audio transcriptions from Whisper, and frame-reading sequences of images through EasyOCR. Their decisions are fused through a Random Forest meta-classifier that improves final performance by taking advantage of the different decision boundaries learned by each agent. This study evaluates the proposed framework using three benchmark datasets to demonstrate both component-level and fused performance. Agent-1 achieves a test accuracy of 94.35% on the combined Celeb-DF and FakeAVCeleb datasets. On the FakeAVCeleb dataset, Agent-2 and the final meta-classifier attain accuracies of 93.69% and 81.56%, respectively. In addition, cross-dataset validation on DeepFakeTIMIT confirms the robustness of the meta-classifier, which achieves a final accuracy of 97.49%, and indicates a strong capability across diverse datasets. These findings confirm that hierarchy-based fusion enhances robustness by mitigating the weaknesses of individual modalities and demonstrate the effectiveness of a multi-agent approach in addressing diverse types of manipulations in deepfakes.",

        "summary": "In controllable image generation, synthesizing coherent and consistent images from multiple reference inputs, i.e., Multi-Image Composition (MICo), remains a challenging problem, partly hindered by the lack of high-quality training data. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic study of MICo, categorizing it into 7 representative tasks and curate a large-scale collection of high-quality source images and construct diverse MICo prompts. Leveraging powerful proprietary models, we synthesize a rich amount of balanced composite images, followed by human-in-the-loop filtering and refinement, resulting in MICo-150K, a comprehensive dataset for MICo with identity consistency. We further build a Decomposition-and-Recomposition (De&Re) subset, where 11K real-world complex images are decomposed into components and recomposed, enabling both real and synthetic compositions. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we construct MICo-Bench with 100 cases per task and 300 challenging De&Re cases, and further introduce a new metric, Weighted-Ref-VIEScore, specifically tailored for MICo evaluation. Finally, we fine-tune multiple models on MICo-150K and evaluate them on MICo-Bench. The results show that MICo-150K effectively equips models without MICo capability and further enhances those with existing skills. Notably, our baseline model, Qwen-MICo, fine-tuned from Qwen-Image-Edit, matches Qwen-Image-2509 in 3-image composition while supporting arbitrary multi-image inputs beyond the latter's limitation.

        "summary": "Versatile 3D tasks (e.g., generation or editing) that distill from Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have attracted significant research interest for not relying on extensive 3D training data. However, T2I models exhibit limitations resulting from prior view bias, which produces conflicting appearances between different views of an object. This bias causes subject-words to preferentially activate prior view features during cross-attention (CA) computation, regardless of the target view condition. To overcome this limitation, we conduct a comprehensive mathematical analysis to reveal the root cause of the prior view bias in T2I models. Moreover, we find different UNet layers show different effects of prior view in CA. Therefore, we propose a novel framework, TD-Attn, which addresses multi-view inconsistency via two key components: (1) the 3D-Aware Attention Guidance Module (3D-AAG) constructs a view-consistent 3D attention Gaussian for subject-words to enforce spatial consistency across attention-focused regions, thereby compensating for the limited spatial information in 2D individual view CA maps; (2) the Hierarchical Attention Modulation Module (HAM) utilizes a Semantic Guidance Tree (SGT) to direct the Semantic Response Profiler (SRP) in localizing and modulating CA layers that are highly responsive to view conditions, where the enhanced CA maps further support the construction of more consistent 3D attention Gaussians. Notably, HAM facilitates semantic-specific interventions, enabling controllable and precise 3D editing. Extensive experiments firmly establish that TD-Attn has the potential to serve as a universal plugin, significantly enhancing multi-view consistency across 3D tasks.",

Considering aerial imagery (e.g., modern aerial photos collected through drones, historical photos from aerial archives, high-resolution satellite imagery, etc.) presents unique challenges because spatial resolution varies widely across datasets, the use of color is not consistent, targets often shrink to only a few pixels, and scenes contain very high object densities and objects with partial occlusions. This work presents Aerial-D, a new large-scale referring expression segmentation dataset for aerial imagery, comprising 37,288 images with 1,522,523 referring expressions that cover 259,709 annotated targets, spanning across individual object instances, groups of instances, and semantic regions covering 21 distinct classes that range from vehicles and infrastructure to land coverage types. The dataset was constructed through a fully automatic pipeline that combines systematic rule-based expression generation with a Large Language Model (LLM) enhancement procedure that enriched both the linguistic variety and the focus on visual details within the referring expressions. Filters were additionally used to simulate historic imaging conditions for each scene. We adopted the RSRefSeg architecture, and trained models on Aerial-D together with prior aerial datasets, yielding unified instance and semantic segmentation from text for both modern and historical images. Results show that the combined training achieves competitive performance on contemporary benchmarks, while maintaining strong accuracy under monochrome, sepia, and grainy degradations that appear in archival aerial photography.

However, recent observations suggest ViTs often spontaneously manifest a \"U-shaped\" entropy profile-compressing information in middle layers before expanding it for the final classification. In this work, we demonstrate that this \"Inductive Bottleneck\" is not an architectural artifact, but a data-dependent adaptation. By analyzing the layer-wise Effective Encoding Dimension (EED) of DINO-trained ViTs across datasets of varying compositional complexity (UC Merced, Tiny ImageNet, and CIFAR-100), we show that the depth of the bottleneck correlates strongly with the semantic abstraction required by the task. We find that while texture-heavy datasets preserve high-rank representations throughout, object-centric datasets drive the network to dampen high-frequency information in middle layers, effectively \"learning\" a bottleneck to isolate semantic features.",

Existing personalization methods often focus on facial identity but fail to preserve broader contextual cues such as hairstyle, outfit, and body shape, which are critical for visual coherence. We propose \\textbf{ContextAnyone}, a context-aware diffusion framework that achieves character-consistent video generation from text and a single reference image. Our method jointly reconstructs the reference image and generates new video frames, enabling the model to fully perceive and utilize reference information. Reference information is effectively integrated into a DiT-based diffusion backbone through a novel Emphasize-Attention module that selectively reinforces reference-aware features and prevents identity drift across frames. A dual-guidance loss combines diffusion and reference reconstruction objectives to enhance appearance fidelity, while the proposed Gap-RoPE positional embedding separates reference and video tokens to stabilize temporal modeling. Experiments demonstrate that ContextAnyone outperforms existing reference-to-video methods in identity consistency and visual quality, generating coherent and context-preserving character videos across diverse motions and scenes.

To assess the reproducibility and generalizability of their approach, we reimplemented the experiment from scratch using openly available resources and a different dataset consisting of 900 images spanning 90 species. After minimal preprocessing, we obtained an overall classification accuracy of 62%, closely aligning with the 71% reported in the original work despite differences in datasets. As in the original study, per-class performance varied substantially, as indicated by a macro F1 score of 0.28,highlighting limitations in generalization when labels do not align directly with ImageNet classes. Our results confirm that pretrained convolutional neural networks can provide a practical baseline for wildlife species identification but also reinforce the need for species-specific adaptation or transfer learning to achieve consistent, high-quality predictions.",

        "title": "Towards Accurate UAV Image Perception: Guiding Vision-Language Models with Stronger Task Prompts",
        "summary": "Existing image perception methods based on VLMs generally follow a paradigm wherein models extract and analyze image content based on user-provided textual task prompts. However, such methods face limitations when applied to UAV imagery, which presents challenges like target confusion, scale variations, and complex backgrounds. These challenges arise because VLMs' understanding of image content depends on the semantic alignment between visual and textual tokens. When the task prompt is simplistic and the image content is complex, achieving effective alignment becomes difficult, limiting the model's ability to focus on task-relevant information. To address this issue, we introduce AerialVP, the first agent framework for task prompt enhancement in UAV image perception. AerialVP proactively extracts multi-dimensional auxiliary information from UAV images to enhance task prompts, overcoming the limitations of traditional VLM-based approaches. Specifically, the enhancement process includes three stages: (1) analyzing the task prompt to identify the task type and enhancement needs, (2) selecting appropriate tools from the tool repository, and (3) generating enhanced task prompts based on the analysis and selected tools. To evaluate AerialVP, we introduce AerialSense, a comprehensive benchmark for UAV image perception that includes Aerial Visual Reasoning, Aerial Visual Question Answering, and Aerial Visual Grounding tasks. AerialSense provides a standardized basis for evaluating model generalization and performance across diverse resolutions, lighting conditions, and both urban and natural scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that AerialVP significantly enhances task prompt guidance, leading to stable and substantial performance improvements in both open-source and proprietary VLMs. Our work will be available at https://github.com/lostwolves/AerialVP.",

        "summary": "Three-dimensional geospatial analysis is critical to applications in urban planning, climate adaptation, and environmental assessment. Current methodologies depend on costly, specialized sensors (e.g., LiDAR and multispectral), which restrict global accessibility. Existing sensor-based and rule-driven methods further struggle with tasks requiring the integration of multiple 3D cues, handling diverse queries, and providing interpretable reasoning. We hereby present Geo3DVQA, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) in height-aware, 3D geospatial reasoning using RGB-only remote sensing imagery. Unlike conventional sensor-based frameworks, Geo3DVQA emphasizes realistic scenarios that integrate elevation, sky view factors, and land cover patterns. The benchmark encompasses 110k curated question-answer pairs spanning 16 task categories across three complexity levels: single-feature inference, multi-feature reasoning, and application-level spatial analysis. The evaluation of ten state-of-the-art VLMs highlights the difficulty of RGB-to-3D reasoning. GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash achieved only 28.6% and 33.0% accuracy respectively, while domain-specific fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B achieved 49.6% (+24.8 points). These results reveal both the limitations of current VLMs and the effectiveness of domain adaptation. Geo3DVQA introduces new challenge frontiers for scalable, accessible, and holistic 3D geospatial analysis.

        "summary": "In the field of healthcare, precise skin lesion segmentation is crucial for the early detection and accurate diagnosis of skin diseases. Despite significant advances in deep learning for image processing, existing methods have yet to effectively address the challenges of irregular lesion shapes and low contrast. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative encoder-decoder network architecture based on multi-scale residual structures, capable of extracting rich feature information from different receptive fields to effectively identify lesion areas. By introducing a Multi-Resolution Multi-Channel Fusion (MRCF) module, our method captures cross-scale features, enhancing the clarity and accuracy of the extracted information. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Mix Attention Module (CMAM), which redefines the attention scope and dynamically calculates weights across multiple contexts, thus improving the flexibility and depth of feature capture and enabling deeper exploration of subtle features. To overcome the information loss caused by skip connections in traditional U-Net, an External Attention Bridge (EAB) is introduced, facilitating the effective utilization of information in the decoder and compensating for the loss during upsampling. Extensive experimental evaluations on several skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing transformer and convolutional neural network-based models, showcasing exceptional segmentation accuracy and robustness.",

        "summary": "Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) is hindered by two key challenges: **inadequate sign representation** that fails to capture nuanced visual cues, and **sentence-level semantic misalignment** in current LLM-based methods, which limits translation quality. To address these issues, we propose a three-stage **r**einforcing **v**ision-**l**anguage **f**ramework (**RVLF**). We build a large vision-language model (LVLM) specifically designed for sign language, and then combine it with reinforcement learning (RL) to adaptively enhance translation performance. First, for a sufficient representation of sign language, RVLF introduces an effective semantic representation learning mechanism that fuses skeleton-based motion cues with semantically rich visual features extracted via DINOv2, followed by instruction tuning to obtain a strong SLT-SFT baseline. Then, to improve sentence-level semantic misalignment, we introduce a GRPO-based optimization strategy that fine-tunes the SLT-SFT model with a reward function combining translation fidelity (BLEU) and sentence completeness (ROUGE), yielding the optimized model termed SLT-GRPO. Our conceptually simple framework yields substantial gains under the gloss-free SLT setting without pre-training on any external large-scale sign language datasets, improving BLEU-4 scores by +5.1, +1.11, +1.4, and +1.61 on the CSL-Daily, PHOENIX-2014T, How2Sign, and OpenASL datasets, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to incorporate GRPO into SLT. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of GRPO-based optimization in enhancing both translation quality and semantic consistency.",

These models usually require 3D point clouds from laser scanners that are expensive to acquire and require specialist knowledge to use. In this article, we present a graph generation pipeline based on photogrammetry. The pipeline detects relevant objects and predicts their relation using RGB images and depth data generated by a stereo camera. This more cost-effective approach uses deep learning for object detection and instance segmentation of the objects, and employs user-defined heuristics or rules to infer their relations. Results of two hydraulic systems show that this strategy can produce graphs close to the ground truth while its flexibility allows the method to be tailored to specific applications and its transparency qualifies it to be used in the high stakes decision-making that is required for critical infrastructures.",

A key step in their use is grouping the images into clusters, which usually proceeds iteratively splitting the images into clusters and fitting a model for the images in each cluster. Linear subspaces have emerged as a suitable model for tile clusters; however, they are not well matched to images patches given that images are non-negative and thus not distributed around the origin in the tile vector space. We study the use of affine subspace models for the clusters to better match the geometric structure of the image tile vector space. We also present a simple denoising algorithm that relies on the affine subspace clustering model using least squares projection. We review several algorithmic approaches to solve the affine subspace clustering problem and show experimental results that highlight the performance improvements in clustering and denoising.",

        "summary": "Endoscopic surgery relies on intraoperative video, making image quality a decisive factor for surgical safety and efficacy. Yet, endoscopic videos are often degraded by uneven illumination, tissue scattering, occlusions, and motion blur, which obscure critical anatomical details and complicate surgical manipulation. Although deep learning-based methods have shown promise in image enhancement, most existing approaches remain too computationally demanding for real-time surgical use. To address this challenge, we propose a degradation-aware framework for endoscopic video enhancement, which enables real-time, high-quality enhancement by propagating degradation representations across frames. In our framework, degradation representations are first extracted from images using contrastive learning. We then introduce a fusion mechanism that modulates image features with these representations to guide a single-frame enhancement model, which is trained with a cycle-consistency constraint between degraded and restored images to improve robustness and generalization. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance between performance and efficiency compared with several state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of degradation-aware modeling for real-time endoscopic video enhancement. Nevertheless, our method suggests that implicitly learning and propagating degradation representation offer a practical pathway for clinical application.",

In medical imaging, it can support clinical decision-making, but current models often over-edit. This can distort organs, create false findings, and miss small tumors because these models do not understand anatomy or contrast dynamics. We propose SMILE, an anatomy-aware diffusion model that learns how organs are shaped and how they take up contrast. It enhances only clinically relevant regions while leaving all other areas unchanged. SMILE introduces three key ideas: (1) structure-aware supervision that follows true organ boundaries and contrast patterns; (2) registration-free learning that works directly with unaligned multi-phase CT scans; (3) unified inference that provides fast and consistent enhancement across all contrast phases. Across six external datasets, SMILE outperforms existing methods in image quality (14.2% higher SSIM, 20.6% higher PSNR, 50% better FID) and in clinical usefulness by producing anatomically accurate and diagnostically meaningful images. SMILE also improves cancer detection from non-contrast CT, raising the F1 score by up to 10 percent.",

        "summary": "Recent studies have extended diffusion-based instruction-driven 2D image editing pipelines to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), enabling faithful manipulation of 3DGS assets and greatly advancing 3DGS content creation. However, it also exposes these assets to serious risks of unauthorized editing and malicious tampering. Although imperceptible adversarial perturbations against diffusion models have proven effective for protecting 2D images, applying them to 3DGS encounters two major challenges: view-generalizable protection and balancing invisibility with protection capability. In this work, we propose the first editing safeguard for 3DGS, termed AdLift, which prevents instruction-driven editing across arbitrary views and dimensions by lifting strictly bounded 2D adversarial perturbations into 3D Gaussian-represented safeguard. To ensure both adversarial perturbations effectiveness and invisibility, these safeguard Gaussians are progressively optimized across training views using a tailored Lifted PGD, which first conducts gradient truncation during back-propagation from the editing model at the rendered image and applies projected gradients to strictly constrain the image-level perturbation. Then, the resulting perturbation is backpropagated to the safeguard Gaussian parameters via an image-to-Gaussian fitting operation. We alternate between gradient truncation and image-to-Gaussian fitting, yielding consistent adversarial-based protection performance across different viewpoints and generalizes to novel views. Empirically, qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that AdLift effectively protects against state-of-the-art instruction-driven 2D image and 3DGS editing.",

Large vision-language models can generate captions but are designed for general visual understanding, not classifier-specific reasoning. Existing zero-shot explanation methods align global image features with language, producing descriptions of what is visible rather than what drives the prediction. We propose TEXTER, which overcomes this limitation by isolating decision-critical features before alignment. TEXTER identifies the neurons contributing to the prediction and emphasizes the features encoded in those neurons -- i.e., the decision-critical features. It then maps these emphasized features into the CLIP feature space to retrieve textual explanations that reflect the model's reasoning. A sparse autoencoder further improves interpretability, particularly for Transformer architectures. Extensive experiments show that TEXTER generates more faithful and interpretable explanations than existing methods. The code will be publicly released.",

        "summary": "Brain tumors are one of the most common and dangerous neurological diseases which require a timely and correct diagnosis to provide the right treatment procedures. Even with the promotion of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the process of tumor delineation is difficult and time-consuming, which is prone to inter-observer error. In order to overcome these limitations, this work proposes a hybrid deep learning model based on SqueezeNet v1 which is a lightweight model, and EfficientNet-B0, which is a high-performing model, and is enhanced with handcrafted radiomic descriptors, including Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gabor filters and Wavelet transforms. The framework was trained and tested only on publicly available Nickparvar Brain Tumor MRI dataset, which consisted of 7,023 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted axial MRI slices which were categorized into four groups: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The testing accuracy of the model was 98.93% that reached a level of 99.08% with Test Time Augmentation (TTA) showing great generalization and power. The proposed hybrid network offers a compromise between computation efficiency and diagnostic accuracy compared to current deep learning structures and only has to be trained using fewer than 2.1 million parameters and less than 1.2 GFLOPs. The handcrafted feature addition allowed greater sensitivity in texture and the EfficientNet-B0 backbone represented intricate hierarchical features. The resulting model has almost clinical reliability in automated MRI-based classification of tumors highlighting its possibility of use in clinical decision-support systems.",

        "summary": "Transformers have emerged as a universal backbone across 3D perception, video generation, and world models for autonomous driving and embodied AI, where understanding camera geometry is essential for grounding visual observations in three-dimensional space. However, existing camera encoding methods often rely on simplified pinhole assumptions, restricting generalization across the diverse intrinsics and lens distortions in real-world cameras. We introduce Relative Ray Encoding, a geometry-consistent representation that unifies complete camera information, including 6-DoF poses, intrinsics, and lens distortions. To evaluate its capability under diverse controllability demands, we adopt camera-controlled text-to-video generation as a testbed task. Within this setting, we further identify pitch and roll as two components effective for Absolute Orientation Encoding, enabling full control over the initial camera orientation. Together, these designs form UCPE (Unified Camera Positional Encoding), which integrates into a pretrained video Diffusion Transformer through a lightweight spatial attention adapter, adding less than 1% trainable parameters while achieving state-of-the-art camera controllability and visual fidelity. To facilitate systematic training and evaluation, we construct a large video dataset covering a wide range of camera motions and lens types. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of UCPE in camera-controllable video generation and highlight its potential as a general camera representation for Transformers across future multi-view, video, and 3D tasks.

        "title": "Dropout Prompt Learning: Towards Robust and Adaptive Vision-Language Models",
        "summary": "Dropout is a widely used regularization technique which improves the generalization ability of a model by randomly dropping neurons. In light of this, we propose Dropout Prompt Learning, which aims for applying dropout to improve the robustness of the vision-language models. Different from the vanilla dropout, we apply dropout on the tokens of the textual and visual branches, where we evaluate the token significance considering both intra-modal context and inter-modal alignment, enabling flexible dropout probabilities for each token. Moreover, to maintain semantic alignment for general knowledge transfer while encouraging the diverse representations that dropout introduces, we further propose residual entropy regularization. Experiments on 15 benchmarks show our method's effectiveness in challenging scenarios like low-shot learning, long-tail classification, and out-of-distribution generalization. Notably, our method surpasses regularization-based methods including KgCoOp by 5.10% and PromptSRC by 2.13% in performance on base-to-novel generalization.",

        "summary": "Text as signs, labels, or instructions is a critical element of real-world scenes as they can convey important contextual information. 3D representations such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggle to preserve fine-grained text details, while achieving high visual fidelity. Small errors in textual element reconstruction can lead to significant semantic loss. We propose STRinGS, a text-aware, selective refinement framework to address this issue for 3DGS reconstruction. Our method treats text and non-text regions separately, refining text regions first and merging them with non-text regions later for full-scene optimization. STRinGS produces sharp, readable text even in challenging configurations. We introduce a text readability measure OCR Character Error Rate (CER) to evaluate the efficacy on text regions. STRinGS results in a 63.6% relative improvement over 3DGS at just 7K iterations. We also introduce a curated dataset STRinGS-360 with diverse text scenarios to evaluate text readability in 3D reconstruction. Our method and dataset together push the boundaries of 3D scene understanding in text-rich environments, paving the way for more robust text-aware reconstruction methods.",

        "summary": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) faces the challenge of categorizing unlabeled data containing both known and novel classes, given only labels for known classes. Previous studies often treat each class independently, neglecting the inherent inter-class relations. Obtaining such inter-class relations directly presents a significant challenge in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we propose ReLKD, an end-to-end framework that effectively exploits implicit inter-class relations and leverages this knowledge to enhance the classification of novel classes. ReLKD comprises three key modules: a target-grained module for learning discriminative representations, a coarse-grained module for capturing hierarchical class relations, and a distillation module for transferring knowledge from the coarse-grained module to refine the target-grained module's representation learning. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ReLKD, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.

        "summary": "DeepFake face swapping enables highly realistic identity forgeries, posing serious privacy and security risks. A common defence embeds invisible perturbations into images, but these are fragile and often destroyed by basic transformations such as compression or resizing. In this paper, we first conduct a systematic analysis of 30 transformations across six categories and show that protection robustness is highly sensitive to the choice of training transformations, making the standard Expectation over Transformation (EOT) with uniform sampling fundamentally suboptimal. Motivated by this, we propose Expectation Over Learned distribution of Transformation (EOLT), the framework to treat transformation distribution as a learnable component rather than a fixed design choice. Specifically, EOLT employs a policy network that learns to automatically prioritize critical transformations and adaptively generate instance-specific perturbations via reinforcement learning, enabling explicit modeling of defensive bottlenecks while maintaining broad transferability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art approaches, with 26% higher average robustness and up to 30% gains on challenging transformation categories.",

        "summary": "Segmentation is the identification of anatomical regions of interest, such as organs, tissue, and lesions, serving as a fundamental task in computer-aided diagnosis in medical imaging. Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance in medical image segmentation, the need for explainability remains critical for ensuring their acceptance and integration in clinical practice, despite the growing research attention in this area. Our approach explored the use of contrast-level Shapley values, a systematic perturbation of model inputs to assess feature importance. While other studies have investigated gradient-based techniques through identifying influential regions in imaging inputs, Shapley values offer a broader, clinically aligned approach, explaining how model performance is fairly attributed to certain imaging contrasts over others. Using the BraTS 2024 dataset, we generated rankings for Shapley values for four MRI contrasts across four model architectures. Two metrics were proposed from the Shapley ranking: agreement between model and ``clinician\" imaging ranking, and uncertainty quantified through Shapley ranking variance across cross-validation folds. Higher-performing cases (Dice \\textgreater0.6) showed significantly greater agreement with clinical rankings. Increased Shapley ranking variance correlated with decreased performance (U-Net: $r=-0.581$). These metrics provide clinically interpretable proxies for model reliability, helping clinicians better understand state-of-the-art segmentation models.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach that leverages deep learning for pose distribution estimation without relying on RGB input.

Methods: The AutoLugano system processes baseline FDG-PET/CT scans through three sequential modules:(1) Anatomy-Informed Lesion Segmentation, a 3D nnU-Net model, trained on multi-channel inputs, performs automated lesion detection (2) Atlas-based Anatomical Localization, which leverages the TotalSegmentator toolkit to map segmented lesions to 21 predefined lymph node regions using deterministic anatomical rules; and (3) Automated Lugano Staging, where the spatial distribution of involved regions is translated into Lugano stages and therapeutic groups (Limited vs. Advanced Stage).The system was trained on the public autoPET dataset (n=1,007) and externally validated on an independent cohort of 67 patients. Performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-scorefor regional involvement detection and staging agreement. Results: On the external validation set, the proposed model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 88.31%, sensitivity of 74.47%, Specificity of 94.21% and an F1-score of 80.80% for regional involvement detection,outperforming baseline models. Most notably, for the critical clinical task of therapeutic stratification (Limited vs. Advanced Stage), the system achieved a high accuracy of 85.07%, with a specificity of 90.48% and a sensitivity of 82.61%.Conclusion: AutoLugano represents the first fully automated, end-to-end pipeline that translates a single baseline FDG-PET/CT scan into a complete Lugano stage.

MMRPT constructs masked multimodal data by estimating sentence-level visual dependency via attention over visual tokens and masking highly vision-dependent segments; the model reconstructs these spans through vision-grounded reasoning guided by a semantic-visual reward.

These connections form Chains-of-Reasoning (CoRs) within the image, enabling viewers to infer events, causal relationships, and other information, thereby understanding the underlying story. In this paper, we focus on these semantically rich images and define them as Storytelling Images. Such images have diverse applications beyond illustration creation and cognitive screening, leveraging their ability to convey multi-layered information visually and inspire active interpretation. However, due to their complex semantic nature, Storytelling Images are inherently challenging to create, and thus remain relatively scarce. To address this challenge, we introduce the Storytelling Image Generation task, which explores how generative AI models can be leveraged to create such images. Specifically, we propose a two-stage pipeline, StorytellingPainter, which combines the creative reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the visual synthesis capabilities of Text-to-Image (T2I) models to generate Storytelling Images. Alongside this pipeline, we develop a dedicated evaluation framework comprising three main evaluators: a Semantic Complexity Evaluator, a KNN-based Diversity Evaluator and a Story-Image Alignment Evaluator. Given the critical role of story generation in the Storytelling Image Generation task and the performance disparity between open-source and proprietary LLMs, we further explore tailored training strategies to reduce this gap, resulting in a series of lightweight yet effective models named Mini-Storytellers. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approaches. The code is available at https://github.com/xiujiesong/StorytellingImageGeneration.",

        "summary": "Generative learned image compression methods using Vector Quantization (VQ) have recently shown impressive potential in balancing distortion and perceptual quality. However, these methods typically estimate the entropy of VQ indices using a static, global probability distribution, which fails to adapt to the specific content of each image. This non-adaptive approach leads to untapped bitrate potential and challenges in achieving flexible rate control. To address this challenge, we introduce a Controllable Generative Image Compression framework based on a VQ Hyperprior, termed HVQ-CGIC. HVQ-CGIC rigorously derives the mathematical foundation for introducing a hyperprior to the VQ indices entropy model. Based on this foundation, through novel loss design, to our knowledge, this framework is the first to introduce RD balance and control into vector quantization-based Generative Image Compression. Cooperating with a lightweight hyper-prior estimation network, HVQ-CGIC achieves a significant advantage in rate-distortion (RD) performance compared to current state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative compression methods. On the Kodak dataset, we achieve the same LPIPS as Control-GIC, CDC and HiFiC with an average of 61.3% fewer bits. We posit that HVQ-CGIC has the potential to become a foundational component for VQGAN-based image compression, analogous to the integral role of the HyperPrior framework in neural image compression.",

        "summary": "Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to intensity inhomogeneity, noise, blurred boundaries, and irregular structures. Traditional level set methods, while effective in certain cases, often depend on approximate bias field estimations and therefore struggle under severe non-uniform imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel variational Reflectance-based Level Set Model (RefLSM), which explicitly integrates Retinex-inspired reflectance decomposition into the segmentation framework. By decomposing the observed image into reflectance and bias field components, RefLSM directly segments the reflectance, which is invariant to illumination and preserves fine structural details. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key innovations for enhanced precision and robustness. First, a linear structural prior steers the smoothed reflectance gradients toward a data-driven reference, providing reliable geometric guidance in noisy or low-contrast scenes. Second, a relaxed binary level-set is embedded in RefLSM and enforced via convex relaxation and sign projection, yielding stable evolution and avoiding reinitialization-induced diffusion. The resulting variational problem is solved efficiently using an ADMM-based optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrate that RefLSM achieves superior segmentation accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art level set methods.",

        "title": "Integrating Multi-scale and Multi-filtration Topological Features for Medical Image Classification",
        "summary": "Modern deep neural networks have shown remarkable performance in medical image classification. However, such networks either emphasize pixel-intensity features instead of fundamental anatomical structures (e.g., those encoded by topological invariants), or they capture only simple topological features via single-parameter persistence. In this paper, we propose a new topology-guided classification framework that extracts multi-scale and multi-filtration persistent topological features and integrates them into vision classification backbones. For an input image, we first compute cubical persistence diagrams (PDs) across multiple image resolutions/scales. We then develop a ``vineyard'' algorithm that consolidates these PDs into a single, stable diagram capturing signatures at varying granularities, from global anatomy to subtle local irregularities that may indicate early-stage disease. To further exploit richer topological representations produced by multiple filtrations, we design a cross-attention-based neural network that directly processes the consolidated final PDs. The resulting topological embeddings are fused with feature maps from CNNs or Transformers. By integrating multi-scale and multi-filtration topologies into an end-to-end architecture, our approach enhances the model's capacity to recognize complex anatomical structures. Evaluations on three public datasets show consistent, considerable improvements over strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the value of our comprehensive topological perspective for robust and interpretable medical image classification.",

        "summary": "Chart understanding is crucial for deploying multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios such as analyzing scientific papers and technical reports. Unlike natural images, charts pair a structured visual layout (spatial property) with an underlying data representation (textual property) -- grasping both is essential for precise, fine-grained chart reasoning. Motivated by this observation, we propose START, the Spatial and Textual learning for chART understanding. Specifically, we introduce (i) chart-element grounding and (ii) chart-to-code generation to strengthen an MLLM's understanding of both chart visual layout and data details. To facilitate spatial and textual learning, we propose the START-Dataset generated with a novel data-generation pipeline that first leverages an MLLM to translate real chart images into executable chart code, recovering the underlying data representation while preserving the visual distribution of real-world charts. We then evolve the code with a Large Language Model (LLM) to ascertain the positions of chart elements that capture the chart's visual structure, addressing challenges that existing methods cannot handle. To evaluate a model's ability to understand chart spatial structures, we propose the Chart Spatial understanding Benchmark (CS-Bench), filling a critical gap in comprehensive chart understanding evaluation. Leveraging spatial and textual learning, START delivers consistent gains across model sizes and benchmarks over the base models and surpasses prior state-of-the-art by a clear margin.

        "summary": "Underwater image restoration is essential for marine applications ranging from ecological monitoring to archaeological surveys, but effectively addressing the complex and spatially varying nature of underwater degradations remains a challenge. Existing methods typically apply uniform restoration strategies across the entire image, struggling to handle multiple co-occurring degradations that vary spatially and with water conditions. We introduce TIDE, a $\\underline{t}$wo stage $\\underline{i}$nverse $\\underline{d}$egradation $\\underline{e}$stimation framework that explicitly models degradation characteristics and applies targeted restoration through specialized prior decomposition. Our approach disentangles the restoration process into multiple specialized hypotheses that are adaptively fused based on local degradation patterns, followed by a progressive refinement stage that corrects residual artifacts. Specifically, TIDE decomposes underwater degradations into four key factors, namely color distortion, haze, detail loss, and noise, and designs restoration experts specialized for each. By generating specialized restoration hypotheses, TIDE balances competing degradation factors and produces natural results even in highly degraded regions. Extensive experiments across both standard benchmarks and challenging turbid water conditions show that TIDE achieves competitive performance on reference based fidelity metrics while outperforming state of the art methods on non reference perceptual quality metrics, with strong improvements in color correction and contrast enhancement.

        "title": "Towards Unified Semantic and Controllable Image Fusion: A Diffusion Transformer Approach",
        "summary": "Image fusion aims to blend complementary information from multiple sensing modalities, yet existing approaches remain limited in robustness, adaptability, and controllability. Most current fusion networks are tailored to specific tasks and lack the ability to flexibly incorporate user intent, especially in complex scenarios involving low-light degradation, color shifts, or exposure imbalance. Moreover, the absence of ground-truth fused images and the small scale of existing datasets make it difficult to train an end-to-end model that simultaneously understands high-level semantics and performs fine-grained multimodal alignment. We therefore present DiTFuse, instruction-driven Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) framework that performs end-to-end, semantics-aware fusion within a single model. By jointly encoding two images and natural-language instructions in a shared latent space, DiTFuse enables hierarchical and fine-grained control over fusion dynamics, overcoming the limitations of pre-fusion and post-fusion pipelines that struggle to inject high-level semantics. The training phase employs a multi-degradation masked-image modeling strategy, so the network jointly learns cross-modal alignment, modality-invariant restoration, and task-aware feature selection without relying on ground truth images. A curated, multi-granularity instruction dataset further equips the model with interactive fusion capabilities. DiTFuse unifies infrared-visible, multi-focus, and multi-exposure fusion-as well as text-controlled refinement and downstream tasks-within a single architecture. Experiments on public IVIF, MFF, and MEF benchmarks confirm superior quantitative and qualitative performance, sharper textures, and better semantic retention. The model also supports multi-level user control and zero-shot generalization to other multi-image fusion scenarios, including instruction-conditioned segmentation.",

Existing studies, though effectively obscure private information in MLLMs, often overlook the evaluation of the authenticity and recovery quality of user privacy. To this end, this work uniquely focuses on the critical challenge of how to restore surrogate-driven protected data in diverse MLLM scenarios. We first bridge this research gap by contributing the SPPE (Surrogate Privacy Protected Editable) dataset, which includes a wide range of privacy categories and user instructions to simulate real MLLM applications. This dataset offers protected surrogates alongside their various MLLM-edited versions, thus enabling the direct assessment of privacy recovery quality. By formulating privacy recovery as a guided generation task conditioned on complementary multimodal signals, we further introduce a unified approach that reliably reconstructs private content while preserving the fidelity of MLLM-generated edits. The experiments on both SPPE and InstructPix2Pix further show that our approach generalizes well across diverse visual content and editing tasks, achieving a strong balance between privacy protection and MLLM usability.",

While recent pose-free feed-forward methods leveraging pre-trained 3D priors have achieved impressive results, most of them rely on full fine-tuning of large Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones and incur substantial GPU costs. In this work, we introduce MuSASplat, a novel framework that dramatically reduces the computational burden of training pose-free feed-forward 3D Gaussian splats models with little compromise of rendering quality. Central to our approach is a lightweight Multi-Scale Adapter that enables efficient fine-tuning of ViT-based architectures with only a small fraction of training parameters. This design avoids the prohibitive GPU overhead associated with previous full-model adaptation techniques while maintaining high fidelity in novel view synthesis, even with very sparse input views. In addition, we introduce a Feature Fusion Aggregator that integrates features across input views effectively and efficiently. Unlike widely adopted memory banks, the Feature Fusion Aggregator ensures consistent geometric integration across input views and meanwhile mitigates the memory usage, training complexity, and computational costs significantly. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets show that MuSASplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality but has significantly reduced parameters and training resource requirements as compared with existing methods.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models exhibit remarkable generative ability, yet achieving smooth and semantically consistent image morphing remains a challenge. Existing approaches often yield abrupt transitions or over-saturated appearances due to the lack of adaptive structural and semantic alignments. We propose CHIMERA, a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that formulates morphing as a cached inversion-guided denoising process. To handle large semantic and appearance disparities, we propose Adaptive Cache Injection and Semantic Anchor Prompting. Adaptive Cache Injection (ACI) caches down, mid, and up blocks features from both inputs during DDIM inversion and re-injects them adaptively during denoising, enabling spatial and semantic alignment in depth- and time-adaptive manners and enabling natural feature fusion and smooth transitions. Semantic Anchor Prompting (SAP) leverages a vision-language model to generate a shared anchor prompt that serves as a semantic anchor, bridging dissimilar inputs and guiding the denoising process toward coherent results. Finally, we introduce the Global-Local Consistency Score (GLCS), a morphing-oriented metric that simultaneously evaluates the global harmonization of the two inputs and the smoothness of the local morphing transition. Extensive experiments and user studies show that CHIMERA achieves smoother and more semantically aligned transitions than existing methods, establishing a new state of the art in image morphing.

        "summary": "The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis asserts the existence of highly sparse, trainable subnetworks ('winning tickets') within dense, randomly initialized neural networks. However, state-of-the-art methods of drawing these tickets, like Lottery Ticket Rewinding (LTR), are computationally prohibitive, while more efficient saliency-based Pruning-at-Initialization (PaI) techniques suffer from a significant accuracy-sparsity trade-off and fail basic sanity checks. In this work, we argue that PaI's reliance on first-order saliency metrics, which ignore inter-weight dependencies, contributes substantially to this performance gap, especially in the sparse regime. To address this, we introduce Concrete Ticket Search (CTS), an algorithm that frames subnetwork discovery as a holistic combinatorial optimization problem. By leveraging a Concrete relaxation of the discrete search space and a novel gradient balancing scheme (GRADBALANCE) to control sparsity, CTS efficiently identifies high-performing subnetworks near initialization without requiring sensitive hyperparameter tuning. Motivated by recent works on lottery ticket training dynamics, we further propose a knowledge distillation-inspired family of pruning objectives, finding that minimizing the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence between sparse and dense network outputs (CTS-KL) is particularly effective. Experiments on varying image classification tasks show that CTS produces subnetworks that robustly pass sanity checks and achieve accuracy comparable to or exceeding LTR, while requiring only a small fraction of the computation. For example, on ResNet-20 on CIFAR10, it reaches 99.3% sparsity with 74.0% accuracy in 7.9 minutes, while LTR attains the same sparsity with 68.3% accuracy in 95.2 minutes. CTS's subnetworks outperform saliency-based methods across all sparsities, but its advantage over LTR is most pronounced in the highly sparse regime.",

        "summary": "As multimodal reasoning improves the overall capabilities of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), recent studies have begun to explore safety-oriented reasoning, aiming to enhance safety awareness by analyzing potential safety risks during the reasoning process before generating the final response. Although such approaches improve safety awareness and interpretability, this single-pass think-then-answer paradigm remains vulnerable to contextual or visual jailbreak attacks. This reveals a critical flaw: single-pass reasoning may overlook explicit harmful content in its own output. Our key insight is to exploit this wasted signal through reflection, which can effectively leverage the malicious content revealed in the first-pass reasoning to enable genuine self-correction and prevent unsafe generations. Motivated by this, we propose Think-Reflect-Revise (TRR), a three-stage training framework designed to enhance the safety alignment of LVLMs through policy-guided self-reflection. We first build a Reflective Safety Reasoning (ReSafe) dataset with 5,000 examples that follow a think-reflect-revise process. We then fine-tune the target model using the ReSafe dataset to initialize reflective behavior, and finally reinforce policy-guided reflection through reinforcement learning. Experimental results show that TRR substantially improves the safety performance of LVLMs across both safety-awareness benchmarks and jailbreak attack evaluations, increasing the overall safe response rate from 42.8% to 87.7% on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, while preserving stable performance on general benchmarks such as MMMU and MMStar.

Beyond recognition, recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable detailed descriptions and causal reasoning, motivating new tasks: human action understanding (HAU) and human action reasoning (HARn). However, most LLMs, especially large vision language models (LVLMs), struggle with non-RGB modalities such as depth, IMU, and mmWave due to the lack of large-scale data-caption resources. Existing HAR datasets mainly provide coarse data-label annotations, which are insufficient to capture fine-grained action dynamics needed for HAU and HARn. We consider two ground-truth pair types: (1) data label (discrete category) and (2) data caption (textual description). Naively generating captions from labels often lacks logical and spatiotemporal consistency. We introduce CUHK-X, a large-scale multimodal dataset and benchmark suite for HAR, HAU, and HARn. CUHK-X contains 58,445 samples covering 40 actions performed by 30 participants across two indoor environments. To improve caption consistency, we propose a prompt-based scene creation method that leverages LLMs to generate logically connected activity sequences, followed by human validation. CUHK-X includes three benchmarks with six evaluation tasks. Experiments report average accuracies of 76.52% (HAR), 40.76% (HAU), and 70.25% (HARn).

To address these issues, we explore improvements in two key areas. For problem 1, we employ MoE to apply different trajectory priors tailored to different scenarios. For problem 2, we utilize Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune the trajectory scoring mechanism. Additionally, we integrate models with different perception backbones to enhance perceptual features.

        "summary": "Specialized visual tools can augment large language models or vision language models with expert knowledge (e.g., grounding, spatial reasoning, medical knowledge, etc.), but knowing which tools to call (and when to call them) can be challenging. We introduce DART, a multi-agent framework that uses disagreements between multiple debating visual agents to identify useful visual tools (e.g., object detection, OCR, spatial reasoning, etc.) that can resolve inter-agent disagreement. These tools allow for fruitful multi-agent discussion by introducing new information, and by providing tool-aligned agreement scores that highlight agents in agreement with expert tools, thereby facilitating discussion. We utilize an aggregator agent to select the best answer by providing the agent outputs and tool information. We test DART on four diverse benchmarks and show that our approach improves over multi-agent debate as well as over single agent tool-calling frameworks, beating the next-strongest baseline (multi-agent debate with a judge model) by 3.4% and 2.4% on A-OKVQA and MMMU respectively. We also find that DART adapts well to new tools in applied domains, with a 1.3% improvement on the M3D medical dataset over other strong tool-calling, single agent, and multi-agent baselines. Additionally, we measure text overlap across rounds to highlight the rich discussion in DART compared to existing multi-agent methods. Finally, we study the tool call distribution, finding that diverse tools are reliably used to help resolve disagreement.",

        "summary": "End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a pivotal direction in the field of autonomous systems. Recent works have demonstrated impressive performance by incorporating high-level guidance signals to steer low-level trajectory planners. However, their potential is often constrained by inaccurate high-level guidance and the computational overhead of complex guidance modules. To address these limitations, we propose Mimir, a novel hierarchical dual-system framework capable of generating robust trajectories relying on goal points with uncertainty estimation: (1) Unlike previous approaches that deterministically model, we estimate goal point uncertainty with a Laplace distribution to enhance robustness; (2) To overcome the slow inference speed of the guidance system, we introduce a multi-rate guidance mechanism that predicts extended goal points in advance. Validated on challenging Navhard and Navtest benchmarks, Mimir surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods with a 20% improvement in the driving score EPDMS, while achieving 1.6 times improvement in high-level module inference speed without compromising accuracy. The code and models will be released soon to promote reproducibility and further development. The code is available at https://github.com/ZebinX/Mimir-Uncertainty-Driving",

Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging region-proposal information to map visual regions with corresponding sentences from lengthy captions, yet incurring notable deployment costs. We introduce MulCLIP, a novel end-to-end multi-level alignment framework that bridges natural long-text structures with image components. MulCLIP first preserves global contrastive alignment between images and both summary and long captions, while extending positional embeddings for longer text sequences. To further enhance fine-grained understanding, we propose two novel strategies: (1) a token reconstruction alignment over locally calibrated features to strengthen semantic connections between words and image patches, and (2) a subcaption-aggregated patch alignment that automatically extracts and aggregates context-rich patches for each subcaption. Experimental results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate our method consistently improves downstream performance, while ablation studies confirm its multi-scale alignment is the key factor driving better fine-grained capability than region-proposal-assisted approaches, making it particularly suitable for diverse real-world applications.",

        "summary": "VTON (Virtual Try-ON) aims at synthesizing the target clothing on a certain person, preserving the details of the target clothing while keeping the rest of the person unchanged. Existing methods suffer from the discrepancies between the generated clothing results and the target ones, in terms of the patterns, textures and boundaries. Therefore, we propose to use an energy function to impose constraints on the attention map extracted through the generation process. Thus, at each generation step, the attention can be more focused on the clothing region of interest, thereby influencing the generation results to be more consistent with the target clothing details. Furthermore, to address the limitation that existing evaluation metrics concentrate solely on image realism and overlook the alignment with target elements, we design a new metric, Virtual Try-on Inception Distance (VTID), to bridge this gap and ensure a more comprehensive assessment. On the VITON-HD and DressCode datasets, our approach has outperformed the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 1.4%, 2.3%, 12.3%, and 5.8% in the traditional metrics of LPIPS, FID, KID, and the new VTID metrics, respectively.

        "summary": "Copy-move image forgery aims to duplicate certain objects or to hide specific contents with copy-move operations, which can be achieved by a sequence of manual manipulations as well as up-to-date deep generative network-based swapping. Its detection is becoming increasingly challenging for the complex transformations and fine-tuned operations on the tampered regions. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stream model, namely Multi-directional Similarity Network (MSN), to accurate and efficient copy-move forgery detection. It addresses the two major limitations of existing deep detection models in \\textbf{representation} and \\textbf{localization}, respectively. In representation, an image is hierarchically encoded by a multi-directional CNN network, and due to the diverse augmentation in scales and rotations, the feature achieved better measures the similarity between sampled patches in two streams. In localization, we design a 2-D similarity matrix based decoder, and compared with the current 1-D similarity vector based one, it makes full use of spatial information in the entire image, leading to the improvement in detecting tampered regions. Beyond the method, a new forgery database generated by various deep neural networks is presented, as a new benchmark for detecting the growing deep-synthesized copy-move. Extensive experiments are conducted on two classic image forensics benchmarks, \\emph{i.e.} CASIA CMFD and CoMoFoD, and the newly presented one.

While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have extended toward mesh reconstruction and physically-based rendering (PBR), their geometry is still learned from 2D renderings, leading to coarse surfaces and unreliable BRDF-lighting decomposition. To address these limitations, COREA introduces a coarse-to-fine bidirectional 3D-to-3D alignment strategy that allows geometric signals to be learned directly in 3D space. Within this strategy, depth provides coarse alignment between the two representations, while depth gradients and normals refine fine-scale structure, and the resulting geometry supports stable BRDF-lighting decomposition. A density-control mechanism further stabilizes Gaussian growth, balancing geometric fidelity with memory efficiency. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that COREA achieves superior performance in novel-view synthesis, mesh reconstruction, and PBR within a unified framework.",

        "summary": "Detecting small objects in UAV remote sensing images and identifying surface defects in industrial inspection remain difficult tasks. These applications face common obstacles: features are sparse and weak, backgrounds are cluttered, and object scales vary dramatically. Current transformer-based detectors, while powerful, struggle with three critical issues. First, features degrade severely as networks downsample progressively. Second, spatial convolutions cannot capture long-range dependencies effectively. Third, standard upsampling methods inflate feature maps unnecessarily.\n  We introduce DFIR-DETR to tackle these problems through dynamic feature aggregation combined with frequency-domain processing. Our architecture builds on three novel components. The DCFA module uses dynamic K-sparse attention, cutting complexity from O(N2) down to O(NK), and employs spatial gated linear units for better nonlinear modeling. The DFPN module applies amplitude-normalized upsampling to prevent feature inflation and uses dual-path shuffle convolution to retain spatial details across scales. The FIRC3 module operates in the frequency domain, achieving global receptive fields without sacrificing efficiency.\n  We tested our method extensively on NEU-DET and VisDrone datasets. Results show mAP50 scores of 92.9% and 51.6% respectively-both state-of-the-art. The model stays lightweight with just 11.7M parameters and 41.2 GFLOPs. Strong performance across two very different domains confirms that DFIR-DETR generalizes well and works effectively in resource-limited settings for cross-scene small object detection.",

Our experimental results show a level of compression comparable to that of using JPEG using six different metrics.

        "summary": "Although diffusion models with strong visual priors have emerged as powerful dense prediction backboens, they overlook a core limitation: the stochastic noise at the core of diffusion sampling is inherently misaligned with dense prediction that requires a deterministic mapping from image to geometry. In this paper, we show that this stochastic noise corrupts fine-grained spatial cues and pushes the model toward timestep-specific noise objectives, consequently destroying meaningful geometric structure mappings. To address this, we introduce $\\mathrm{D}^{\\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor, a noise-free deterministic framework built by reformulating a pretrained diffusion model without stochasticity noise. Instead of relying on noisy inputs to leverage diffusion priors, $\\mathrm{D}^{\\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor views the pretrained diffusion network as an ensemble of timestep-dependent visual experts and self-supervisedly aggregates their heterogeneous priors into a single, clean, and complete geometric prior. Meanwhile, we utilize task-specific supervision to seamlessly adapt this noise-free prior to dense prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on various dense prediction tasks demonstrate that $\\mathrm{D}^{\\mathrm{3}}$-Predictor achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios. In addition, it requires less than half the training data previously used and efficiently performs inference in a single step.

        "summary": "Complex biological networks are fundamental to biomedical science, capturing interactions among molecules, cells, genes, and tissues. Deciphering these networks is critical for understanding health and disease, yet their scale and complexity represent a daunting challenge for current computational methods. Traditional biological network analysis methods, including deep learning approaches, while powerful, face inherent challenges such as limited scalability, oversmoothing long-range dependencies, difficulty in multimodal integration, expressivity bounds, and poor interpretability. We present Graph2Image, a framework that transforms large biological networks into sets of two-dimensional images by spatially arranging representative network nodes on a 2D grid. This transformation decouples the nodes as images, enabling the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with global receptive fields and multi-scale pyramids, thus overcoming limitations of existing biological network analysis methods in scalability, memory efficiency, and long-range context capture. Graph2Image also facilitates seamless integration with other imaging and omics modalities and enhances interpretability through direct visualization of node-associated images. When applied to several large-scale biological network datasets, Graph2Image improved classification accuracy by up to 67.2% over existing methods and provided interpretable visualizations that revealed biologically coherent patterns. It also allows analysis of very large biological networks (nodes > 1 billion) on a personal computer. Graph2Image thus provides a scalable, interpretable, and multimodal-ready approach for biological network analysis, offering new opportunities for disease diagnosis and the study of complex biological systems.",

        "title": "Evaluating and Preserving High-level Fidelity in Super-Resolution",
        "summary": "Recent image Super-Resolution (SR) models are achieving impressive effects in reconstructing details and delivering visually pleasant outputs. However, the overpowering generative ability can sometimes hallucinate and thus change the image content despite gaining high visual quality. This type of high-level change can be easily identified by humans yet not well-studied in existing low-level image quality metrics. In this paper, we establish the importance of measuring high-level fidelity for SR models as a complementary criterion to reveal the reliability of generative SR models. We construct the first annotated dataset with fidelity scores from different SR models, and evaluate how state-of-the-art (SOTA) SR models actually perform in preserving high-level fidelity. Based on the dataset, we then analyze how existing image quality metrics correlate with fidelity measurement, and further show that this high-level task can be better addressed by foundation models. Finally, by fine-tuning SR models based on our fidelity feedback, we show that both semantic fidelity and perceptual quality can be improved, demonstrating the potential value of our proposed criteria, both in model evaluation and optimization. We will release the dataset, code, and models upon acceptance.",

        "summary": "Glass is a prevalent material among solid objects in everyday life, yet segmentation methods struggle to distinguish it from opaque materials due to its transparency and reflection. While it is known that human perception relies on boundary and reflective-object features to distinguish glass objects, the existing literature has not yet sufficiently captured both properties when handling transparent objects. Hence, we propose incorporating both of these powerful visual cues via the Boundary Feature Enhancement and Reflection Feature Enhancement modules in a mutually beneficial way. Our proposed framework, TransCues, is a pyramidal transformer encoder-decoder architecture to segment transparent objects. We empirically show that these two modules can be used together effectively, improving overall performance across various benchmark datasets, including glass object semantic segmentation, mirror object semantic segmentation, and generic segmentation datasets. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin, achieving +4.2% mIoU on Trans10K-v2, +5.6% mIoU on MSD, +10.1% mIoU on RGBD-Mirror, +13.1% mIoU on TROSD, and +8.3% mIoU on Stanford2D3D, showing the effectiveness of our method against glass objects.",

        "summary": "Currently, there is a noticeable lack of AI in the medical field to support doctors in treating heterogenous brain tumors such as Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM), the deadliest human cancer in the world with a five-year survival rate of just 5.1%. This project develops an AI system offering the only end-to-end solution by aiding doctors with both diagnosis and treatment planning. In the diagnosis phase, a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 classification models (Convolutional Neural Networks and Support Vector Machine) are used. Each model progressively classifies the patient's brain into increasingly specific categories, with the final step being named diagnosis. For treatment planning, an RL system consisting of 3 generative models is used. First, the resection model (diffusion model) analyzes the diagnosed GBM MRI and predicts a possible resection outcome. Second, the radiotherapy model (Spatio-Temporal Vision Transformer) generates an MRI of the brain's progression after a user-defined number of weeks. Third, the chemotherapy model (Diffusion Model) produces the post-treatment MRI. A survival rate calculator (Convolutional Neural Network) then checks if the generated post treatment MRI has a survival rate within 15% of the user defined target. If not, a feedback loop using proximal policy optimization iterates over this system until an optimal resection location is identified. When compared to existing solutions, this project found 3 key findings: (1) Using a sequential decision-making framework consisting of 4 small diagnostic models reduced computing costs by 22.28x, (2) Transformers regression capabilities decreased tumor progression inference time by 113 hours, and (3) Applying Augmentations resembling Real-life situations improved overall DICE scores by 2.9%. These results project to increase survival rates by 0.9%, potentially saving approximately 2,250 lives.",

        "summary": "This paper proposes a novel self-supervised learning method for semantic segmentation using selective masking image reconstruction as the pretraining task. Our proposed method replaces the random masking augmentation used in most masked image modelling pretraining methods. The proposed selective masking method selectively masks image patches with the highest reconstruction loss by breaking the image reconstruction pretraining into iterative steps to leverage the trained model's knowledge. We show on two general datasets (Pascal VOC and Cityscapes) and two weed segmentation datasets (Nassar 2020 and Sugarbeets 2016) that our proposed selective masking method outperforms the traditional random masking method and supervised ImageNet pretraining on downstream segmentation accuracy by 2.9% for general datasets and 2.5% for weed segmentation datasets. Furthermore, we found that our selective masking method significantly improves accuracy for the lowest-performing classes. Lastly, we show that using the same pretraining and downstream dataset yields the best result for low-budget self-supervised pretraining. Our proposed Selective Masking Image Reconstruction method provides an effective and practical solution to improve end-to-end semantic segmentation workflows, especially for scenarios that require limited model capacity to meet inference speed and computational resource requirements.",

        "summary": "Generalization in robot manipulation is essential for deploying robots in open-world environments and advancing toward artificial general intelligence. While recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage large pre-trained understanding models for perception and instruction following, their ability to generalize to novel tasks, objects, and settings remains limited. In this work, we present VideoVLA, a simple approach that explores the potential of transforming large video generation models into robotic VLA manipulators. Given a language instruction and an image, VideoVLA predicts an action sequence as well as the future visual outcomes. Built on a multi-modal Diffusion Transformer, VideoVLA jointly models video, language, and action modalities, using pre-trained video generative models for joint visual and action forecasting. Our experiments show that high-quality imagined futures correlate with reliable action predictions and task success, highlighting the importance of visual imagination in manipulation. VideoVLA demonstrates strong generalization, including imitating other embodiments' skills and handling novel objects. This dual-prediction strategy - forecasting both actions and their visual consequences - explores a paradigm shift in robot learning and unlocks generalization capabilities in manipulation systems.",

        "title": "Can We Go Beyond Visual Features? Neural Tissue Relation Modeling for Relational Graph Analysis in Non-Melanoma Skin Histology",
        "summary": "Histopathology image segmentation is essential for delineating tissue structures in skin cancer diagnostics, but modeling spatial context and inter-tissue relationships remains a challenge, especially in regions with overlapping or morphologically similar tissues. Current convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches operate primarily on visual texture, often treating tissues as independent regions and failing to encode biological context. To this end, we introduce Neural Tissue Relation Modeling (NTRM), a novel segmentation framework that augments CNNs with a tissue-level graph neural network to model spatial and functional relationships across tissue types. NTRM constructs a graph over predicted regions, propagates contextual information via message passing, and refines segmentation through spatial projection. Unlike prior methods, NTRM explicitly encodes inter-tissue dependencies, enabling structurally coherent predictions in boundary-dense zones. On the benchmark Histopathology Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Segmentation Dataset, NTRM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a robust Dice similarity coefficient that is 4.9\\% to 31.25\\% higher than the best-performing models among the evaluated approaches. Our experiments indicate that relational modeling offers a principled path toward more context-aware and interpretable histological segmentation, compared to local receptive-field architectures that lack tissue-level structural awareness.
