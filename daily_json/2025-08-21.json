        "summary": "Existing text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in generating high-quality images guided by textual prompts.\nHowever, achieving multi-subject compositional synthesis with precise spatial\ncontrol remains a significant challenge. In this work, we address the task of\nlayout-controllable multi-subject synthesis (LMS), which requires both faithful\nreconstruction of reference subjects and their accurate placement in specified\nregions within a unified image. While recent advancements have separately\nimproved layout control and subject synthesis, existing approaches struggle to\nsimultaneously satisfy the dual requirements of spatial precision and identity\npreservation in this composite task. To bridge this gap, we propose MUSE, a\nunified synthesis framework that employs concatenated cross-attention (CCA) to\nseamlessly integrate layout specifications with textual guidance through\nexplicit semantic space expansion. The proposed CCA mechanism enables\nbidirectional modality alignment between spatial constraints and textual\ndescriptions without interference. Furthermore, we design a progressive\ntwo-stage training strategy that decomposes the LMS task into learnable\nsub-objectives for effective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat MUSE achieves zero-shot end-to-end generation with superior spatial\naccuracy and identity consistency compared to existing solutions, advancing the\nfrontier of controllable image synthesis.

        "summary": "Despite the success of large language models (LLMs) in various domains, their\npotential in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) remains largely underexplored\ndue to two critical barriers: (1) the scarcity of high-quality TCM data and (2)\nthe inherently multimodal nature of TCM diagnostics, which involve looking,\nlistening, smelling, and pulse-taking. These sensory-rich modalities are beyond\nthe scope of conventional LLMs. To address these challenges, we present\nShizhenGPT, the first multimodal LLM tailored for TCM. To overcome data\nscarcity, we curate the largest TCM dataset to date, comprising 100GB+ of text\nand 200GB+ of multimodal data, including 1.2M images, 200 hours of audio, and\nphysiological signals. ShizhenGPT is pretrained and instruction-tuned to\nachieve deep TCM knowledge and multimodal reasoning. For evaluation, we collect\nrecent national TCM qualification exams and build a visual benchmark for\nMedicinal Recognition and Visual Diagnosis. Experiments demonstrate that\nShizhenGPT outperforms comparable-scale LLMs and competes with larger\nproprietary models. Moreover, it leads in TCM visual understanding among\nexisting multimodal LLMs and demonstrates unified perception across modalities\nlike sound, pulse, smell, and vision, paving the way toward holistic multimodal\nperception and diagnosis in TCM. Datasets, models, and code are publicly\navailable. We hope this work will inspire further exploration in this field.",

However, conventional\nfine-tuning of such controllable pipelines frequently suffers from distribution\ndrift due to limitations in imperfect multimodal alignment, resulting in\ncompromised texture realism and temporal coherence. To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose a concept distillation training strategy that utilizes the\npretrained T2V model to synthesize training samples with embedded textual\nconcepts, thereby distilling its conceptual understanding to preserve texture\nand temporal quality. To enhance generation controllability, we redesign the\ncontrol architecture with two key components: 1) a control feature projector\nthat filters degradation artifacts from input video latents to minimize their\npropagation through the generation pipeline, and 2) a new ControlNet connector\nemploying a dual-branch design. This connector synergistically combines\nMLP-based feature mapping with cross-attention mechanism for dynamic control\nfeature retrieval, enabling both content preservation and adaptive control\nsignal modulation. Extensive experiments show that Vivid-VR performs favorably\nagainst existing approaches on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, as\nwell as AIGC videos, achieving impressive texture realism, visual vividness,\nand temporal consistency.

        "summary": "Video generation has recently shown superiority in urban scene synthesis for\nautonomous driving. Existing video generation approaches to autonomous driving\nprimarily focus on RGB video generation and lack the ability to support\nmulti-modal video generation. However, multi-modal data, such as depth maps and\nsemantic maps, are crucial for holistic urban scene understanding in autonomous\ndriving. Although it is feasible to use multiple models to generate different\nmodalities, this increases the difficulty of model deployment and does not\nleverage complementary cues for multi-modal data generation. To address this\nproblem, in this work, we propose a novel multi-modal multi-view video\ngeneration approach to autonomous driving. Specifically, we construct a unified\ndiffusion transformer model composed of modal-shared components and\nmodal-specific components. Then, we leverage diverse conditioning inputs to\nencode controllable scene structure and content cues into the unified diffusion\nmodel for multi-modal multi-view video generation. In this way, our approach is\ncapable of generating multi-modal multi-view driving scene videos in a unified\nframework.

        "summary": "We introduce Tinker, a versatile framework for high-fidelity 3D editing that\noperates in both one-shot and few-shot regimes without any per-scene\nfinetuning. Unlike prior techniques that demand extensive per-scene\noptimization to ensure multi-view consistency or to produce dozens of\nconsistent edited input views, Tinker delivers robust, multi-view consistent\nedits from as few as one or two images. This capability stems from repurposing\npretrained diffusion models, which unlocks their latent 3D awareness. To drive\nresearch in this space, we curate the first large-scale multi-view editing\ndataset and data pipeline, spanning diverse scenes and styles. Building on this\ndataset, we develop our framework capable of generating multi-view consistent\nedited views without per-scene training, which consists of two novel\ncomponents: (1) Referring multi-view editor: Enables precise, reference-driven\nedits that remain coherent across all viewpoints. (2) Any-view-to-video\nsynthesizer: Leverages spatial-temporal priors from video diffusion to perform\nhigh-quality scene completion and novel-view generation even from sparse\ninputs. Through extensive experiments, Tinker significantly reduces the barrier\nto generalizable 3D content creation, achieving state-of-the-art performance on\nediting, novel-view synthesis, and rendering enhancement tasks.

State-of-the-art deblurring methods for\nextreme blur, such as ExBluRF, as well as Gaussian Splatting-based approaches\nlike Deblur-GS, typically assume access to sharp images for camera pose\nestimation and point cloud generation, an unrealistic assumption. Methods\nrelying on COLMAP initialization, such as BAD-Gaussians, also fail due to\nunreliable feature correspondences under severe blur. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GeMS, a 3DGS framework that reconstructs scenes directly\nfrom extremely blurred images. GeMS integrates: (1) VGGSfM, a deep\nlearning-based Structure-from-Motion pipeline that estimates poses and\ngenerates point clouds directly from blurred inputs; (2) 3DGS-MCMC, which\nenables robust scene initialization by treating Gaussians as samples from a\nprobability distribution, eliminating heuristic densification and pruning; and\n(3) joint optimization of camera trajectories and Gaussian parameters for\nstable reconstruction. While this pipeline produces strong results,\ninaccuracies may remain when all inputs are severely blurred. To mitigate this,\nwe propose GeMS-E, which integrates a progressive refinement step using events:\n(4) Event-based Double Integral (EDI) deblurring restores sharper images that\nare then fed into GeMS, improving pose estimation, point cloud generation, and\noverall reconstruction.

This encourages the model to learn structural invariances and capture\ndiverse anatomical cues, resulting in more expressive and generalizable\nfeatures. To support this, we adapt the ST-GCN architecture to handle skeletons\nwith varying joint layouts and scales through a unified representation scheme.\nExperiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 datasets demonstrate that MS-CLR\nconsistently improves performance over strong single-skeleton contrastive\nlearning baselines.

        "summary": "Reconstructing 3D objects into editable programs is pivotal for applications\nlike reverse engineering and shape editing. However, existing methods often\nrely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,\nrestricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that\nreconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python\nscripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs\ncapable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we\nconstruct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each\nobject is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a\nmultimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into\nexecutable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior\nperformance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates\nintuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code\nmodifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these\ncontributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for\nprogrammatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding.",

Motivated by the way quantum squeezed states\nredistribute uncertainty according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, we\nintroduce Squeezed Diffusion Models (SDM), which scale noise anisotropically\nalong the principal component of the training distribution. As squeezing\nenhances the signal-to-noise ratio in physics, we hypothesize that scaling\nnoise in a data-dependent manner can better assist diffusion models in learning\nimportant data features. We study two configurations: (i) a Heisenberg\ndiffusion model that compensates the scaling on the principal axis with inverse\nscaling on orthogonal directions and (ii) a standard SDM variant that scales\nonly the principal axis. Counterintuitively, on CIFAR-10/100 and CelebA-64,\nmild antisqueezing - i.e. increasing variance on the principal axis -\nconsistently improves FID by up to 15% and shifts the precision-recall frontier\ntoward higher recall.

This makes\nthem less effective for practical lighting stylization requirements, especially\nin the challenging task of transferring complex light effects from a reference\nimage to a user-specified target image. To address this problem, we propose\nTransLight, a novel framework that enables high-fidelity and high-freedom\ntransfer of light effects. Extracting the light effect from the reference image\nis the most critical and challenging step in our method. The difficulty lies in\nthe complex geometric structure features embedded in light effects that are\nhighly coupled with content in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, we first\npresent Generative Decoupling, where two fine-tuned diffusion models are used\nto accurately separate image content and light effects, generating a newly\ncurated, million-scale dataset of image-content-light triplets. Then, we employ\nIC-Light as the generative model and train our model with our triplets,\ninjecting the reference lighting image as an additional conditioning signal.\nThe resulting TransLight model enables customized and natural transfer of\ndiverse light effects. Notably, by thoroughly disentangling light effects from\nreference images, our generative decoupling strategy endows TransLight with\nhighly flexible illumination control.

However, existing\nmethods rely on large-scale pre-training to improve video retrieval\nperformance, resulting in significant computational demands. Additionally, the\nfine-grained information in videos and texts remains underexplored. To\nalleviate these problems, we propose a novel framework to learn fine-grained\nfeatures for better alignment and introduce an inference pipeline to improve\nperformance without additional training. Specifically, we employ coarse-to-fine\nobjectives to understand the semantic information of video-text pairs,\nincluding contrastive and matching learning. The fine-grained data used for\ntraining is obtained through the Granularity-Aware Representation module, which\nis designed based on similarity analysis between video frames and words in\ncaptions. Furthermore, we observe that the repetition of keywords in the\noriginal captions, referred to as \"Repetition\", can enhance retrieval\nperformance and improve alignment between video and text. Based on this\ninsight, we propose a novel and effective inference pipeline that incorporates\na voting mechanism and a new Matching Entropy metric to achieve better\nretrieval performance without requiring additional pre-training. Experimental\nresults on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms\nprevious approaches.

The proposed technique addresses the\nlimitations of relying purely on AIS for location information, caused by issues\nlike equipment reliability, data manipulation, and transmission delays. By\ncombining vessel detections from monocular RGB images, obtained using an object\ndetection network (YOLOX-X), with AIS messages, the technique generates 3D\nbounding boxes that represent the vessels' 6D poses, i.e. spatial and\nrotational dimensions. The paper evaluates different object detection models to\nlocate vessels in image space. We also compare two transformation methods\n(homography and Perspective-n-Point) for aligning AIS data with image\ncoordinates. The results of our work demonstrate that the Perspective-n-Point\n(PnP) method achieves a significantly lower projection error compared to\nhomography-based approaches used before, and the YOLOX-X model achieves a mean\nAverage Precision (mAP) of 0.80 at an Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold\nof 0.5 for relevant vessel classes. We show indication that our approach allows\nthe creation of a 6D pose estimation dataset without needing manual annotation.\nAdditionally, we introduce the Boats on Nordelbe Kehrwieder (BONK-pose), a\npublicly available dataset comprising 3753 images with 3D bounding box\nannotations for pose estimation, created by our data fusion approach.

These methods require training on vast amounts of data\nusually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most\ninstitutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other\nhand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific\ndata, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is\ntransferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly\nvaluable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the\ndevelopment of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we presents a new\nmodel-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and\npreservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a\nshared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by\ntheir distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation\nstrategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating\nknowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module.\nBy unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit\nteachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data.\nOur model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently\nsupports multiple downstream tasks.

        "title": "Virtual Multiplex Staining for Histological Images using a Marker-wise Conditioned Diffusion Model",
        "summary": "Multiplex imaging is revolutionizing pathology by enabling the simultaneous\nvisualization of multiple biomarkers within tissue samples, providing\nmolecular-level insights that traditional hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining\ncannot provide. However, the complexity and cost of multiplex data acquisition\nhave hindered its widespread adoption. Additionally, most existing large\nrepositories of H&E images lack corresponding multiplex images, limiting\nopportunities for multimodal analysis. To address these challenges, we leverage\nrecent advances in latent diffusion models (LDMs), which excel at modeling\ncomplex data distributions utilizing their powerful priors for fine-tuning to a\ntarget domain. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for virtual\nmultiplex staining that utilizes pretrained LDM parameters to generate\nmultiplex images from H&E images using a conditional diffusion model. Our\napproach enables marker-by-marker generation by conditioning the diffusion\nmodel on each marker, while sharing the same architecture across all markers.\nTo tackle the challenge of varying pixel value distributions across different\nmarker stains and to improve inference speed, we fine-tune the model for\nsingle-step sampling, enhancing both color contrast fidelity and inference\nefficiency through pixel-level loss functions. We validate our framework on two\npublicly available datasets, notably demonstrating its effectiveness in\ngenerating up to 18 different marker types with improved accuracy, a\nsubstantial increase over the 2-3 marker types achieved in previous approaches.\nThis validation highlights the potential of our framework, pioneering virtual\nmultiplex staining. Finally, this paper bridges the gap between H&E and\nmultiplex imaging, potentially enabling retrospective studies and large-scale\nanalyses of existing H&E image repositories.",

As obtaining dense concept annotations with human labeling is\ndemanding and costly, recent approaches utilize foundation models to determine\nthe concepts existing in the images. However, such label-free CBMs often fail\nto localize concepts in relevant regions, attending to visually unrelated\nregions when predicting concept presence. To this end, we propose a framework,\ncoined Locality-aware Concept Bottleneck Model (LCBM), which utilizes rich\ninformation from foundation models and adopts prototype learning to ensure\naccurate spatial localization of the concepts. Specifically, we assign one\nprototype to each concept, promoted to represent a prototypical image feature\nof that concept.

Statistical and data-driven\napproaches remain the standard in industrial anomaly detection, yet their\nadaptability and usability are constrained by the dependence on extensive\nannotated datasets and limited flexibility under dynamic production conditions.\nRecent advances in the perception capabilities of foundation models provide\npromising opportunities for their adaptation to this downstream task. This\npaper presents PB-IAD (Prompt-based Industrial Anomaly Detection), a novel\nframework that leverages the multimodal and reasoning capabilities of\nfoundation models for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, PB-IAD\naddresses three key requirements of dynamic production environments: data\nsparsity, agile adaptability, and domain user centricity. In addition to the\nanomaly detection, the framework includes a prompt template that is\nspecifically designed for iteratively implementing domain-specific process\nknowledge, as well as a pre-processing module that translates domain user\ninputs into effective system prompts. This user-centric design allows domain\nexperts to customise the system flexibly without requiring data science\nexpertise. The proposed framework is evaluated by utilizing GPT-4.1 across\nthree distinct manufacturing scenarios, two data modalities, and an ablation\nstudy to systematically assess the contribution of semantic instructions.\nFurthermore, PB-IAD is benchmarked to state-of-the-art methods for anomaly\ndetection such as PatchCore.

        "summary": "A key challenge in 3D talking head synthesis lies in the reliance on a\nlong-duration talking head video to train a new model for each target identity\nfrom scratch. Recent methods have attempted to address this issue by extracting\ngeneral features from audio through pre-training models. However, since audio\ncontains information irrelevant to lip motion, existing approaches typically\nstruggle to map the given audio to realistic lip behaviors in the target face\nwhen trained on only a few frames, causing poor lip synchronization and talking\nhead image quality. This paper proposes D^3-Talker, a novel approach that\nconstructs a static 3D Gaussian attribute field and employs audio and Facial\nMotion signals to independently control two distinct Gaussian attribute\ndeformation fields, effectively decoupling the predictions of general and\npersonalized deformations. We design a novel similarity contrastive loss\nfunction during pre-training to achieve more thorough decoupling. Furthermore,\nwe integrate a Coarse-to-Fine module to refine the rendered images, alleviating\nblurriness caused by head movements and enhancing overall image quality.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that D^3-Talker outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in both high-fidelity rendering and accurate audio-lip synchronization\nwith limited training data. Our code will be provided upon acceptance.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in portable imaging have made camera-based screen capture\nubiquitous. Unfortunately, frequency aliasing between the camera's color filter\narray (CFA) and the display's sub-pixels induces moir\\'e patterns that severely\ndegrade captured photos and videos. Although various demoir\\'eing models have\nbeen proposed to remove such moir\\'e patterns, these approaches still suffer\nfrom several limitations: (i) spatially varying artifact strength within a\nframe, (ii) large-scale and globally spreading structures, (iii)\nchannel-dependent statistics and (iv) rapid temporal fluctuations across\nframes. We address these issues with the Moir\\'e Conditioned Hybrid Adaptive\nTransformer (MoCHA-former), which comprises two key components: Decoupled\nMoir\\'e Adaptive Demoir\\'eing (DMAD) and Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Demoir\\'eing\n(STAD). DMAD separates moir\\'e and content via a Moir\\'e Decoupling Block (MDB)\nand a Detail Decoupling Block (DDB), then produces moir\\'e-adaptive features\nusing a Moir\\'e Conditioning Block (MCB) for targeted restoration. STAD\nintroduces a Spatial Fusion Block (SFB) with window attention to capture\nlarge-scale structures, and a Feature Channel Attention (FCA) to model channel\ndependence in RAW frames. To ensure temporal consistency, MoCHA-former performs\nimplicit frame alignment without any explicit alignment module. We analyze\nmoir\\'e characteristics through qualitative and quantitative studies, and\nevaluate on two video datasets covering RAW and sRGB domains. MoCHA-former\nconsistently surpasses prior methods across PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS.",

Display-camera imaging systems offer unique advantages for this task:\neach pixel can easily function as a programmable point light source, and the\npolarized light emitted by LCD displays facilitates diffuse-specular\nseparation. Despite these benefits, there is currently no public real-world\ndataset captured using display-camera systems, unlike other setups such as\nlight stages. This absence hinders the development and evaluation of\ndisplay-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first\nreal-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we\nconstruct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo\npolarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse\ngeometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We\nalso provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the\nsynthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different\nnoise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing\nphotometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet\neffective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art inverse rendering methods.

An adaptation method\nfits the Chinese text inputs to Flux, a powerful text-to-image (TTI) generative\nmodel initially trained on the English corpus. Despite the notable image\ngeneration ability conditioned on English text inputs, Flux performs poorly\nwhen processing non-English prompts, particularly due to linguistic and\ncultural biases inherent in predominantly English-centric training datasets.\nExisting approaches, such as translating non-English prompts into English or\nfinetuning models for bilingual mappings, inadequately address culturally\nspecific semantics, compromising image authenticity and quality. To address\nthis issue, we introduce a novel method to bridge Chinese semantic\nunderstanding with compatibility in English-centric TTI model communities.\nExisting approaches relying on ControlNet-like architectures typically require\na massive parameter scale and lack direct control over Chinese semantics. In\ncomparison, CTA-flux leverages MultiModal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) to\ncontrol the Flux backbone directly, significantly reducing the number of\nparameters while enhancing the model's understanding of Chinese semantics. This\nintegration significantly improves the generation quality and cultural\nauthenticity without extensive retraining of the entire model, thus maintaining\ncompatibility with existing text-to-image plugins such as LoRA, IP-Adapter, and\nControlNet.

However, the increasing\nresolution of ST, particularly with platforms such as Visium HD achieving 8um\nor finer, introduces significant computational and modeling challenges.\nConventional spot-by-spot sequential regression frameworks become inefficient\nand unstable at this scale, while the inherent extreme sparsity and low\nexpression levels of high-resolution ST further complicate both prediction and\nevaluation. To address these limitations, we propose Img2ST-Net, a novel\nhistology-to-ST generation framework for efficient and parallel high-resolution\nST prediction. Unlike conventional spot-by-spot inference methods, Img2ST-Net\nemploys a fully convolutional architecture to generate dense, HD gene\nexpression maps in a parallelized manner. By modeling HD ST data as super-pixel\nrepresentations, the task is reformulated from image-to-omics inference into a\nsuper-content image generation problem with hundreds or thousands of output\nchannels. This design not only improves computational efficiency but also\nbetter preserves the spatial organization intrinsic to spatial omics data. To\nenhance robustness under sparse expression patterns, we further introduce\nSSIM-ST, a structural-similarity-based evaluation metric tailored for\nhigh-resolution ST analysis. We present a scalable, biologically coherent\nframework for high-resolution ST prediction. Img2ST-Net offers a principled\nsolution for efficient and accurate ST inference at scale. Our contributions\nlay the groundwork for next-generation ST modeling that is robust and\nresolution-aware.

While these methods achieve\nfast reconstruction,concerns remain regarding quantitative accuracy and the\npresence of artifacts,stemming from limited model interpretability,data driven\ndependence, and overfitting risks.These challenges have hindered clinical\nadoption.To address them,we propose a conditional diffusion model with\nposterior physical correction (PET-DPC) for PET image reconstruction. An\ninnovative normalization procedure generates the input Geometric TOF\nProbabilistic Image (GTP-image),while physical information is incorporated\nduring the diffusion sampling process to perform posterior\nscatter,attenuation,and random corrections. The model was trained and validated\non 300 brain and 50 whole-body PET datasets,a physical phantom,and 20 simulated\nbrain datasets. PET-DPC produced reconstructions closely aligned with fully\ncorrected OSEM images,outperforming end-to-end deep learning models in\nquantitative metrics and,in some cases, surpassing traditional iterative\nmethods. The model also generalized well to out-of-distribution(OOD) data.\nCompared to iterative methods,PET-DPC reduced reconstruction time by 50% for\nbrain scans and 85% for whole-body scans. Ablation studies confirmed the\ncritical role of posterior correction in implementing scatter and attenuation\ncorrections,enhancing reconstruction accuracy.

        "summary": "Talking face generation is a novel and challenging generation task, aiming at\nsynthesizing a vivid speaking-face video given a specific audio. To fulfill\nemotion-controllable talking face generation, current methods need to overcome\ntwo challenges: One is how to effectively model the multimodal relationship\nrelated to the specific emotion, and the other is how to leverage this\nrelationship to synthesize identity preserving emotional videos. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel method to tackle the emotion-controllable talking face\ngeneration task discretely. Specifically, we employ two pre-training strategies\nto disentangle audio into independent components and quantize videos into\ncombinations of visual tokens. Subsequently, we propose the emotion-anchor (EA)\nrepresentation that integrates the emotional information into visual tokens.\nFinally, we introduce an autoregressive transformer to model the global\ndistribution of the visual tokens under the given conditions and further\npredict the index sequence for synthesizing the manipulated videos. We conduct\nexperiments on the MEAD dataset that controls the emotion of videos conditioned\non multiple emotional audios. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\nsuperiorities of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

        "summary": "Explainable object recognition using vision-language models such as CLIP\ninvolves predicting accurate category labels supported by rationales that\njustify the decision-making process. Existing methods typically rely on\nprompt-based conditioning, which suffers from limitations in CLIP's text\nencoder and provides weak conditioning on explanatory structures. Additionally,\nprior datasets are often restricted to single, and frequently noisy, rationales\nthat fail to capture the full diversity of discriminative image features. In\nthis work, we introduce a multi-rationale explainable object recognition\nbenchmark comprising datasets in which each image is annotated with multiple\nground-truth rationales, along with evaluation metrics designed to offer a more\ncomprehensive representation of the task. To overcome the limitations of\nprevious approaches, we propose a contrastive conditional inference (CCI)\nframework that explicitly models the probabilistic relationships among image\nembeddings, category labels, and rationales. Without requiring any training,\nour framework enables more effective conditioning on rationales to predict\naccurate object categories. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on\nthe multi-rationale explainable object recognition benchmark, including strong\nzero-shot performance, and sets a new standard for both classification accuracy\nand rationale quality. Together with the benchmark, this work provides a more\ncomplete framework for evaluating future models in explainable object\nrecognition. The code will be made available online.",

While\nmodels achieve high accuracy, their clinical utility is limited by a lack of\nrobust uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction (CP) offers a\ndistribution-free framework to generate prediction sets with statistical\nguarantees of coverage. However, the interaction between standard training\npractices like data augmentation and the validity of these guarantees is not\nwell understood. In this study, we systematically investigate how different\ndata augmentation strategies affect the performance of conformal predictors for\nDR grading. Using the DDR dataset, we evaluate two backbone architectures --\nResNet-50 and a Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Transformer (CoaT) -- trained under\nfive augmentation regimes: no augmentation, standard geometric transforms,\nCLAHE, Mixup, and CutMix. We analyze the downstream effects on conformal\nmetrics, including empirical coverage, average prediction set size, and correct\nefficiency. Our results demonstrate that sample-mixing strategies like Mixup\nand CutMix not only improve predictive accuracy but also yield more reliable\nand efficient uncertainty estimates. Conversely, methods like CLAHE can\nnegatively impact model certainty.

        "summary": "Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision,\nand detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in\nvision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP\nmodel can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues\nfound in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages\nCLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on\na hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection\nsymmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel\nprompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which\naggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate\nthe semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection\ndatasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations\nverifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant\ndecoder, and the SAPG technique.

We introduce a unified representation\nthat jointly models geometry and motion using articulated 3D Gaussians. This\nformulation improves robustness in motion decomposition and supports\narticulated objects with up to 20 parts, significantly outperforming prior\napproaches that often struggle beyond 2--3 parts due to brittle initialization.\nTo systematically assess scalability and generalization, we propose MPArt-90, a\nnew benchmark consisting of 90 articulated objects across 20 categories, each\nwith diverse part counts and motion configurations. Extensive experiments show\nthat our method consistently achieves superior accuracy in part-level geometry\nreconstruction and motion estimation across a broad range of object types.

        "summary": "Purpose: Understanding how the pancreas changes is critical for detecting\ndeviations in type 2 diabetes and other pancreatic disease. We measure pancreas\nsize and shape using morphological measurements from ages 0 to 90. Our goals\nare to 1) identify reliable clinical imaging modalities for AI-based pancreas\nmeasurement, 2) establish normative morphological aging trends, and 3) detect\npotential deviations in type 2 diabetes.\n  Approach: We analyzed a clinically acquired dataset of 2533 patients imaged\nwith abdominal CT or MRI. We resampled the scans to 3mm isotropic resolution,\nsegmented the pancreas using automated methods, and extracted 13 morphological\npancreas features across the lifespan. First, we assessed CT and MRI\nmeasurements to determine which modalities provide consistent lifespan trends.\nSecond, we characterized distributions of normative morphological patterns\nstratified by age group and sex. Third, we used GAMLSS regression to model\npancreas morphology trends in 1350 patients matched for age, sex, and type 2\ndiabetes status to identify any deviations from normative aging associated with\ntype 2 diabetes.\n  Results: When adjusting for confounders, the aging trends for 10 of 13\nmorphological features were significantly different between patients with type\n2 diabetes and non-diabetic controls (p < 0.05 after multiple comparisons\ncorrections). Additionally, MRI appeared to yield different pancreas\nmeasurements than CT using our AI-based method.\n  Conclusions: We provide lifespan trends demonstrating that the size and shape\nof the pancreas is altered in type 2 diabetes using 675 control patients and\n675 diabetes patients. Moreover, our findings reinforce that the pancreas is\nsmaller in type 2 diabetes. Additionally, we contribute a reference of lifespan\npancreas morphology from a large cohort of non-diabetic control patients in a\nclinical setting.",

The quantitative analysis of data significantly contributes to\nmodel training, enhancing both the efficiency and quality of data utilization.\nHowever, existing data analysis tools often lag in accuracy. For instance, many\nof these tools even assume that the loss function of neural networks is convex.\nThese limitations make it challenging to implement current methods effectively.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new formulation to approximate a sample's\ninfluence by accumulating the differences in influence between consecutive\nlearning steps, which we term Diff-In. Specifically, we formulate the\nsample-wise influence as the cumulative sum of its changes/differences across\nsuccessive training iterations. By employing second-order approximations, we\napproximate these difference terms with high accuracy while eliminating the\nneed for model convexity required by existing methods. Despite being a\nsecond-order method, Diff-In maintains computational complexity comparable to\nthat of first-order methods and remains scalable. This efficiency is achieved\nby computing the product of the Hessian and gradient, which can be efficiently\napproximated using finite differences of first-order gradients. We assess the\napproximation accuracy of Diff-In both theoretically and empirically. Our\ntheoretical analysis demonstrates that Diff-In achieves significantly lower\napproximation error compared to existing influence estimators. Extensive\nexperiments further confirm its superior performance across multiple benchmark\ndatasets in three data-centric tasks: data cleaning, data deletion, and coreset\nselection.

However,\nbalancing the tradeoff between preserving knowledge and adapting to domain\nshifts remains challenging for model adaptation methods, since adapting to\ndomain shifts can induce forgetting of task-relevant knowledge. To address this\nproblem, we propose FOCUS, a novel frequency-based conditioning approach within\na diffusion-driven input-adaptation framework. Utilising learned, spatially\nadaptive frequency priors, our approach conditions the reverse steps during\ndiffusion-driven denoising to preserve task-relevant semantic information for\ndense prediction.\n  FOCUS leverages a trained, lightweight, Y-shaped Frequency Prediction Network\n(Y-FPN) that disentangles high and low frequency information from noisy images.\nThis minimizes the computational costs involved in implementing our approach in\na diffusion-driven framework.

        "summary": "Fire outbreaks pose critical threats to human life and infrastructure,\nnecessitating high-fidelity early-warning systems that detect combustion\nprecursors such as smoke. However, smoke plumes exhibit complex spatiotemporal\ndynamics influenced by illumination variability, flow kinematics, and\nenvironmental noise, undermining the reliability of traditional detectors. To\naddress these challenges without the logistical complexity of multi-sensor\narrays, we propose an information-fusion framework by integrating smoke feature\nrepresentations extracted from monocular imagery. Specifically, a Two-Phase\nUncertainty-Aware Shifted Windows Transformer for robust and reliable smoke\ndetection, leveraging a novel smoke segmentation dataset, constructed via\noptical flow-based motion encoding, is proposed. The optical flow estimation is\nperformed with a four-color-theorem-inspired dual-phase level-set\nfractional-order variational model, which preserves motion discontinuities. The\nresulting color-encoded optical flow maps are fused with appearance cues via a\nGaussian Mixture Model to generate binary segmentation masks of the smoke\nregions. These fused representations are fed into the novel Shifted-Windows\nTransformer, which is augmented with a multi-scale uncertainty estimation head\nand trained under a two-phase learning regimen. First learning phase optimizes\nsmoke detection accuracy, while during the second phase, the model learns to\nestimate plausibility confidence in its predictions by jointly modeling\naleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Extensive experiments using multiple\nevaluation metrics and comparative analysis with state-of-the-art approaches\ndemonstrate superior generalization and robustness, offering a reliable\nsolution for early fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and\nautonomous monitoring applications.",

In this work, we propose\nWISE-FUSE, an adaptive WSI encoding framework that leverages pathology-domain\nvision-language models and large language models to address this challenge by\nselectively processing diagnostically relevant regions. WISE-FUSE first\ncomputes similarity scores between low-resolution patches and class-specific\ntextual descriptions using a knowledge distillation mechanism that preserves\nfine-grained diagnostic features. Based on these similarity scores, we select a\nsmall subset of informative regions for the target task, which quickly\neliminates irrelevant patches at the coarse level. The corresponding\nhigh-resolution patches are then selectively encoded and fused with textual\nembeddings to reinforce diagnostic context. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat WISE-FUSE reduces WSI encoding time by over threefold while achieving\ndiagnostic performance comparable to or surpassing that of exhaustive patch\nprocessing, offering a scalable and practical solution for CPath.",

To address this limitation, we propose\nHRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose\nestimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud\nrepresentations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses.

However, pathology images from different\nhospitals often vary due to differences in scanning hardware and preprocessing\nstyles, which may lead PFMs to inadvertently learn hospital-specific features,\nposing risks for clinical deployment. In this work, we present the first\nsystematic study of domain bias in PFMs arising from hospital source\ncharacteristics. Specifically, we (1) construct a pipeline for quantifying\ndomain bias in PFMs, (2) evaluate and compare the performance of multiple\nmodels, and (3) propose a lightweight adversarial framework that removes latent\nhospital-specific features from frozen representations without modifying the\nencoder itself. By introducing a trainable adapter and a domain classifier\nconnected through a gradient reversal layer (GRL), our method learns\ntask-discriminative yet domain-invariant representations. Experiments on\nmulti-center histopathology datasets demonstrate that our approach\nsubstantially reduces domain predictability while maintaining or even improving\ndisease classification performance, particularly in out-of-domain (unseen\nhospital) scenarios. Further analyses, including hospital detection and feature\nspace visualization, confirm the effectiveness of our method in mitigating\nhospital bias. We will provide our code based on acceptance.",

Event cameras are\ncharacterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range,\nthat can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB\ncameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the\nchallenging task of single-shot object pose estimation.

Specifically, we propose an\nevent-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement\nan object 6-DoF velocity tracker.

        "summary": "The generation of safety-critical scenarios in simulation has become\nincreasingly crucial for safety evaluation in autonomous vehicles prior to road\ndeployment in society. However, current approaches largely rely on predefined\nthreat patterns or rule-based strategies, which limit their ability to expose\ndiverse and unforeseen failure modes. To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging. This meta-scenario is then\nspecified in executable code for precise in-simulator control. Subsequently,\nComplex Scenario Evolution uses background vehicles to amplify the core threat\nintroduced by Meta-Scenario. It builds an adversarial collaborator graph to\nidentify key agent trajectories for optimization. These perturbations are\ndesigned to simultaneously reduce the ego vehicle's maneuvering space and\ncreate critical occlusions. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple\nreinforcement learning based AV models show that ScenGE uncovers more severe\ncollision cases (+31.96%) on average than SoTA baselines. Additionally, our\nScenGE can be applied to large model based AV systems and deployed on different\nsimulators; we further observe that adversarial training on our scenarios\nimproves the model robustness. Finally, we validate our framework through\nreal-world vehicle tests and human evaluation, confirming that the generated\nscenarios are both plausible and critical. We hope our paper can build up a\ncritical step towards building public trust and ensuring their safe deployment.",

        "summary": "Accurate engagement estimation is essential for adaptive human-computer\ninteraction systems, yet robust deployment is hindered by poor generalizability\nacross diverse domains and challenges in modeling complex interaction\ndynamics.To tackle these issues, we propose DAPA (Domain-Adaptive Parallel\nAttention), a novel framework for generalizable conversational engagement\nmodeling. DAPA introduces a Domain Prompting mechanism by prepending learnable\ndomain-specific vectors to the input, explicitly conditioning the model on the\ndata's origin to facilitate domain-aware adaptation while preserving\ngeneralizable engagement representations. To capture interactional synchrony,\nthe framework also incorporates a Parallel Cross-Attention module that\nexplicitly aligns reactive (forward BiLSTM) and anticipatory (backward BiLSTM)\nstates between participants.Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAPA\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art performance on several cross-cultural and\ncross-linguistic benchmarks, notably achieving an absolute improvement of 0.45\nin Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) over a strong baseline on the\nNoXi-J test set. The superiority of our method was also confirmed by winning\nthe first place in the Multi-Domain Engagement Estimation Challenge at\nMultiMediate'25.",

        "summary": "While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has rapidly advanced, its application in\nagriculture remains underexplored. Agricultural scenes present unique\nchallenges for 3D reconstruction methods, particularly due to uneven\nillumination, occlusions, and a limited field of view. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce \\textbf{NIRPlant}, a novel multimodal dataset\nencompassing Near-Infrared (NIR) imagery, RGB imagery, textual metadata, Depth,\nand LiDAR data collected under varied indoor and outdoor lighting conditions.\nBy integrating NIR data, our approach enhances robustness and provides crucial\nbotanical insights that extend beyond the visible spectrum. Additionally, we\nleverage text-based metadata derived from vegetation indices, such as NDVI,\nNDWI, and the chlorophyll index, which significantly enriches the contextual\nunderstanding of complex agricultural environments. To fully exploit these\nmodalities, we propose \\textbf{NIRSplat}, an effective multimodal Gaussian\nsplatting architecture employing a cross-attention mechanism combined with 3D\npoint-based positional encoding, providing robust geometric priors.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that \\textbf{NIRSplat} outperforms\nexisting landmark methods, including 3DGS, CoR-GS, and InstantSplat,\nhighlighting its effectiveness in challenging agricultural scenarios.

        "summary": "Computer-aided surgical simulation is a critical component of orthognathic\nsurgical planning, where accurately simulating face-bone shape transformations\nis significant. The traditional biomechanical simulation methods are limited by\ntheir computational time consumption levels, labor-intensive data processing\nstrategies and low accuracy. Recently, deep learning-based simulation methods\nhave been proposed to view this problem as a point-to-point transformation\nbetween skeletal and facial point clouds. However, these approaches cannot\nprocess large-scale points, have limited receptive fields that lead to noisy\npoints, and employ complex preprocessing and postprocessing operations based on\nregistration. These shortcomings limit the performance and widespread\napplicability of such methods. Therefore, we propose a Transformer-based\ncoarse-to-fine point movement network (TCFNet) to learn unique, complicated\ncorrespondences at the patch and point levels for dense face-bone point cloud\ntransformations. This end-to-end framework adopts a Transformer-based network\nand a local information aggregation network (LIA-Net) in the first and second\nstages, respectively, which reinforce each other to generate precise point\nmovement paths. LIA-Net can effectively compensate for the neighborhood\nprecision loss of the Transformer-based network by modeling local geometric\nstructures (edges, orientations and relative position features). The previous\nglobal features are employed to guide the local displacement using a gated\nrecurrent unit. Inspired by deformable medical image registration, we propose\nan auxiliary loss that can utilize expert knowledge for reconstructing critical\norgans.Compared with the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on gathered\ndatasets, TCFNet achieves outstanding evaluation metrics and visualization\nresults.

We introduce\nOrgan-Agents, a multi-agent framework that simulates human physiology via\nLLM-driven agents. Each Simulator models a specific system (e.g.,\ncardiovascular, renal, immune). Training consists of supervised fine-tuning on\nsystem-specific time-series data, followed by reinforcement-guided coordination\nusing dynamic reference selection and error correction. We curated data from\n7,134 sepsis patients and 7,895 controls, generating high-resolution\ntrajectories across 9 systems and 125 variables. Organ-Agents achieved high\nsimulation accuracy on 4,509 held-out patients, with per-system MSEs <0.16 and\nrobustness across SOFA-based severity strata. External validation on 22,689 ICU\npatients from two hospitals showed moderate degradation under distribution\nshifts with stable simulation. Organ-Agents faithfully reproduces critical\nmulti-system events (e.g., hypotension, hyperlactatemia, hypoxemia) with\ncoherent timing and phase progression. Evaluation by 15 critical care\nphysicians confirmed realism and physiological plausibility (mean Likert\nratings 3.9 and 3.7). Organ-Agents also enables counterfactual simulations\nunder alternative sepsis treatment strategies, generating trajectories and\nAPACHE II scores aligned with matched real-world patients. In downstream early\nwarning tasks, classifiers trained on synthetic data showed minimal AUROC drops\n(<0.04), indicating preserved decision-relevant patterns.

        "summary": "In one-stage multi-object detection tasks, various intersection over union\n(IoU)-based solutions aim at smooth and stable convergence near the targets\nduring training. However, IoU-based losses fail to correctly update the\ngradient of small objects due to an extremely flat gradient. During the update\nof multiple objects, the learning of small objects' gradients suffers more\nbecause of insufficient gradient updates. Therefore, we propose an inter-class\nrelational loss to efficiently update the gradient of small objects while not\nsacrificing the learning efficiency of other objects based on the simple fact\nthat an object has a spatial relationship to another object (e.g., a car plate\nis attached to a car in a similar position). When the predicted car plate's\nbounding box is not within its car, a loss punishment is added to guide the\nlearning, which is inversely proportional to the overlapped area of the car's\nand predicted car plate's bounding box. By leveraging the spatial relationship\nat the inter-class level, the loss guides small object predictions using larger\nobjects and enhances latent information in deeper feature maps. In this paper,\nwe present twofold contributions using license plate detection as a case study:\n(1) a new small vehicle multi-license plate dataset (SVMLP), featuring diverse\nreal-world scenarios with high-quality annotations; and (2) a novel inter-class\nrelational loss function designed to promote effective detection performance.\nWe highlight the proposed ICR loss penalty can be easily added to existing\nIoU-based losses and enhance the performance. These contributions improve the\nstandard mean Average Precision (mAP) metric, achieving gains of 10.3% and 1.6%\nin mAP$^{\\text{test}}_{50}$ for YOLOv12-T and UAV-DETR, respectively, without\nany additional hyperparameter tuning.

        "summary": "Prior medical image registration approaches, particularly learning-based\nmethods, often require large amounts of training data, which constrains\nclinical adoption. To overcome this limitation, we propose a training-free\npipeline that relies on a frozen DINOv3 encoder and test-time optimization of\nthe deformation field in feature space. Across two representative benchmarks,\nthe method is accurate and yields regular deformations. On Abdomen MR-CT, it\nattained the best mean Dice score (DSC) of 0.790 together with the lowest 95th\npercentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95) of 4.9+-5.0 and the lowest standard\ndeviation of Log-Jacobian (SDLogJ) of 0.08+-0.02. On ACDC cardiac MRI, it\nimproves mean DSC to 0.769 and reduces SDLogJ to 0.11 and HD95 to 4.8, a marked\ngain over the initial alignment. The results indicate that operating in a\ncompact foundation feature space at test time offers a practical and general\nsolution for clinical registration without additional training.",

It contains ten sequences of vehicle crashes at\nhigh-speed driving with 294,924 labeled 2D and 93,012 labeled 3D boxes and\ntrack IDs within 48,144 labeled frames recorded from four roadside cameras and\nLiDARs at 10 Hz. The dataset contains ten object classes and is provided in the\nOpenLABEL format. We propose Accid3nD, an accident detection model that\ncombines a rule-based approach with a learning-based one.

        "summary": "Powered by advances in multiple remote sensing sensors, the production of\nhigh spatial resolution images provides great potential to achieve\ncost-efficient and high-accuracy agricultural inventory and analysis in an\nautomated way. Lots of studies that aim at providing an inventory of the level\nof each agricultural parcel have generated many methods for Agricultural Parcel\nand Boundary Delineation (APBD). This review covers APBD methods for detecting\nand delineating agricultural parcels and systematically reviews the past and\npresent of APBD-related research applied to remote sensing images. With the\ngoal to provide a clear knowledge map of existing APBD efforts, we conduct a\ncomprehensive review of recent APBD papers to build a meta-data analysis,\nincluding the algorithm, the study site, the crop type, the sensor type, the\nevaluation method, etc. We categorize the methods into three classes: (1)\ntraditional image processing methods (including pixel-based, edge-based and\nregion-based); (2) traditional machine learning methods (such as random forest,\ndecision tree); and (3) deep learning-based methods. With deep\nlearning-oriented approaches contributing to a majority, we further discuss\ndeep learning-based methods like semantic segmentation-based, object\ndetection-based and Transformer-based methods. In addition, we discuss five\nAPBD-related issues to further comprehend the APBD domain using remote sensing\ndata, such as multi-sensor data in APBD task, comparisons between single-task\nlearning and multi-task learning in the APBD domain, comparisons among\ndifferent algorithms and different APBD tasks, etc. Finally, this review\nproposes some APBD-related applications and a few exciting prospects and\npotential hot topics in future APBD research. We hope this review help\nresearchers who involved in APBD domain to keep track of its development and\ntendency.",

Motivated\nby emerging consumer and developer use cases - AI teammates, controllable NPCs,\npersonalized live-streamers, assistive testers - we argue that an agent must\nrely on the same pixel stream available to players and generalize to new titles\nwith minimal game-specific engineering. P2P0.1 is trained end-to-end with\nbehavior cloning: labeled demonstrations collected from instrumented human\ngame-play are complemented by unlabeled public videos, to which we impute\nactions via an inverse-dynamics model. A decoder-only transformer with\nauto-regressive action output handles the large action space while remaining\nlatency-friendly on a single consumer GPU. We report qualitative results\nshowing competent play across simple Roblox and classic MS-DOS titles,\nablations on unlabeled data, and outline the scaling and evaluation steps\nrequired to reach expert-level, text-conditioned control.",
