        "summary": "We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin\ndesigned for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and\nunified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection\nand refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.\nThis work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating\nvisual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs\nconsistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap\nfrom human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two\nautomated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train\nOmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for\nuniversal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).\nThrough training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification\nand demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We\npropose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that\nleverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within\nunified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through\niterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal\nverifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.\nEmpirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),\nand GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,\nsuch as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual\nverification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation\nand scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and\ncontrollable next-generation reasoning systems.",

        "title": "NoisePrints: Distortion-Free Watermarks for Authorship in Private Diffusion Models",
        "summary": "With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,\nproving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This\nchallenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private\nand may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party\nverification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later\nverification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and\nrely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and\nnon-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight\nwatermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the\ndiffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation\nprocess. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is\nhighly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash\nfunction into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a\nvalid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an\nalternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the\nrobustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to\nuse cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing\nthe seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark\nremoval. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple\nstate-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating\nefficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access\nto model weights.",

        "summary": "Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative\nsequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and\nthe previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in\nutilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment\nwith the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual\nConditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs\nthe CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous\nframes. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively\nrestricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the\ndiffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when\nbeneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant\ninformation. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy\ndataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision\nand semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate\nthat AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity\ncompared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior\nvisuals conflict with the current input.",

        "summary": "The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content\ngeneration and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D\ngeneration. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if\none were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as\n\"generator\" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D\nreconstruction system as \"decoder\". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework\nthat does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components\nmust be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their\nweights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D\ndecoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the\ntext-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation\nrequires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video\ngenerator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the\ngenerated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D\nscene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular\ntechnique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A\napproach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All\ntested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output\nGaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also\nenables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.",

The atomic unit of a video,\nthe pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the\nprimitive element of dynamics.

With this\nrepresentation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the\nentire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each\npixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that\nparameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at\narbitrary query time instants.

Extensive experiments show that\nLogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,\nGMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.\nOur smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on\nImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average\naccuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%\nreduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph\nconstruction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of\ncurrent state-of-the-art ViGs.

However, most existing multimodal models remain\nconstrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent\na balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although\nhybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks\nwithin unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs\nlimit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal\nretrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal\nfoundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow\nparadigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal\nvelocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation\nwith enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios\nthrough concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs.\nTrained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data,\nNExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and\nunderstanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in\nmulti-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its\narchitectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model.

To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal\nvision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit\nand implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.\nSpecifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into\nnatural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit\nprompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct\nindividualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both\nprompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to\nchanges in target state.

        "summary": "Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic\nvideos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to\ngenerate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address\nthis issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a\nrepresentation for guiding video generation models to enhance their\nphysics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task\nwhere the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the\ninput image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative\npositions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise\nPhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to\ninject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper\nsupervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance\nmotivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to\nphysical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation\nmodels to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for\nimproving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,\nproving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging\nphysical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions\nfor various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement\nlearning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware\nvideo generation and broader applications.",

Existing open-source datasets are often\nplagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,\nsuch as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model\ncapabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary\ncontributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising\napproximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning\ntechniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment\nstrategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its\nunderlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and\nadaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset\nreleases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B\nmodel on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is\ncompetitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as\nInternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational\nresources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite\ncomprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;\nand the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data\nquality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly\ncompetitive with their semi-open counterparts.",

Its core idea is spatially guided\nvision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical\nlink between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage\npipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning\ndata to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,\nembodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training\nto decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through\nplug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields\nconsistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance\nby +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO\nFranka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,\npoint, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a\nsimulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,\nenabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In\nreal-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with\nsynthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel\nconfigurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it\nsurpassed existing works by over 10%.

This process not only\ntransforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,\nbut also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On\nvarious visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,\nRECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use\ncode for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping.

        "summary": "Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant\npotential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers\nfrom low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can\nreduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,\nsynthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There\nis a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural\ndetails, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we\npropose a \\emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for\nhigh-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to\nreformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It\nenforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than\njust relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further\nincorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns\ninter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure\ncorrection network enhances local feature restoration through\nself-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on\ncross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,\nachieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,\n0.943 $\\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise\nfidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared\nwith the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops\nfrom 12.1$\\%$ to 2.1$\\%$, cortex from 4.2$\\%$ to 3.7$\\%$). To conclude, our\nCSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and\nanatomically consistent.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose\nto reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical\nimage regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the\nassessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are\nsafe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments.

        "summary": "Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant\npromise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of\nanalysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals\nshould represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence\nof pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying\nonly the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)\nhave become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology\ndata. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the\nassumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease\nregions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.\nMore recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better\nguide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the\ngenerative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies\nwith the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we\npropose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -\nwhich, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial\npoint (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a\ncorresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the\npathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate\ncounterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively\nremoving pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously\nproposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and\nanomaly detection tasks.",

To bridge\nthe quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode\npost-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented\nmode to high-quality MV-oriented mode.

        "summary": "Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful\nparadigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked\nmodeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models\nsuffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack\nof a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation\nacross the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this\nwork, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues\nby introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next\nframe, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides\nglobal structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame\nsynthesis.

        "summary": "Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data\ndomains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the\ninsufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a\nsemi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale\nunlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments\nto mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we\nbuild a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial\nappearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and\neye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader\ndistribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a\nreward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels\nas 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings\nextracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze\nperspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute\nconfidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality\npseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five\ndatasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also\nevaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze\nestimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen\ndatasets.",

Despite advancements in\nimaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images\noften suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which\nlimit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust\npreprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with\ndeep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This\nsystematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the\nkey challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image\nenhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review\nprovides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across\ndifferent imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in\nassessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified\nas the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most\nattention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and\nbone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize\nconventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1\nexplores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies\nemploy both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on\nreference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a\ntotal of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based.

        "summary": "Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,\nhealthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on\nvisual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as\nocclusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of\nlarge-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in\nmultimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study\npresents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition\nframework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main\nmodules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion\nstrategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal\nrelationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model\nextracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both\nlocal and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion\nmechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional\nNetwork (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the\nfused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel\nVisual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as\na medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized\naudio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\nthat AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on\nthe XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing\nstate-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,\nefficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as\nthe utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition\nresearch.",

Generally, this is carried out based on\nthe estimated attenuation map obtained from computed tomography or magnetic\nresonance imaging. However, except for errors in the attenuation correction\nfactors obtained, the additional scan not only brings in new radiation doses\nand/or increases the scanning time but also leads to severe misalignment\ninduced by various motions during and between the two sequential scans. To\naddress these issues, based on maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a new\nmathematical model for simultaneously reconstructing the activity and\nattenuation sinogram from the time-of-flight (TOF)-PET emission data only.\nParticularly, we make full use of the exclusively exponential form for the\nattenuation correction factors, and consider the constraint of a total amount\nof the activity in some mask region in the proposed model. Furthermore, we\nprove its well-posedness, including the existence, uniqueness and stability of\nthe solution.

Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural\ngroups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but\nexhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)\npopulations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate\npatterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced\nsettings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur.

These scores serve as a foundation for hard\nnegative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the\nidentification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the\nsemantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid\none-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft\nsemantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among\ncandidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity.

        "summary": "In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and\nhuman-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.\nReal-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some\nfactors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and\ndemographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for\napplications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently\nchallenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we\npropose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both\nConvolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to\novercome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent\nexpert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility\nto model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy\nof emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect\nboth global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous\nCNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and\nfinally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate\nefficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared\nwith current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%\non AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on\nFER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to\ndevelop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.\nReproducible codes and results are made publicly accessible at\nhttps://github.com/DeeptimaanB/ExpressNet-MoE.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models have recently enabled state-of-the-art reconstruction of\npositron emission tomography (PET) images while requiring only image training\ndata. However, domain shift remains a key concern for clinical adoption: priors\ntrained on images from one anatomy, acquisition protocol or pathology may\nproduce artefacts on out-of-distribution data. We propose integrating steerable\nconditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled\ndiffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion\nmodel's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion\nstep, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with\nthe target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain\nphantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under\ndomain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and\ntested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure,\noutperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and\nquantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors\ncan mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate\nfuture evaluation on real data.",

To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust\nperception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically\ninterpretable factors.

To\naddress this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that\noptimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method\nparameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets\nand scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric\nregularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing\nneuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.\nThis approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a\nway to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond\nconventional pixel-based methods.",

Unlike existing methods limited\nto lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining\nprecise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in\nimage inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture\ncomplexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale\nthe diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural\noverhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and\nunmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural\nconsistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention\nmechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity\nthrough adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely\naddresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling\nglobal semantics from localized refinement.

This study\npresents the application of a vision-language model (VLM) -- which has\ndemonstrated strong performance in image recognition and image-text retrieval\ntasks -- to product recommendations on Mercari, a major consumer-to-consumer\nmarketplace used by more than 20 million monthly users in Japan. Specifically,\nwe fine-tuned SigLIP, a VLM employing a sigmoid-based contrastive loss, using\none million product image-title pairs from Mercari collected over a three-month\nperiod, and developed an image encoder for generating item embeddings used in\nthe recommendation system. Our evaluation comprised an offline analysis of\nhistorical interaction logs and an online A/B test in a production environment.\nIn offline analysis, the model achieved a 9.1% improvement in nDCG@5 compared\nwith the baseline. In the online A/B test, the click-through rate improved by\n50% whereas the conversion rate improved by 14% compared with the existing\nmodel. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of VLM-based encoders for\ne-commerce product recommendations and provide practical insights into the\ndevelopment of visual similarity-based recommendation systems.",

When test\nvideos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are\nunavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)\nmethods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are\nprimarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered\nvideos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to\ntemporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented\nvideo dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA\nmetric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range\nof 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various\ndisplay types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on\nthis dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality\nby looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric\nto existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered\nvideos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark\nsupersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time\nrendering.",

While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed\nto mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual\naugmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,\nlimiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free\ndecoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key\ncontributions.

Extensive experiments\nacross four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding\nsignificantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art\ndecoding methods.

        "summary": "This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method\n(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in\ninput images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike\nconventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the\nimage as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the\nimage reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes\nan encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked\nlow-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to\nidentify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to\nreconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the\npre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive\nlearning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration\ntasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained\nencoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve\noutstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves\nperformance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with\na minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and\na 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation\nscenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen\ndegradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M\ndataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19\ndegradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic\nand real-world data.

Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their\ninternal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and\ntextual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the\ninternal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability\ntechniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA\ntasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame\ninteractions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive\nvideo-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment\nbetween video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal\nconcepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to\ngenerate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,\nwe show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these\neffective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of\nattention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT.

        "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in\nrobot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from\nnatural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial\nrobustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial\npatch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first\nintroduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic\nadversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the\ncamera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to\ndifferent VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model\narchitecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these\npatches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual\nlatent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent\nrepresentations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.\nThrough the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's\ninterpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate\nincorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given\nrobotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for\nthe visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent\nrepresentations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.\nExtensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation\nbenchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate\nof cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates\nthis degradation.

        "summary": "In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have\nrecently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning\nfor adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''\nparadigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain\nblurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,\nreflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their\nrespective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT\nfrom first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed\nPrompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing\nmethods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further\norganizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond\nthe core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,\nincluding medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well\nas its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize\ncurrent benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the\nbest of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's\nmethodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our\nsurvey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all\narea to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.",

Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes\nin speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To\naddress these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to\nenhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and\npart-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to\nencode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained\nregional differences.

        "summary": "Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia\ncontent understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic\ncorrespondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint\nembedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information\nentropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an\nimbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this\nparticular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment\nability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved\nthrough a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on\nexplicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the\npolysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy\nof the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A\nhypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the\ntext and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching\nerrors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst\nreducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced\ndimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the\nFlickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic\nHypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\\%\n(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while\nestablishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.",

VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration\naccuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations.

Unlike conventional methods,\nVPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms\nrather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid\ngeneration approach, referred to as \\emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which\nconstructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.\nThese VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations\nessential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more\naccurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed\napproach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain\nscans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for\n35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of\nthe computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the\ncomputed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse\nmap.

FMP\npropagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,\npreserving temporal consistency.\n  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the\ncached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness\nthroughout the video sequence.\n  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks\nfor the instances of interest.\n  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,\nenabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing\nEdit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving\nthe background integrity.\n  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed\nEdit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and\nvisual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.",

        "title": "Counting Hallucinations in Diffusion Models",
        "summary": "Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress\nin generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still\noften produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with\nreal-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating\nbeside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible\nmethodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders\nprogress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for\ndesigning next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this\nwork, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which\nwe term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect\nnumber of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six\nfingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this\nend, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting\ncriteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,\nwe develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting\nhallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in\nDPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial\nnoise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their\ncorrelation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this\nwidely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations\nconsistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically\nquantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the\ninvestigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.",

        "summary": "Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when\ndeployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both\nimage appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical\ncharacteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel\nunsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts\nencountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific\nemphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style\nharmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image\nregistration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with\nsegmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect\nto a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations\nthat align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through\ncomprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for\ncontrolled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets\nrepresenting populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all\nexperiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus\nsegmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical\ndementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in\nDice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains\nobserved in scenarios with substantial content shift.

We analyze prior work on\nself-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The\nsame set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.\nHere, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable\nof true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple\naugmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables\ndisentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric\nreasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with\nunconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or\nconcepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of\nposes as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify\ntransferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that\nXFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show\nthat latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing\nexperiments.",

However, existing motion generation approaches\naddress either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since\nconstructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and\nprecise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce\nSceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned\nmotion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets\nthrough two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The\nkey idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task\nto bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to\ntext-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that\nmodulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.\nIn the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene\ngeometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.\nExperimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness\ninto text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which\nthis awareness emerges.

However, they struggle with generating\ncoherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through\nmultiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality\nmetrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To\nbridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating\nsequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully\ndesigned dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with\n2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.\nAdditionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic\nevaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and\ntemporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based\nmetric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through\nsystematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current\nT2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action\nsequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and\ndifficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between\nsequential actions.

Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth\nraw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties\ninherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor\nsafe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural\nLanguage Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based\nplanning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural\nlanguage messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in\ndecision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego\nCAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information\nexchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively\nexpress their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that\nmaximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate\nonly the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the\nscalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse\ndriving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31%\nincrease in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and\na four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.\nProject website: https://uncap-project.github.io/",

        "summary": "Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as\nVQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to\nstructured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses\nchallenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image\ndiversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system\ntailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided\nby clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which\ninjects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple\nview-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically\nfaithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability\nacross diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks\nwhile aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train\nFetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale\nfetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical\ncenters, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show\nthat FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all\ngestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on\ncritical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable.

This requires\nbuilding high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be\nsafely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering\nmethods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering\nspeeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to\napplications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.\nMulti-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle\ncross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the\nexpense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first\nmethod capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in\nreal-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera\nmodels, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary\nspinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor\ninconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and\nanchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%\ncompared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing\napproaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles\na wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked\nautonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing\nstate-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.",

        "summary": "This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral\nimaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted\nthrough four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several\nanalyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral\nanalysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis\nwith PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual\ninformation are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a\n2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to\nperforming spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning\na spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,\nPLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean\ncontent of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.\nModeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is\nlimited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.\nTherefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat\ncontent in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and\npixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN\naugmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with\nPLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by\nanalyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results\nwere inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,\nthis thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The\nfirst facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very\nfast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a\nnew algorithm.",

This deficiency is\nmanifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance\non external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding\nand spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective\ndual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both\nsemantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D\nrepresentation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing\nthe number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,\nGS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely\nwithout external modules while delivering performance comparable to\nstate-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework\nfor 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we\nintroduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is\nmeticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects\nreferenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that\nintegrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results\non 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial\nreasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.",

Voxel-level segmentation is an\nimportant first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full\nquantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,\nconventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable\ncenterlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available\ncenterline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a\nthinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline\ngraphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200\nstroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to\ndevelop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining\nU-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated\non a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.\nFurther, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA\nvariants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect\nsubtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed\ngraph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node\ndistance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features\nsuch as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong\nrobustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above\n0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization\ncombined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline\nextraction.

However, VPR systems face significant challenges\nwhen deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal\nchanges, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as\nloop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)\npipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose\nthree training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by\nanalyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing\nVPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by\nmeasuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates\ncompetitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty\n(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that\ngeneralizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data\nto select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional\nmodel training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive\ngeometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art\nVPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at\ndiscriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently\noutperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational\noverhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied\nenvironmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.",

To realize collaborative\nperception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align\nneighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise\nfrom domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.\nMoreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which\ncauses the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these\nissues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages\nDomain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.\nThe CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight\nSpatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation\n(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)\nloss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the\nneighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight\nconvolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution\ndiscrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation\nmodules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter\ncaptures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the\nmutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain\nseparation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which\nensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the\nCoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and\nachieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.",

        "summary": "Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients\nand trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for\nscene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that\nemphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS\nexplicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches\ninapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel\nGS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view\ncontributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn\nrequires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this\npaper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)\nstrategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client\nfor loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication\nresources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve\nefficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to\nselect the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization\n(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint\nclient selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the\nGS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the\nnonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution\nbased on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.\nExperiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing\nbenchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective\ncan be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method\nachieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication\ncosts.",

On\nvideo from the BDD100K driving dataset, Dedelayed improves semantic\nsegmentation accuracy over the stronger of the local-only and remote-only\nbaselines across all realistic communication network delays beyond 33 ms.\nWithout incurring additional delay, it improves accuracy by 6.4 mIoU compared\nto fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference, for a\nround-trip delay of 100 ms. The advantage grows under longer delays and\nhigher-motion scenes, as delay-mitigated split inference sustains accuracy more\neffectively, providing clear advantages for real-time tasks that must remain\naligned with the current world state.",

        "summary": "Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot\nanomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible\nare these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their\nanomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a\ntraining-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present\none of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty\nestimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while\npreserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen\nDINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we\nevaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe\nconsistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible\nperturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce\nconfident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and\nfind that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between\nconfidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong\nbaseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly\nscores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield\nsignificantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than\non clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection\nwhile reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete\nvulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an\nevaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly\ndetection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty\nquantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly\ndetection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.",

        "summary": "Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous\nLocalization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly\ndeployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing\nUnits (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,\nand feature detection and SLAM in particular.\n  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable\nGate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first\nstudy of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM\n(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated\nFAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated\ncounterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).\n  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector\nsuch as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated\nV-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the\nFAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.\nHowever, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its\nFPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy\nefficiency (up to 3.1$\\times$ and 1.4$\\times$ improvements, respectively) than\nthe GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable\nrun-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in\n2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show\nthat the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated\nV-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for\nfeature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline\nby having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without\nsacrificing accuracy.",

        "title": "Generalizing WiFi Gesture Recognition via Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment",
        "summary": "WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm\nfor enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in\nAIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited\ngeneralization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature\nof Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed\nLarge-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages\nthe semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture\nrepresentation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.\nSpecifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures\ngeometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and\nDoppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale\nSemantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with\ngesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance\ncategory discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme\nthat encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially\nfor semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust\nDual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight\nstudent network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed\nsoft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0\nbenchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in\nboth in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly\nreducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and\ndeployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world\nAIoT applications.",

Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,\nMicrowave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon\ndetection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as\npoor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave\nimaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and\nprivacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack\nof availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a\ndataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based\narchitecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to\nthe unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt\ndeformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;\nbackbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling\nDEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal\nhomogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In\naddition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce\na new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a\ndiverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset\nfor this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class\nimbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task.

Motivated\nby our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all\nother network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently\ntrained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume\nfrom optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly\nimproved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training\nstrategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.\nOur most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being\n$1.2\\times$ faster and having a $6\\times$ lower memory footprint than\ncomparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at\n$20\\,\\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\\,\\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.",

        "summary": "Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene\ngeometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic\nreconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of\ntraditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive\nCPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning\n(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale\nscenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,\nthe blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes\nwith the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various\nexternal optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM\npipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are\nunable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption\nincreases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash\nthe full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical\nstage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in\nsparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these\ntechniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.\nThrough extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images\nwhere VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about\n40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even\nimproved reconstruction accuracy.

The key to this task\nis to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their\nbase class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the\npoints from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation\nlearning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a\ncausal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning\nprocess, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond\nto the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural\ncausal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,\ni.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we\nfirst analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the\ncausal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise\na causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the\ncausal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model\nthe causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation\nprototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base\nto novel classes.

However, the existing\ncounting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded\nsystems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex\ncalculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the\nmodel to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering\nthe aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a\nstem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the\nfastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution\nkernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which\neffectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we\nuse conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge\nmulti-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial\nto the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid\nnetworks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion\nproblems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for\nsuper real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive\naccuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the\nfastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX\n1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.",

Inspired by the human brain's\nsimultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we\npropose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry\ninteraction to extract multiple vector types within a single model.

        "summary": "State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure\nin understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This\nlimitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To\naddress this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline\nand (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a\ndataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based\npipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we\npropose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the\narchitectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the\nstructural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes\ninto coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input\nlevel, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For\ninstance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens \"not\" and\n\"girl\" as simply \"girl\", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning\nis correctly distinguished from that of \"girl\" alone. This module is integrated\nwith a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method\nsignificantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a\nlowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval\nand demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step\nforward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection\napplications.",

In real production lines, extreme\nforeground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale\ndistribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training\nand evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it\ndifficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the\nmain bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong\npixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the\nsample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a\nmismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC\ndecisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning\nframework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the\nmethod jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask\nlocalization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,\nat the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast\ndefects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to\nenhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we\npropose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias\nof classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple\nlocalization quality with sample-level decisions.

        "summary": "Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical\napplications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,\ntime-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While\nrecent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,\nthese models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario\ndata, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from\ndifferent geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment\noften struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological\nconditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising\nperformance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization\nTest-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess\nintrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,\nwhich remain consistent across different regions regardless of external\nconditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for\nguiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust\nparameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance\nin new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.\nSpecifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic\ncharacteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the\nmodel during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to\nadapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses\nderived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order\nvariation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA\nmethods.",

However,\nrecent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic\naccuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training\nenvironment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning\nmethods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they\noften struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the\ntraining setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of\ndisease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and\nenvironment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative\nto task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.\nTo tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning\nframework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),\ngrounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a\nlimited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and\nleverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess\nTMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset\ncomprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21\ndiseases and healthy instances across three crop species.

        "title": "State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos",
        "summary": "Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical\nvideo, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides\nactionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling\nbetter resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for\ncomplications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current\nsurgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than\npredicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,\nlacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)\nand long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These\nmethods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action\ntriplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on\nfuture feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical\ncontexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future\nprediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,\nour approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.\nWe introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student\narchitecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via\nSinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and\nfuture clips, while the student network predicts future states from current\nvideos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish\nSFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and\nlong-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.\nExperiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent\nimprovements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.",

        "title": "The Mechanistic Emergence of Symbol Grounding in Language Models",
        "summary": "Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire\ntheir meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent\nwork has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in\n(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding\nobjectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that\ndrive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a\ncontrolled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding\narises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal\nanalysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer\ncomputations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where\nattention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of\nlinguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across\narchitectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional\nLSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol\ngrounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for\npredicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.",

        "title": "Learning Neural Parametric 3D Breast Shape Models for Metrical Surface Reconstruction From Monocular RGB Videos",
        "summary": "We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this\nmodel, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline\ncapable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In\ncontrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D\nbreast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method\nrequires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used\nwith any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of\nour pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion\npipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically\ncorrect surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed\nimplicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural\nrepresentations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which\nemploys a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --\ninspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit\nbreast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural\nSDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our\nsurface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for\nlocalized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of\nreconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its\nglobal counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to\nrecover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2\nmm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and\nopen-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at\nhttps://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.",
