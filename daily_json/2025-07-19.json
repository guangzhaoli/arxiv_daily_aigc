        "summary": "We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source\n(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases\nsurpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,\nCLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training\npipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and\na subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in\nSSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to\nlarge codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to\naccount for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we\nintroduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on\nnested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features\ninto increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,\nenabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a\nnovel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional\nbiases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic\ncontent. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,\ndemonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions\nestablish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and\nopen a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for\nthe broader AI community.

        "summary": "Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that\nfollow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their\nsupervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,\nedited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect\nonly prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical\nplausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated\nedit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an\nautomated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,\nresolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative\nmodels and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned\nGemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,\nremoving any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and\ncompositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,\nenabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most\nrepetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training\nwithout human labeling effort. To democratize research in this\nresource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k\nhigh-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses\nall public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source\nfine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our\nexperiments.",

For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views\nand inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital\nrealm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive\nexperiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition\nbetween day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on\nNeural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing\nnovel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling\nremains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this\nend, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance\nfields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our\nmodel with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us\nto construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and\nfurther enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.\nFinally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.\nExperiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting\nwithout per-scene optimization.

        "summary": "In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered\nconsiderable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual\ndescriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion\nrepresentation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing\napproaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video\nframes, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to\ninconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free\nEncapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both\nvisual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach\nutilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video\nframes by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing\nthem with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to\nensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior\ninto the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of\nboth types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion\nquality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach\ncompared to previous approaches.

        "summary": "Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable\nperformance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable\nDiffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,\nreal-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and\nfine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay\nmethods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine\nretention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced\nsynthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a\nfrozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique\nvisual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,\nconfidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by\npost-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most\nrepresentative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them\nby confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with\nexisting replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay\nfidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning\n(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay\ntechniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and\nzero-shot capability.

Current\napproaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect\nlocalized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an\nuncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a\nglobal-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity\nand then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach\nemploys evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding\nthe extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression\nmechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement\nstrategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate\nboth contextual information and fine-grained details.

Posture estimation algorithms are applied to\nreal-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are\nused to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving\neight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created\ndescriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial\naccuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven\ntasks based on overall temporal similarity.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of\nanomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,\nincluding blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the\nUCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,\nBN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method\nresponds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on\nthe algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain\nanonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models\ninadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the\nstrong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.\nThese results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization\nand emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining\ndetection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization\ntechniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often\noverlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.\nThrough comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a\ncompelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands\nof anomaly detection.",

While token reduction, an effective compression\ntechnique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision\nMamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we\nfind that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to\nVision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily\nbecause Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most\ntoken reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance\nmeasurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we\ninvestigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token\nimportance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further\npropose MTR, a training-free \\textbf{M}amba \\textbf{T}oken \\textbf{R}eduction\nframework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our\nmethod can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various\nMamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly\nreduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across\nvarious tasks and multiple backbones.

        "summary": "A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual\nperception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal\narchitecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual\ndifferences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity\npatterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational\nprinciple. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common\ntrajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its\ntransformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We\nintroduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining\ninter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this\nframework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we\nreveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two\npathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal\nstream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is\ncaptured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing\nthe specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a\nconvergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and\nartificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.",

We introduce\nDiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit\nstatic-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static\ntoken from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing\nstatic content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates\nthree key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a\ntime-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing\nstatic information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention\nthat routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens\nframe-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual\nstatic-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using\nswap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms\nstate-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest\nswap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic\ntransfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.",

        "summary": "Ultra-high resolution 7 tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides\ndetailed anatomical views, offering better signal-to-noise ratio, resolution\nand tissue contrast than 3T MRI, though at the cost of accessibility. We\npresent an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T\nbrain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172\nparticipants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish\nBioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models:\na specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art\n3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI\nprofessionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T\nimages, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due\nto the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the\namygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually\nsegmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images\nthat were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed\nsimilar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive\nstatus using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic\nT1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T\nimages, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising\nperformance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use\ncases, and limitations are discussed.",

        "summary": "Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image\nclassification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency\nare prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this\nstudy, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through\na novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and\ncomputationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis\nbut rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and\npropose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction\napproach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,\ndiagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the\ndiscriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image\ndescriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and\nedge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an\nimage. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is\nused to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid\nsearch. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,\nincluding Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers\ncompetitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.\nOur results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a\ncompact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive\nand limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of\nentropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight\nand generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image\nclassification and computer vision.",

One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based\ngenerative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of\nproducing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of\nhow such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of\nStyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such\nas the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the\nmodel's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,\nenabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is\nrevealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without\ndrastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational\nrequirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily\ninfluences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global\nalterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while\ntargeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of\nspecific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of\nacademic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential\nmisuse of such technology.

Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction\nstrategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and\nstructural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and\nocclusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our\nobservation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than\nrigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the\nreconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the\nregion-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking\nguidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions\nthan to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the\nlatter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire\nfingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world\ninteractions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained\nencoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven\nmultimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the\nlearned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and\nobjects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of\nmonocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues.

Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient\nrestoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).\nSpecifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block\nlevel, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to\nachieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the\nintra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative\nto self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity\nwhile preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks\nsuch as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion\ndeblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light\nenhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art\nmethods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with\nsignificantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.",

        "summary": "The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to\ngenerate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole\nusage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of\nhybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF\nrepresentation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar\ngeneration qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their\ndeformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the\ndeformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational\ncosts on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points\nare located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but\nresult in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we\npropose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel\nefficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In\nEPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray\nomission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that\nprogress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval\non the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.\nThe delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational\ncost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important\nregions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without\nhierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the\ngeneration quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around\n20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.\nWe provide video results on https://github.com/seungjun-moon/epsilon.",

Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which\nstruggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving\ncamera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion\nLikelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of\nintegrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus\nof expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood\nfrom the outliers of the FoE computation.

        "summary": "Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is\ndifficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is\na more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches\nrely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to\nsharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur\npatterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based\nframework, dubbed \\ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying\ntexture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \\ours performs DM to generate\nthe prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To\nimplement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a\nmemory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for\nDM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the\nTexture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel\nFilter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes\nspatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we\nimplement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture\ndetails. Extensive evaluations show that \\ours provides a promising\nunsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used\nbenchmarks.",

Existing VolVis approaches have explored\nnon-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,\nand informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods\noften rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single\nstyle, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we\nadvocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian\nprimitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style\ntransfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives\ntightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization\nresults. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian\nsplatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,\nextending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,\nresulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced\nlighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving\nflexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance\nstylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing\ntailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing\nwith fine-grained control.

In patients with movement disorders,\nthe ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can\nenable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as\nneeded. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using\nInertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on\napplication-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in\ndifferent environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a\nnew cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations\nfrom large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved\ngeneralizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,\nincluding a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.\nSpecifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining\napproach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining\napproach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.\nBroadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,\nsuch as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn\ngeneralizable data representations.

However, the narrow scope of many training\ndatasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is\nparticularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance\nvaries widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent\ndomain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training\ndeep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and\nanatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation\nmaps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen\nduring training, without retraining or fine-tuning.

        "summary": "Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D\nreconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances\nacross multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance\nfeatures or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these\napproaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations\nare corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves\nas an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D\nreconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected\ndelta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate\ndetections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,\nwith edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap\nclustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise\nand partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate\nInterquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error\ncriterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on\nsynthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based\nbaselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high\nobject density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it\nwell-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.",

        "summary": "Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely\ndeployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and\nhealthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model\ncomplexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,\nunidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and\nrobustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient\nand robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the\nlinear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,\ncombined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among\nmodalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality\nalignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive\nlow-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities\npost-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant\nadaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the\nfusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On\nthe SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower\nerror than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance\nboost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity\nrecognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),\noutperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while\ntraining less than 0.3% of parameters.

This heterogeneity\nposes significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To\naddress these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for\ncooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras\n(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that\nadaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial\nattention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality\nfeature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an\nadaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance\ncomputational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across\ndifferent configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy\nthat dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments\non the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%\n3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D\nbaseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC\nscenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine\nheterogeneous sensor configurations.

        "title": "Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Aerial and UAV Photogrammetry through Error Propagation",
        "summary": "Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for\nproviding per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne\nLiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the\naccuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it\nrelies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).\nGenerally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a\ntwo-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),\nfollowed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM\nstage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the\nreprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and\nnon-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal\nnature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an\nuncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error\ncovariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry\nprocess. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose\na novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)\nper-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such\nas matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,\nour method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the\nMVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering\nto error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a\nrobust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We\nevaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV\nimagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing\napproaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.",

        "summary": "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's\nDisease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow\nthe progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant\nchallenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection\nbias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention\nframework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal\nIntervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language\nmodel (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining\nstructured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.\nThe ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)\nimages and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into\nCognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of\nconfounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,\nnon-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,\ngenerating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates\nconfounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the\noutstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,\nachieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics.

In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable\ngeometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR\ndata in autonomous driving scenarios.

In this paper, we address the limited\nexpressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative\ncapability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted\nby DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to\nenrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we\npropose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature\nextraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global\nsemantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.\nTo effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a\nbidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local\ncues.

Additionally, existing methods assume\nthat camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios\nlike crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that\nintegrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit\nstructural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional\nground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a\npoint cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts\nexplicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously\nextracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to\nsample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a\nper-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to\nenhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark\ndataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters\ninstead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in\nscenarios where camera calibration is infeasible, unlike previous methods.",

Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms\nprimarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving\nprivacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are\ntypically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera\ndatasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance\nand generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper\nintroduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.\nThe dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,\nwith data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.\nWe also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid\nfoundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on\nour newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian\nattribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for\nperson re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only\neffectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event\nstreams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic\nfeatures. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully\nvalidated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.\nThe benchmark dataset and source code will be released on\nhttps://github.com/Event-AHU/Neuromorphic_ReID",

        "summary": "The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics\ndemands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially\nfor large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like\nconductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data\nacquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we\nintroduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately\nreconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM\nscans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and\nexperimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow\nimplementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to\ncollect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)\nour SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that\nrequires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).\nSparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in\nMoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of\ncrystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction\nin acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM\nimage. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit\nremarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using\nclassic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward\ntranslating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research\nto industrial fabrication.

This design drastically\nreduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in\nan unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration\nof quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction.

Aiming\nto classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,\nthis study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method.

The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the\nDeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual\nexplanation technique.

The superior performances of the two-step method are validated\nby experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)\nof the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,\nwhich are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and\nTransformer based models.

However, these degradation kernels, which model the\ntransition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account\nfor not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying\nthe same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be\nimpractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors\nas pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that\nutilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.\nBy employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR\nimage, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then\napplied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR\nreference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our\nreference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind\nSR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous\nmethods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling\nfactors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the\neffectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.",

We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that\nachieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose\nco-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The\nfirst is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO\nfeatures from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for\ncamera pose regularization.

        "summary": "This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of\nmulti-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an\nextension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and\nmeasures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an\nextension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy\nbetween sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these\nquasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected\nobjects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The\nT-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the\nGOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of\npenalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation\ncosts are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT\nevaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT\nalgorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.",

Our approach\nquantifies regularity within the framework of microlocal spaces introduced by\nJaffard. The central tool in our analysis is the fast samplet transform, a\ndistributional wavelet transform tailored to scattered data. We establish a\nconnection between the decay of samplet coefficients and the pointwise\nregularity of multivariate signals. As a by product, we derive decay estimates\nfor functions belonging to classical H\\\"older spaces and Sobolev-Slobodeckij\nspaces. While traditional wavelets are effective for regularity detection in\nlow-dimensional structured data, samplets demonstrate robust performance even\nfor higher dimensional and scattered data. To illustrate our theoretical\nfindings, we present extensive numerical studies detecting local regularity of\none-, two- and three-dimensional signals, ranging from non-uniformly sampled\ntime series over image segmentation to edge detection in point clouds.",

        "summary": "Breast MRI provides high-resolution imaging critical for breast cancer\nscreening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for\nbreast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical\nstructures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full\nrange of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative\nanalysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation\nalgorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular\ntissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and\nimplant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these\nstructures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist.\nAdditionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet,\nUNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among\nthem, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across\nall labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone,\nwith Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All\nmodel code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data\nat a later date.",
