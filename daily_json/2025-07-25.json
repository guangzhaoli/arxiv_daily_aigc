        "summary": "We present Captain Cinema, a generation framework for short movie generation.\nGiven a detailed textual description of a movie storyline, our approach firstly\ngenerates a sequence of keyframes that outline the entire narrative, which\nensures long-range coherence in both the storyline and visual appearance (e.g.,\nscenes and characters). We refer to this step as top-down keyframe planning.\nThese keyframes then serve as conditioning signals for a video synthesis model,\nwhich supports long context learning, to produce the spatio-temporal dynamics\nbetween them. This step is referred to as bottom-up video synthesis. To support\nstable and efficient generation of multi-scene long narrative cinematic works,\nwe introduce an interleaved training strategy for Multimodal Diffusion\nTransformers (MM-DiT), specifically adapted for long-context video data. Our\nmodel is trained on a specially curated cinematic dataset consisting of\ninterleaved data pairs. Our experiments demonstrate that Captain Cinema\nperforms favorably in the automated creation of visually coherent and narrative\nconsistent short movies in high quality and efficiency.

        "title": "SynC: Synthetic Image Caption Dataset Refinement with One-to-many Mapping for Zero-shot Image Captioning",
        "summary": "Zero-shot Image Captioning (ZIC) increasingly utilizes synthetic datasets\ngenerated by text-to-image (T2I) models to mitigate the need for costly manual\nannotation. However, these T2I models often produce images that exhibit\nsemantic misalignments with their corresponding input captions (e.g., missing\nobjects, incorrect attributes), resulting in noisy synthetic image-caption\npairs that can hinder model training. Existing dataset pruning techniques are\nlargely designed for removing noisy text in web-crawled data. However, these\nmethods are ill-suited for the distinct challenges of synthetic data, where\ncaptions are typically well-formed, but images may be inaccurate\nrepresentations. To address this gap, we introduce SynC, a novel framework\nspecifically designed to refine synthetic image-caption datasets for ZIC.\nInstead of conventional filtering or regeneration, SynC focuses on reassigning\ncaptions to the most semantically aligned images already present within the\nsynthetic image pool. Our approach employs a one-to-many mapping strategy by\ninitially retrieving multiple relevant candidate images for each caption. We\nthen apply a cycle-consistency-inspired alignment scorer that selects the best\nimage by verifying its ability to retrieve the original caption via\nimage-to-text retrieval. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SynC\nconsistently and significantly improves performance across various ZIC models\non standard benchmarks (MS-COCO, Flickr30k, NoCaps), achieving state-of-the-art\nresults in several scenarios. SynC offers an effective strategy for curating\nrefined synthetic data to enhance ZIC.",

These models are trained on\nlarge-scale image and video datasets paired with text, enabling them to bridge\nvisual perception and natural language processing. However, their application\nto scientific domains, especially in interpreting complex field data commonly\nused in the natural sciences, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce\nFieldLVLM, a novel framework designed to improve large vision-language models'\nunderstanding of field data. FieldLVLM consists of two main components: a\nfield-aware language generation strategy and a data-compressed multimodal model\ntuning. The field-aware language generation strategy leverages a\nspecial-purpose machine learning pipeline to extract key physical features from\nfield data, such as flow classification, Reynolds number, and vortex patterns.\nThis information is then converted into structured textual descriptions that\nserve as a dataset. The data-compressed multimodal model tuning focuses on\nLVLMs with these generated datasets, using a data compression strategy to\nreduce the complexity of field inputs and retain only the most informative\nvalues. This ensures compatibility with the models language decoder and guides\nits learning more effectively. Experimental results on newly proposed benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that FieldLVLM significantly outperforms existing methods\nin tasks involving scientific field data.

Despite recent advances, these existing\nmethods are inherently intrusive, as they either modify the model parameters or\nalter the structure. This natural intrusiveness raises concerns about\nwatermarking-induced shifts in model behavior and the additional cost of\nfine-tuning, further exacerbated by the rapidly growing model size. As a\nresult, model owners are often reluctant to adopt DNN watermarking in practice,\nwhich limits the development of practical Watermarking as a Service (WaaS)\nsystems. To address this issue, we introduce Nonintrusive Watermarking as a\nService (NWaaS), a novel trustless paradigm designed for X-to-Image models, in\nwhich we hypothesize that with the model untouched, an owner-defined watermark\ncan still be extracted from model outputs. Building on this concept, we propose\nShadowMark, a concrete implementation of NWaaS which addresses critical\ndeployment challenges by establishing a robust and nonintrusive side channel in\nthe protected model's black-box API, leveraging a key encoder and a watermark\ndecoder. It is significantly distinctive from existing solutions by attaining\nthe so-called absolute fidelity and being applicable to different DNN\narchitectures, while being also robust against existing attacks, eliminating\nthe fidelity-robustness trade-off.

Despite\nsubstantial progress, producing high-fidelity and temporally consistent dynamic\n4D content remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose MVG4D, a novel\nframework that generates dynamic 4D content from a single still image by\ncombining multi-view synthesis with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4D GS). At its core,\nMVG4D employs an image matrix module that synthesizes temporally coherent and\nspatially diverse multi-view images, providing rich supervisory signals for\ndownstream 3D and 4D reconstruction. These multi-view images are used to\noptimize a 3D Gaussian point cloud, which is further extended into the temporal\ndomain via a lightweight deformation network. Our method effectively enhances\ntemporal consistency, geometric fidelity, and visual realism, addressing key\nchallenges in motion discontinuity and background degradation that affect prior\n4D GS-based methods. Extensive experiments on the Objaverse dataset demonstrate\nthat MVG4D outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in CLIP-I, PSNR, FVD, and\ntime efficiency.

        "title": "ViGText: Deepfake Image Detection with Vision-Language Model Explanations and Graph Neural Networks",
        "summary": "The rapid rise of deepfake technology, which produces realistic but\nfraudulent digital content, threatens the authenticity of media. Traditional\ndeepfake detection approaches often struggle with sophisticated, customized\ndeepfakes, especially in terms of generalization and robustness against\nmalicious attacks. This paper introduces ViGText, a novel approach that\nintegrates images with Vision Large Language Model (VLLM) Text explanations\nwithin a Graph-based framework to improve deepfake detection. The novelty of\nViGText lies in its integration of detailed explanations with visual data, as\nit provides a more context-aware analysis than captions, which often lack\nspecificity and fail to reveal subtle inconsistencies. ViGText systematically\ndivides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates\nthem for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.\nThrough the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency\ndomains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to\ndetect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText\nsignificantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost\nwhen it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise\nfrom 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's\nsuperior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable\ndiffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in\nrecall compared to other deepfake detection approaches. When facing targeted\nattacks that exploit its graph-based architecture, ViGText limits\nclassification performance degradation to less than 4%. ViGText uses detailed\nvisual and textual analysis to set a new standard for detecting deepfakes,\nhelping ensure media authenticity and information integrity.",

        "summary": "Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target\ndomain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without\ntarget images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text\ndescription to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous\nachievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven\nmethods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly\nincrease adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on\ntext descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides\ndiverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a\nnovel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic\nimages. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like\nimages and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.\nWe then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the\ntarget domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style\nTransfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In\nparticular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain\nrepresentations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to\nindividual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing\nstate-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,\nparticularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high\nefficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.",

        "summary": "Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) is a promising score distillation\ntechnique that compresses pre-trained teacher diffusion models into efficient\none-step or multi-step student generators. Nevertheless, its reliance on the\nreverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization potentially induces mode\ncollapse (or mode-seeking) in certain applications. To circumvent this inherent\ndrawback, we propose Adversarial Distribution Matching (ADM), a novel framework\nthat leverages diffusion-based discriminators to align the latent predictions\nbetween real and fake score estimators for score distillation in an adversarial\nmanner. In the context of extremely challenging one-step distillation, we\nfurther improve the pre-trained generator by adversarial distillation with\nhybrid discriminators in both latent and pixel spaces. Different from the mean\nsquared error used in DMD2 pre-training, our method incorporates the\ndistributional loss on ODE pairs collected from the teacher model, and thus\nproviding a better initialization for score distillation fine-tuning in the\nnext stage. By combining the adversarial distillation pre-training with ADM\nfine-tuning into a unified pipeline termed DMDX, our proposed method achieves\nsuperior one-step performance on SDXL compared to DMD2 while consuming less GPU\ntime. Additional experiments that apply multi-step ADM distillation on\nSD3-Medium, SD3.5-Large, and CogVideoX set a new benchmark towards efficient\nimage and video synthesis.",

Morph Attack Detection (MAD) can be\nused to detect a morph, but does not reveal the constituent images. Demorphing\n- the process of deducing the constituent images - is thus vital to provide\nadditional evidence about a morph. Existing demorphing methods suffer from the\nmorph replication problem, where the outputs tend to look very similar to the\nmorph itself, or assume that train and test morphs are generated using the same\nmorph technique. The proposed method overcomes these issues. The method\ndecomposes a morph in latent space allowing it to demorph images created from\nunseen morph techniques and face styles.

Specifically, every video and its audio is described across three\nhierarchical layers (factual, abstract, and intent), progressing from surface\nto depth.

We design\nhybrid-cognitive retrieval experiments, scored by multi-level retrieval\nmetrics, to appropriately assess deep video comprehension. Evaluation results\nfor models (e.g., InternVideo, VAST, UMT-L) are released.

To\naddress this, we propose a novel 3D cross-modal keypoint descriptor for MRI-iUS\nmatching and registration. Our approach employs a patient-specific\nmatching-by-synthesis approach, generating synthetic iUS volumes from\npreoperative MRI. This enables supervised contrastive training to learn a\nshared descriptor space.\n  A probabilistic keypoint detection strategy is then employed to identify\nanatomically salient and modality-consistent locations. During training, a\ncurriculum-based triplet loss with dynamic hard negative mining is used to\nlearn descriptors that are i) robust to iUS artifacts such as speckle noise and\nlimited coverage, and ii) rotation-invariant . At inference, the method detects\nkeypoints in MR and real iUS images and identifies sparse matches, which are\nthen used to perform rigid registration. Our approach is evaluated using 3D\nMRI-iUS pairs from the ReMIND dataset. Experiments show that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art keypoint matching methods across 11 patients, with\nan average precision of $69.8\\%$. For image registration, our method achieves a\ncompetitive mean Target Registration Error of 2.39 mm on the ReMIND2Reg\nbenchmark.\n  Compared to existing iUS-MR registration approach, our framework is\ninterpretable, requires no manual initialization, and shows robustness to iUS\nfield-of-view variation.

In this paper, we address this gap.\nFocusing on concept probing in the context of image classification tasks, we\ninvestigate the effect of the data used to train probing models on their\nperformance. We also make available concept labels for two widely used\ndatasets.",

        "summary": "Scaling visual generation models is essential for real-world content\ncreation, yet requires substantial training and computational expenses.\nAlternatively, test-time scaling has garnered growing attention due to resource\nefficiency and promising performance. In this work, we present TTS-VAR, the\nfirst general test-time scaling framework for visual auto-regressive (VAR)\nmodels, modeling the generation process as a path searching problem. To\ndynamically balance computational efficiency with exploration capacity, we\nfirst introduce an adaptive descending batch size schedule throughout the\ncausal generation process. Besides, inspired by VAR's hierarchical\ncoarse-to-fine multi-scale generation, our framework integrates two key\ncomponents: (i) At coarse scales, we observe that generated tokens are hard for\nevaluation, possibly leading to erroneous acceptance of inferior samples or\nrejection of superior samples. Noticing that the coarse scales contain\nsufficient structural information, we propose clustering-based diversity\nsearch. It preserves structural variety through semantic feature clustering,\nenabling later selection on samples with higher potential. (ii) In fine scales,\nresampling-based potential selection prioritizes promising candidates using\npotential scores, which are defined as reward functions incorporating\nmulti-scale generation history. Experiments on the powerful VAR model Infinity\nshow a notable 8.7% GenEval score improvement (from 0.69 to 0.75). Key insights\nreveal that early-stage structural features effectively influence final\nquality, and resampling efficacy varies across generation scales.

This substantial spatio-temporal gap\ncomplicates efforts to achieve fine-grained intention-oriented control in\nvideo. Towards this end, we propose a novel IntentVCNet that unifies the\ntemporal and spatial understanding knowledge inherent in LVLMs to bridge the\nspatio-temporal gap from both prompting and model perspectives.

This paper introduces a benchmark, PDB-Eval, for a detailed\nunderstanding of Personalized Driver Behavior, and aligning Large Multimodal\nModels (MLLMs) with driving comprehension and reasoning. Our benchmark consists\nof two main components, PDB-X and PDB-QA. PDB-X can evaluate MLLMs'\nunderstanding of temporal driving scenes.

As a generic learning task for generative models like\nMLLMs, PDB-QA can bridge the domain gap without harming MLLMs'\ngeneralizability. Our evaluation indicates that fine-tuning MLLMs on\nfine-grained descriptions and explanations can effectively bridge the gap\nbetween MLLMs and the driving domain, which improves zero-shot performance on\nquestion-answering tasks by up to 73.2%.

We address two key challenges: 1.\nAlmost all HPE datasets suffer from incorrect and inaccurate pose annotations.\nHence, we generated a precise and consistent 2D head pose dataset for our\ntraining set by rotating 3D head models for a fixed set of poses and rendering\nthe corresponding 2D images. 2. We achieved real-time performance with limited\ntraining data as our method accurately captures the nature of rotation of an\nobject from facial landmarks. Once the underlying manifold for rotation around\neach axis is learned, the model is very fast in predicting unseen data. Our\ntraining and testing code is available online along with our trained models:\nhttps: //github.com/MahdiGhafoorian/NLML_HPE.",

        "summary": "Acquiring and annotating large datasets in ultrasound imaging is challenging\ndue to low contrast, high noise, and susceptibility to artefacts. This process\nrequires significant time and clinical expertise. Self-supervised learning\n(SSL) offers a promising solution by leveraging unlabelled data to learn useful\nrepresentations, enabling improved segmentation performance when annotated data\nis limited. Recent state-of-the-art developments in SSL for video data include\nV-JEPA, a framework solely based on feature prediction, avoiding pixel level\nreconstruction or negative samples. We hypothesise that V-JEPA is well-suited\nto ultrasound imaging, as it is less sensitive to noisy pixel-level detail\nwhile effectively leveraging temporal information. To the best of our\nknowledge, this is the first study to adopt V-JEPA for ultrasound video data.\nSimilar to other patch-based masking SSL techniques such as VideoMAE, V-JEPA is\nwell-suited to ViT-based models. However, ViTs can underperform on small\nmedical datasets due to lack of inductive biases, limited spatial locality and\nabsence of hierarchical feature learning. To improve locality understanding, we\npropose a novel 3D localisation auxiliary task to improve locality in ViT\nrepresentations during V-JEPA pre-training. Our results show V-JEPA with our\nauxiliary task improves segmentation performance significantly across various\nfrozen encoder configurations, with gains up to 3.4\\% using 100\\% and up to\n8.35\\% using only 10\\% of the training data.",

This task requires estimating multiple material\nmaps and usually relies on the constraint of rendering result. The absence of\nconstraints on the material maps makes inverse rendering an ill-posed task.\nPrevious works alleviated this problem by building material dataset for\ntraining, but their simplified material data and rendering equation lead to\nrendering results with limited realism, especially that of skin. To further\nalleviate this problem, we construct a higher-quality dataset (OpenHumanBRDF)\nbased on scanned real data and statistical material data. In addition to the\nnormal, diffuse albedo, roughness, specular albedo, we produce displacement and\nsubsurface scattering to enhance the realism of rendering results, especially\nfor the skin. With the increase in prediction tasks for more materials, using\nan end-to-end model as in the previous work struggles to balance the importance\namong various material maps, and leads to model underfitting. Therefore, we\ndesign a model (HumanMaterial) with progressive training strategy to make full\nuse of the supervision information of the material maps and improve the\nperformance of material estimation. HumanMaterial first obtain the initial\nmaterial results via three prior models, and then refine the results by a\nfinetuning model. Prior models estimate different material maps, and each map\nhas different significance for rendering results. Thus, we design a Controlled\nPBR Rendering (CPR) loss, which enhances the importance of the materials to be\noptimized during the training of prior models. Extensive experiments on\nOpenHumanBRDF dataset and real data demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-image synthesis largely benefit from sophisticated\nsampling strategies and classifier-free guidance (CFG) to ensure high-quality\ngeneration. However, CFG's reliance on two forward passes, especially when\ncombined with intricate sampling algorithms, results in prohibitively high\ninference costs. To address this, we introduce TeEFusion (\\textbf{Te}xt\n\\textbf{E}mbeddings \\textbf{Fusion}), a novel and efficient distillation method\nthat directly incorporates the guidance magnitude into the text embeddings and\ndistills the teacher model's complex sampling strategy. By simply fusing\nconditional and unconditional text embeddings using linear operations,\nTeEFusion reconstructs the desired guidance without adding extra parameters,\nsimultaneously enabling the student model to learn from the teacher's output\nproduced via its sophisticated sampling approach. Extensive experiments on\nstate-of-the-art models such as SD3 demonstrate that our method allows the\nstudent to closely mimic the teacher's performance with a far simpler and more\nefficient sampling strategy. Consequently, the student model achieves inference\nspeeds up to 6$\\times$ faster than the teacher model, while maintaining image\nquality at levels comparable to those obtained through the teacher's complex\nsampling approach.

To address this, we propose GeoAvatar, a framework for adaptive\ngeometrical Gaussian Splatting. GeoAvatar leverages Adaptive Pre-allocation\nStage (APS), an unsupervised method that segments Gaussians into rigid and\nflexible sets for adaptive offset regularization. Then, based on mouth anatomy\nand dynamics, we introduce a novel mouth structure and the part-wise\ndeformation strategy to enhance the animation fidelity of the mouth. Finally,\nwe propose a regularization loss for precise rigging between Gaussians and 3DMM\nfaces. Moreover, we release DynamicFace, a video dataset with highly expressive\nfacial motions.

        "summary": "Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the visibility of degraded images\nto better align with human visual perception. While diffusion-based methods\nhave shown promising performance due to their strong generative capabilities.\nHowever, their unidirectional modelling of degradation often struggles to\ncapture the complexity of real-world degradation patterns, leading to\nstructural inconsistencies and pixel misalignments. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a bidirectional diffusion optimization mechanism that\njointly models the degradation processes of both low-light and normal-light\nimages, enabling more precise degradation parameter matching and enhancing\ngeneration quality. Specifically, we perform bidirectional diffusion-from\nlow-to-normal light and from normal-to-low light during training and introduce\nan adaptive feature interaction block (AFI) to refine feature representation.\nBy leveraging the complementarity between these two paths, our approach imposes\nan implicit symmetry constraint on illumination attenuation and noise\ndistribution, facilitating consistent degradation learning and improving the\nmodels ability to perceive illumination and detail degradation. Additionally,\nwe design a reflection-aware correction module (RACM) to guide color\nrestoration post-denoising and suppress overexposed regions, ensuring content\nconsistency and generating high-quality images that align with human visual\nperception. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and\nqualitative evaluations while generalizing effectively to diverse degradation\nscenarios.

As the first\nattempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation,\nTextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS\nsegmentation.

This limitation hinders their effectiveness\nin complex lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose VLM-IMI, a novel\nframework that leverages large vision-language models (VLMs) with iterative and\nmanual instructions (IMIs) for LLIE. VLM-IMI incorporates textual descriptions\nof the desired normal-light content as enhancement cues, enabling semantically\ninformed restoration. To effectively integrate cross-modal priors, we introduce\nan instruction prior fusion module, which dynamically aligns and fuses image\nand text features, promoting the generation of detailed and semantically\ncoherent outputs. During inference, we adopt an iterative and manual\ninstruction strategy to refine textual instructions, progressively improving\nvisual quality. This refinement enhances structural fidelity, semantic\nalignment, and the recovery of fine details under extremely low-light\nconditions. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that\nVLM-IMI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and\nperceptual quality.

However, current models struggle to generate longer videos with coherent\nscene transitions, primarily because they cannot infer when a transition is\nneeded from the prompt. Most open-source models are trained on datasets\nconsisting of single-scene video clips, which limits their capacity to learn\nand respond to prompts requiring multiple scenes. Developing scene transition\nawareness is essential for multi-scene generation, as it allows models to\nidentify and segment videos into distinct clips by accurately detecting\ntransitions.\n  To address this, we propose the \\textbf{Transition-Aware Video} (TAV)\ndataset, which consists of preprocessed video clips with multiple scene\ntransitions. Our experiment shows that post-training on the \\textbf{TAV}\ndataset improves prompt-based scene transition understanding, narrows the gap\nbetween required and generated scenes, and maintains image quality.",

        "summary": "Inference-time steering methods offer a lightweight alternative to\nfine-tuning large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) by\nmodifying internal activations at test time without updating model weights.\nHowever, most existing approaches rely on fixed, global intervention vectors,\noverlook the causal influence of individual input tokens, and fail to leverage\ninformative gradients from the model's logits, particularly in multimodal\nsettings where visual and textual inputs contribute unevenly. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During\ninference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by\ntoken-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve\nrepresentational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.",

In this work, we propose a deep learning procedure called\nDual-Energy Decomposition Model-based Diffusion (DEcomp-MoD) for quantitative\nmaterial decomposition which directly converts the DECT projection data into\nmaterial images. The algorithm is based on incorporating the knowledge of the\nspectral DECT model into the deep learning training loss and combining a\nscore-based denoising diffusion learned prior in the material image domain.\nImportantly the inference optimization loss takes as inputs directly the\nsinogram and converts to material images through a model-based conditional\ndiffusion model which guarantees consistency of the results. We evaluate the\nperformance with both quantitative and qualitative estimation of the proposed\nDEcomp-MoD method on synthetic DECT sinograms from the low-dose AAPM dataset.\nFinally, we show that DEcomp-MoD outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised\nscore-based model and supervised deep learning networks, with the potential to\nbe deployed for clinical diagnosis.",

        "summary": "Affine Grassmannian has been favored for expressing proximity between lines\nand planes due to its theoretical exactness in measuring distances among\nfeatures. Despite this advantage, the existing method can only measure the\nproximity without yielding the distance as an explicit function of rigid body\ntransformation. Thus, an optimizable distance function on the manifold has\nremained underdeveloped, stifling its application in registration problems.\nThis paper is the first to explicitly derive an optimizable cost function\nbetween two Grassmannian features with respect to rigid body transformation\n($\\mathbf{R}$ and $\\mathbf{t}$). Specifically, we present a rigorous\nmathematical proof demonstrating that the bases of high-dimensional linear\nsubspaces can serve as an explicit representation of the cost. Finally, we\npropose an optimizable cost function based on the transformed bases that can be\napplied to the registration problem of any affine subspace. Compared to vector\nparameter-based approaches, our method is able to find a globally optimal\nsolution by directly minimizing the geodesic distance which is agnostic to\nrepresentation ambiguity. The resulting cost function and its extension to the\ninlier-set maximizing \\ac{BnB} solver have been demonstrated to improve the\nconvergence of existing solutions or outperform them in various computer vision\ntasks.

Most current inpainting methods favor\nslice-wise 2D models for their high in-plane fidelity, but their independence\nacross slices produces discontinuities in the volume.

We\naddress these limitations with a hierarchical diffusion framework by replacing\ndirect 3D modeling with two perpendicular coarse-to-fine 2D stages. An axial\ndiffusion model first yields a coarse, globally consistent inpainting; a\ncoronal diffusion model then refines anatomical details. By combining\nperpendicular spatial views with adaptive resampling, our method balances data\nefficiency and volumetric consistency.

Current methods for 3D software generation\nusually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control\nspecific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to\nhandle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world.\nTo address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel\nrequirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal\ntraceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis\nis built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a\ngranular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural\nlanguage requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a\ncomprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of\n3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification\nlanguage capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D\nsoftware synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis\nenables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic\nconstraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis\naccurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90%\nof hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously.\nFurthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual\nevaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.",

        "summary": "We introduce SafeWork-R1, a cutting-edge multimodal reasoning model that\ndemonstrates the coevolution of capabilities and safety. It is developed by our\nproposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive,\nsafety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of\nmulti-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that\nsimply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop\nintrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety\n`aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of\n$46.54\\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks\nwithout compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety\nperformance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude\nOpus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct\ninference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism,\nenforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop\nSafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and\nSafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B. All resulting models demonstrate that safety and\ncapability can co-evolve synergistically, highlighting the generalizability of\nour framework in building robust, reliable, and trustworthy general-purpose AI.",

        "summary": "In the medical image analysis field, precise quantification of curve\ntortuosity plays a critical role in the auxiliary diagnosis and pathological\nassessment of various diseases. In this study, we propose a novel framework for\ntortuosity quantification and demonstrate its effectiveness through the\nevaluation of meibomian gland atrophy uniformity,serving as a representative\napplication scenario.\n  We introduce an information entropy-based tortuosity quantification framework\nthat integrates probability modeling with entropy theory and incorporates\ndomain transformation of curve data. Unlike traditional methods such as\ncurvature or arc-chord ratio, this approach evaluates the tortuosity of a\ntarget curve by comparing it to a designated reference curve. Consequently, it\nis more suitable for tortuosity assessment tasks in medical data where\nbiologically plausible reference curves are available, providing a more robust\nand objective evaluation metric without relying on idealized straight-line\ncomparisons.\n  First, we conducted numerical simulation experiments to preliminarily assess\nthe stability and validity of the method. Subsequently, the framework was\napplied to quantify the spatial uniformity of meibomian gland atrophy and to\nanalyze the difference in this uniformity between \\textit{Demodex}-negative and\n\\textit{Demodex}-positive patient groups. The results demonstrated a\nsignificant difference in tortuosity-based uniformity between the two groups,\nwith an area under the curve of 0.8768, sensitivity of 0.75, and specificity of\n0.93. These findings highlight the clinical utility of the proposed framework\nin curve tortuosity analysis and its potential as a generalizable tool for\nquantitative morphological evaluation in medical diagnostics.",

Automated detection of\nchicken carcasses on processing lines is vital for quality control, food\nsafety, and operational efficiency in slaughterhouses and poultry processing\nplants. However, developing robust deep learning models for tasks like instance\nsegmentation in these fast-paced industrial environments is often hampered by\nthe need for laborious acquisition and annotation of large-scale real-world\nimage datasets. We present the first pipeline generating photo-realistic,\nautomatically labeled synthetic images of chicken carcasses. We also introduce\na new benchmark dataset containing 300 annotated real-world images, curated\nspecifically for poultry segmentation research. Using these datasets, this\nstudy investigates the efficacy of synthetic data and automatic data annotation\nto enhance the instance segmentation of chicken carcasses, particularly when\nreal annotated data from the processing line is scarce. A small real dataset\nwith varying proportions of synthetic images was evaluated in prominent\ninstance segmentation models. Results show that synthetic data significantly\nboosts segmentation performance for chicken carcasses across all models. This\nresearch underscores the value of synthetic data augmentation as a viable and\neffective strategy to mitigate data scarcity, reduce manual annotation efforts,\nand advance the development of robust AI-driven automated detection systems for\nchicken carcasses in the poultry processing industry.",

These ice clouds can\nalter Earth's radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of\naviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail\nformation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality\nof atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex\nprocesses like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence.\nObservational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras,\ncould be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing\ndatasets don't explore all aspect of contrail dynamics and formation: they\ntypically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their\nsource flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible\nCamera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set of contrails recorded\nwith a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is\nindividually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its\nlifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24,228 frames) and\nincludes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As\nreference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail\nanalysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic\nsegmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual\ncontrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By\nproviding high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for\nmodel evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will\nfacilitate better calibration of physical models.

The synergistic\nreasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation\nModels (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.\nNevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic\ngranularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,\n(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address\nthese challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for\nsemantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and\nMLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs\nhierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,\nthe framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which\ninteract with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from\nnatural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level\nextraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are\nencoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive\nbehavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world\nexperiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical\nlab environments.

Current 3D TTA methods often rely on computationally\nexpensive spatial-domain optimizations and may require additional training\ndata. In contrast, we propose Graph Spectral Domain Test-Time Adaptation\n(GSDTTA), a novel approach for 3D point cloud classification that shifts\nadaptation to the graph spectral domain, enabling more efficient adaptation by\ncapturing global structural properties with fewer parameters. Point clouds in\ntarget domain are represented as outlier-aware graphs and transformed into\ngraph spectral domain by Graph Fourier Transform (GFT). For efficiency,\nadaptation is performed by optimizing only the lowest 10% of frequency\ncomponents, which capture the majority of the point cloud's energy. An inverse\nGFT (IGFT) is then applied to reconstruct the adapted point cloud with the\ngraph spectral-driven point shift. This process is enhanced by an\neigenmap-guided self-training strategy that iteratively refines both the\nspectral adjustments and the model parameters.

        "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a core technique for 3D\nrepresentation. Its effectiveness largely depends on precise camera poses and\naccurate point cloud initialization, which are often derived from pretrained\nMulti-View Stereo (MVS) models. However, in unposed reconstruction task from\nhundreds of outdoor images, existing MVS models may struggle with memory limits\nand lose accuracy as the number of input images grows. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a novel unposed 3DGS reconstruction framework that\nintegrates pretrained MVS priors with the probabilistic Procrustes mapping\nstrategy. The method partitions input images into subsets, maps submaps into a\nglobal space, and jointly optimizes geometry and poses with 3DGS. Technically,\nwe formulate the mapping of tens of millions of point clouds as a probabilistic\nProcrustes problem and solve a closed-form alignment. By employing\nprobabilistic coupling along with a soft dustbin mechanism to reject uncertain\ncorrespondences, our method globally aligns point clouds and poses within\nminutes across hundreds of images. Moreover, we propose a joint optimization\nframework for 3DGS and camera poses. It constructs Gaussians from\nconfidence-aware anchor points and integrates 3DGS differentiable rendering\nwith an analytical Jacobian to jointly refine scene and poses, enabling\naccurate reconstruction and pose estimation. Experiments on Waymo and KITTI\ndatasets show that our method achieves accurate reconstruction from unposed\nimage sequences, setting a new state of the art for unposed 3DGS\nreconstruction.",

However, the\nreliability of these online-generated maps remains uncertain. While\nincorporating map uncertainty into downstream trajectory prediction tasks has\nshown potential for performance improvements, current strategies provide\nlimited insights into the specific scenarios where this uncertainty is\nbeneficial. In this work, we first analyze the driving scenarios in which\nmapping uncertainty has the greatest positive impact on trajectory prediction\nand identify a critical, previously overlooked factor: the agent's kinematic\nstate. Building on these insights, we propose a novel Proprioceptive Scenario\nGating that adaptively integrates map uncertainty into trajectory prediction\nbased on forecasts of the ego vehicle's future kinematics. This lightweight,\nself-supervised approach enhances the synergy between online mapping and\ntrajectory prediction, providing interpretability around where uncertainty is\nadvantageous and outperforming previous integration methods.

However, these\napproaches often rely on pre-defined assumptions about adversarial tactics,\nlimiting their adaptability in dynamic 3D settings. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce Reinforced Embodied Active Defense (Rein-EAD), a\nproactive defense framework that leverages adaptive exploration and interaction\nwith the environment to improve perception robustness in 3D adversarial\ncontexts. By implementing a multi-step objective that balances immediate\nprediction accuracy with predictive entropy minimization, Rein-EAD optimizes\ndefense strategies over a multi-step horizon. Additionally, Rein-EAD involves\nan uncertainty-oriented reward-shaping mechanism that facilitates efficient\npolicy updates, thereby reducing computational overhead and supporting\nreal-world applicability without the need for differentiable environments.\nComprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Rein-EAD, demonstrating\na substantial reduction in attack success rates while preserving standard\naccuracy across diverse tasks.

        "summary": "In recent years, foundation models for monocular depth estimation have\nreceived increasing attention. Current methods mainly address typical daylight\nconditions, but their effectiveness notably decreases in low-light\nenvironments. There is a lack of robust foundational models for monocular depth\nestimation specifically designed for low-light scenarios. This largely stems\nfrom the absence of large-scale, high-quality paired depth datasets for\nlow-light conditions and the effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)\nstrategy. To address these challenges, we propose DepthDark, a robust\nfoundation model for low-light monocular depth estimation. We first introduce a\nflare-simulation module and a noise-simulation module to accurately simulate\nthe imaging process under nighttime conditions, producing high-quality paired\ndepth datasets for low-light conditions. Additionally, we present an effective\nlow-light PEFT strategy that utilizes illumination guidance and multiscale\nfeature fusion to enhance the model's capability in low-light environments. Our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation performance on the\nchallenging nuScenes-Night and RobotCar-Night datasets, validating its\neffectiveness using limited training data and computing resources.",

However,\nour preliminary experiments indicate that directly applying this global-local\ndesign to the classic deblurring task hinders accurate visual restoration,\nprimarily due to the constrained global context understanding within local\nattention. To address this, we introduce a channel-aware module that\ncomplements local attention, effectively integrating global context without\nsacrificing pixel-level precision. The proposed DiNAT-IR, a Transformer-based\narchitecture specifically designed for image restoration, achieves competitive\nresults across multiple benchmarks, offering a high-quality solution for\ndiverse low-level computer vision problems.",

However, practical\ndeployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging\nconditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we\npresent \\textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection,\ncomprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments\nincluding marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are\nharmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and\nsegmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation.\nWe systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering\nthe YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models.\nEvaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and\nmAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and\ninference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results\nhighlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M,\nas well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of\ndifferent architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a\nCLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment\nto dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each\ninput image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance\nwithout requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for\nreal-time applications.

This study used two sample\nMendelian randomization (MR) to explore causal relationships between dental\ntraits (periodontitis, dental caries) and lung cancer subtypes, and to assess\nmediation by pulmonary function. Genetic instruments were derived from the\nlargest available genome wide association studies, including data from 487,823\ndental caries and 506,594 periodontitis cases, as well as lung cancer data from\nthe Transdisciplinary Research of Cancer in Lung consortium. Inverse variance\nweighting was the main analytical method; lung function mediation was assessed\nusing the delta method. The results showed a significant positive causal effect\nof dental caries on overall lung cancer and its subtypes. Specifically, a one\nstandard deviation increase in dental caries incidence was associated with a\n188.0% higher risk of squamous cell lung carcinoma (OR = 2.880, 95% CI =\n1.236--6.713, p = 0.014), partially mediated by declines in forced vital\ncapacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), accounting\nfor 5.124% and 5.890% of the total effect.

Since\ntheir internal structures are not directly observable, robots must adaptively\nexplore and refine actions to generate successful manipulation trajectories.\nWhile existing works have attempted cross-category generalization in adaptive\narticulated object manipulation, two major challenges persist: (1) the\ngeometric diversity of real-world articulated objects complicates visual\nperception and understanding, and (2) variations in object functions and\nmechanisms hinder the development of a unified adaptive manipulation strategy.\nTo address these challenges, we propose AdaRPG, a novel framework that\nleverages foundation models to extract object parts, which exhibit greater\nlocal geometric similarity than entire objects, thereby enhancing visual\naffordance generalization for functional primitive skills. To support this, we\nconstruct a part-level affordance annotation dataset to train the affordance\nmodel.

In pursuit of determining the performance boundaries,\nresearchers employ large and expensive manual-labeling data for representation\nlearning.

In this paper, we first study the\nvariation in detection performance across several mainstream methods under\nvarious scarcity -- namely, the absence of high-quality infrared data -- that\nchallenge the prevailing theories about practical ISTD. To address this\nconcern, we introduce the Gaussian Agnostic Representation Learning.\nSpecifically, we propose the Gaussian Group Squeezer, leveraging Gaussian\nsampling and compression for non-uniform quantization. By exploiting a diverse\narray of training samples, we enhance the resilience of ISTD models against\nvarious challenges. Then, we introduce two-stage diffusion models for\nreal-world reconstruction. By aligning quantized signals closely with\nreal-world distributions, we significantly elevate the quality and fidelity of\nthe synthetic samples.

Because soil N has\nhigh spatial and temporal variability, it is desirable to accurately estimate\nthe N concentration of grapevine leaves and manage fertilization at the\nindividual plant level to optimally meet plant needs. In this study, we used\nin-field hyperspectral images with wavelengths ranging from $400 to 1000nm of\nfour different grapevine cultivars collected from distinct vineyards and over\ntwo growth stages during two growing seasons to develop models for predicting N\nconcentration at the leaf-level and canopy-level. After image processing, two\nfeature selection methods were employed to identify the optimal set of spectral\nbands that were responsive to leaf N concentrations. The selected spectral\nbands were used to train and test two different Machine Learning (ML) models,\nGradient Boosting and XGBoost, for predicting nitrogen concentrations. The\ncomparison of selected bands for both leaf-level and canopy-level datasets\nshowed that most of the spectral regions identified by the feature selection\nmethods were across both methods and the dataset types (leaf- and canopy-level\ndatasets), particularly in the key regions, 500-525nm, 650-690nm, 750-800nm,\nand 900-950nm. These findings indicated the robustness of these spectral\nregions for predicting nitrogen content. The results for N prediction\ndemonstrated that the ML model achieved an R square of 0.49 for canopy-level\ndata and an R square of 0.57 for leaf-level data, despite using different sets\nof selected spectral bands for each analysis level. The study demonstrated the\npotential of using in-field hyperspectral imaging and the use of spectral data\nin integrated feature selection and ML techniques to monitor N status in\nvineyards.",

        "summary": "This paper presents a novel deep learning-based approach for simultaneous age\nand gender classification from facial images, designed to enhance the\neffectiveness of targeted advertising campaigns. We propose a custom\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, optimized for both tasks,\nwhich leverages the inherent correlation between age and gender information\npresent in facial features. Unlike existing methods that often treat these\ntasks independently, our model learns shared representations, leading to\nimproved performance. The network is trained on a large, diverse dataset of\nfacial images, carefully pre-processed to ensure robustness against variations\nin lighting, pose, and image quality. Our experimental results demonstrate a\nsignificant improvement in gender classification accuracy, achieving 95%, and a\ncompetitive mean absolute error of 5.77 years for age estimation. Critically,\nwe analyze the performance across different age groups, identifying specific\nchallenges in accurately estimating the age of younger individuals. This\nanalysis reveals the need for targeted data augmentation and model refinement\nto address these biases. Furthermore, we explore the impact of different CNN\narchitectures and hyperparameter settings on the overall performance, providing\nvaluable insights for future research.",

        "title": "Towards Large Scale Geostatistical Methane Monitoring with Part-based Object Detection",
        "summary": "Object detection is one of the main applications of computer vision in remote\nsensing imagery. Despite its increasing availability, the sheer volume of\nremote sensing data poses a challenge when detecting rare objects across large\ngeographic areas. Paradoxically, this common challenge is crucial to many\napplications, such as estimating environmental impact of certain human\nactivities at scale. In this paper, we propose to address the problem by\ninvestigating the methane production and emissions of bio-digesters in France.\nWe first introduce a novel dataset containing bio-digesters, with small\ntraining and validation sets, and a large test set with a high imbalance\ntowards observations without objects since such sites are rare. We develop a\npart-based method that considers essential bio-digester sub-elements to boost\ninitial detections. To this end, we apply our method to new, unseen regions to\nbuild an inventory of bio-digesters. We then compute geostatistical estimates\nof the quantity of methane produced that can be attributed to these\ninfrastructures in a given area at a given time.",

        "summary": "Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication plays a crucial role in autonomous\ndriving, enabling cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure. While\nsimulation has significantly contributed to various autonomous driving tasks,\nits potential for data generation and augmentation in V2X scenarios remains\nunderexplored. In this paper, we introduce CRUISE, a comprehensive\nreconstruction-and-synthesis framework designed for V2X driving environments.\nCRUISE employs decomposed Gaussian Splatting to accurately reconstruct\nreal-world scenes while supporting flexible editing. By decomposing dynamic\ntraffic participants into editable Gaussian representations, CRUISE allows for\nseamless modification and augmentation of driving scenes. Furthermore, the\nframework renders images from both ego-vehicle and infrastructure views,\nenabling large-scale V2X dataset augmentation for training and evaluation. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that: 1) CRUISE reconstructs real-world V2X\ndriving scenes with high fidelity; 2) using CRUISE improves 3D detection across\nego-vehicle, infrastructure, and cooperative views, as well as cooperative 3D\ntracking on the V2X-Seq benchmark; and 3) CRUISE effectively generates\nchallenging corner cases.",

        "summary": "The use of robotics, computer vision, and their applications is becoming\nincreasingly widespread in various fields, including medicine. Many face\ndetection algorithms have found applications in neurosurgery, ophthalmology,\nand plastic surgery. A common challenge in using these algorithms is variable\nlighting conditions and the flexibility of detection positions to identify and\nprecisely localize patients. The proposed experiment tests the MediaPipe\nalgorithm for detecting facial landmarks in a controlled setting, using a\nrobotic arm that automatically adjusts positions while the surgical light and\nthe phantom remain in a fixed position. The results of this study demonstrate\nthat the improved accuracy of facial landmark detection under surgical lighting\nsignificantly enhances the detection performance at larger yaw and pitch\nangles. The increase in standard deviation/dispersion occurs due to imprecise\ndetection of selected facial landmarks. This analysis allows for a discussion\non the potential integration of the MediaPipe algorithm into medical\nprocedures.",

        "summary": "Systematic mislabelling affecting specific subgroups (i.e., label bias) in\nmedical imaging datasets represents an understudied issue concerning the\nfairness of medical AI systems. In this work, we investigated how size and\nseparability of subgroups affected by label bias influence the learned features\nand performance of a deep learning model. Therefore, we trained deep learning\nmodels for binary tissue density classification using the EMory BrEast imaging\nDataset (EMBED), where label bias affected separable subgroups (based on\nimaging manufacturer) or non-separable \"pseudo-subgroups\". We found that\nsimulated subgroup label bias led to prominent shifts in the learned feature\nrepresentations of the models. Importantly, these shifts within the feature\nspace were dependent on both the relative size and the separability of the\nsubgroup affected by label bias. We also observed notable differences in\nsubgroup performance depending on whether a validation set with clean labels\nwas used to define the classification threshold for the model. For instance,\nwith label bias affecting the majority separable subgroup, the true positive\nrate for that subgroup fell from 0.898, when the validation set had clean\nlabels, to 0.518, when the validation set had biased labels. Our work\nrepresents a key contribution toward understanding the consequences of label\nbias on subgroup fairness in medical imaging AI.",

This project introduces an automated system\nfor real-time video analysis, using You Only Look Once (YOLO) object detection\nmodels to identify two key behaviours: basking and hunting. We trained five\nYOLO variants (v5, v7, v8, v11, v12) on a custom, publicly available dataset of\n1200 images, encompassing bearded dragons (600), heating lamps (500), and\ncrickets (100). YOLOv8s was selected as the optimal model due to its superior\nbalance of accuracy (mAP@0.5:0.95 = 0.855) and speed. The system processes\nvideo footage by extracting per-frame object coordinates, applying temporal\ninterpolation for continuity, and using rule-based logic to classify specific\nbehaviours. Basking detection proved reliable. However, hunting detection was\nless accurate, primarily due to weak cricket detection (mAP@0.5 = 0.392).\nFuture improvements will focus on enhancing cricket detection through expanded\ndatasets or specialised small-object detectors. This automated system offers a\nscalable solution for monitoring reptile behaviour in controlled environments,\nsignificantly improving research efficiency and data quality.",
