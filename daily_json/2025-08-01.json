To address the aforementioned problems,\nresearchers return to pixel space at the cost of complicated cascade pipelines\nand increased token complexity. In contrast to their efforts, we propose to\nmodel the patch-wise decoding with neural field and present a single-scale,\nsingle-stage, efficient, end-to-end solution, coined as pixel neural field\ndiffusion~(PixelNerd). Thanks to the efficient neural field representation in\nPixNerd, we directly achieved 2.15 FID on ImageNet $256\\times256$ and 2.84 FID\non ImageNet $512\\times512$ without any complex cascade pipeline or VAE. We also\nextend our PixNerd framework to text-to-image applications.

While deep learning models have advanced scanpath\nprediction, most existing approaches generate averaged behaviors, failing to\ncapture the variability of human visual exploration. In this work, we present\nScanDiff, a novel architecture that combines diffusion models with Vision\nTransformers to generate diverse and realistic scanpaths.

To address these challenges, we propose a Forward-Forward\n(FF) based gradient approximation-free training framework for Spiking Neural\nNetworks, which treats spiking activations as black-box modules, thereby\neliminating the need for gradient approximation while significantly reducing\ncomputational complexity. Furthermore, we introduce a class-aware complexity\nadaptation mechanism that dynamically optimizes the loss function based on\ninter-class difficulty metrics, enabling efficient allocation of network\nresources across different categories.

Accurate image\nregistration is essential for effective multi-source data fusion. However,\nexisting registration methods, often based on image translation in Euclidean\nspace, fail to handle cross-modal misalignment effectively, resulting in\nsuboptimal alignment and fusion quality. To overcome this limitation, we\nexplore image alignment in non-Euclidean space and propose a Hyperbolic Cycle\nAlignment Network (Hy-CycleAlign). To the best of our knowledge, Hy-CycleAlign\nis the first image registration method based on hyperbolic space. It introduces\na dual-path cross-modal cyclic registration framework, in which a forward\nregistration network aligns cross-modal inputs, while a backward registration\nnetwork reconstructs the original image, forming a closed-loop registration\nstructure with geometric consistency. Additionally, we design a Hyperbolic\nHierarchy Contrastive Alignment (H$^{2}$CA) module, which maps images into\nhyperbolic space and imposes registration constraints, effectively reducing\ninterference caused by modality discrepancies. We further analyze image\nregistration in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces, demonstrating that\nhyperbolic space enables more sensitive and effective multi-modal image\nregistration. Extensive experiments on misaligned multi-modal images\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in\nboth image alignment and fusion.

We introduce XSpecMesh, a quality-preserving acceleration method for\nauto-regressive mesh generation models. XSpecMesh employs a lightweight,\nmulti-head speculative decoding scheme to predict multiple tokens in parallel\nwithin a single forward pass, thereby accelerating inference. We further\npropose a verification and resampling strategy: the backbone model verifies\neach predicted token and resamples any tokens that do not meet the quality\ncriteria. In addition, we propose a distillation strategy that trains the\nlightweight decoding heads by distilling from the backbone model, encouraging\ntheir prediction distributions to align and improving the success rate of\nspeculative predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\nachieves a 1.7x speedup without sacrificing generation quality. Our code will\nbe released.",

        "summary": "Unlike popular solutions based on dense feature maps, Object-Centric Learning\n(OCL) represents visual scenes as sub-symbolic object-level feature vectors,\ntermed slots, which are highly versatile for tasks involving visual modalities.\nOCL typically aggregates object superpixels into slots by iteratively applying\ncompetitive cross attention, known as Slot Attention, with the slots as the\nquery. However, once initialized, these slots are reused naively, causing\nredundant slots to compete with informative ones for representing objects. This\noften results in objects being erroneously segmented into parts. Additionally,\nmainstream methods derive supervision signals solely from decoding slots into\nthe input's reconstruction, overlooking potential supervision based on internal\ninformation. To address these issues, we propose Slot Attention with\nre-Initialization and self-Distillation (DIAS): $\\emph{i)}$ We reduce\nredundancy in the aggregated slots and re-initialize extra aggregation to\nupdate the remaining slots; $\\emph{ii)}$ We drive the bad attention map at the\nfirst aggregation iteration to approximate the good at the last iteration to\nenable self-distillation.

The deformation field paradigm of 3D Gaussian splatting has\nachieved near-photorealistic results in video reconstruction due to the great\nrepresentation capability of deep deformation networks. However, in videos with\ncomplex motion and significant scale variations, deformation networks often\noverfit to irregular Gaussian trajectories, leading to suboptimal visual\nquality. Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for\nstatic scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic\ncontent. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity\nfield modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed\nFlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering\n(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a\nflow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and\nsize of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on\nmulti-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple\nreal-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not\nonly notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry\nartifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian\ntrajectories.",

However, current driving data is mainly collected by vehicles, which\nis expensive and inefficient. A potential solution lies in synthesizing data\nfrom real-world images. Recent advancements in 3D reconstruction demonstrate\nphotorealistic novel view synthesis, highlighting the potential of generating\ndriving data from images captured on the road. This paper introduces a novel\nmethod, I2V-GS, to transfer the Infrastructure view To the Vehicle view with\nGaussian Splatting. Reconstruction from sparse infrastructure viewpoints and\nrendering under large view transformations is a challenging problem. We adopt\nthe adaptive depth warp to generate dense training views. To further expand the\nrange of views, we employ a cascade strategy to inpaint warped images, which\nalso ensures inpainting content is consistent across views. To further ensure\nthe reliability of the diffusion model, we utilize the cross-view information\nto perform a confidenceguided optimization. Moreover, we introduce RoadSight, a\nmulti-modality, multi-view dataset from real scenarios in infrastructure views.\nTo our knowledge, I2V-GS is the first framework to generate autonomous driving\ndatasets with infrastructure-vehicle view transformation.

The main challenge lies in inferring unseen\nappearance and geometric details while ensuring 3D consistency and realism.\nMost previous methods rely on 2D diffusion models to synthesize unseen views;\nhowever, these generated views are sparse and inconsistent, resulting in\nunrealistic 3D artifacts and blurred appearance. To address these limitations,\nwe leverage a generative avatar model, that can generate diverse 3D avatars by\nsampling deformed Gaussians from a learned prior distribution. Due to the\nlimited amount of 3D training data such a 3D model alone cannot capture all\nimage details of unseen identities. Consequently, we integrate it as a prior,\nensuring 3D consistency by projecting input images into its latent space and\nenforcing additional 3D appearance and geometric constraints. Our novel\napproach formulates Gaussian avatar creation as a model inversion process by\nfitting the generative avatar to synthetic views from 2D diffusion models.

        "title": "H-RDT: Human Manipulation Enhanced Bimanual Robotic Manipulation",
        "summary": "Imitation learning for robotic manipulation faces a fundamental challenge:\nthe scarcity of large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent\nrobotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to\nincrease data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse\nmorphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified\ntraining challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics\nDiffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data\nto enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale\negocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations\nprovide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and\ncan benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training\nparadigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,\nand (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action\nencoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B\nparameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.\nExtensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,\nsingle-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and\nrobustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from\nscratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving\nsignificant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in\nsimulation and real-world experiments, respectively. The results validate our\ncore hypothesis that human manipulation data can serve as a powerful foundation\nfor learning bimanual robotic manipulation policies.",

        "summary": "3D data simulation aims to bridge the gap between simulated and real-captured\n3D data, which is a fundamental problem for real-world 3D visual tasks. Most 3D\ndata simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to\ncapture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning\nan implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,\nbut progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work\nexplores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called\nStable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial\nstage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and\nsynthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local\nregions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the\nsynthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where\ndiffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a\n3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data\nsimulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with\nthe 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances\nperformance in real-world 3D visual tasks.

        "summary": "The Federated Learning (FL) approach enables effective learning across\ndistributed systems, while preserving user data privacy. To date, research has\nprimarily focused on addressing statistical heterogeneity and communication\nefficiency, through which FL has achieved success in classification tasks.\nHowever, its application to non-classification tasks, such as human pose\nestimation, remains underexplored. This paper identifies and investigates a\ncritical issue termed ``resolution-drift,'' where performance degrades\nsignificantly due to resolution variability across clients. Unlike class-level\nheterogeneity, resolution drift highlights the importance of resolution as\nanother axis of not independent or identically distributed (non-IID) data. To\naddress this issue, we present resolution-adaptive federated learning (RAF), a\nmethod that leverages heatmap-based knowledge distillation. Through\nmulti-resolution knowledge distillation between higher-resolution outputs\n(teachers) and lower-resolution outputs (students), our approach enhances\nresolution robustness without overfitting. Extensive experiments and\ntheoretical analysis demonstrate that RAF not only effectively mitigates\nresolution drift and achieves significant performance improvements, but also\ncan be integrated seamlessly into existing FL frameworks. Furthermore, although\nthis paper focuses on human pose estimation, our t-SNE analysis reveals\ndistinct characteristics between classification and high-resolution\nrepresentation tasks, supporting the generalizability of RAF to other tasks\nthat rely on preserving spatial detail.",

These limitations hinder their\nability to distinguish nominal from anomalous inputs efficiently, consistently,\nand robustly. We propose a reconstruction-free OOD detection method that\nleverages the forward diffusion trajectories of a Stein score-based denoising\ndiffusion model (SBDDM). By capturing trajectory curvature via the estimated\nStein score, our approach enables accurate anomaly scoring with only five\ndiffusion steps. A single SBDDM pre-trained on a large, semantically aligned\nmedical dataset generalizes effectively across multiple Near-OOD and Far-OOD\nbenchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while drastically reducing\ncomputational cost during inference. Compared to existing methods, SBDDM\nachieves a relative improvement of up to 10.43% and 18.10% for Near-OOD and\nFar-OOD detection, making it a practical building block for real-time, reliable\ncomputer-aided diagnosis.",

In\nthis paper, we propose the UniEmo, a unified framework that seamlessly\nintegrates these two tasks. The key challenge lies in the abstract nature of\nemotions, necessitating the extraction of visual representations beneficial for\nboth tasks. To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding\nchain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale\nemotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.\nSimultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to\nguide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the\ndiversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce\nthe emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the\nfusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional\ngeneration guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint\ntraining allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the\nunderstanding part. Furthermore, we propose a novel data filtering algorithm to\nselect high-quality and diverse emotional images generated by the well-trained\nmodel, which explicitly feedback into the understanding part. Together, these\ngeneration-driven dual feedback processes enhance the model's understanding\ncapacity.

        "summary": "Although large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive\ncapabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning, their practical\napplications are still limited by massive model parameters and high\ncomputational costs. Recent efforts from natural language processing (NLP) have\nshown the effectiveness of layer pruning, offering a plausible training-free\ncompression solution. However, due to the modality divergence between vision\nand language, it is unclear whether these NLP techniques are still effective in\nLVLMs. In this paper, we empirically prove that directly applying these layer\npruning methods to LVLMs is ineffective. Through extensive experiments, we find\nthat non-essential vision-language (VL) tokens and inter-layer feature gaps\npose critical challenges to pruning layers in LVLMs. Based on these insights,\nwe propose a novel framework Short-LVLM (SVL) that can utilize important VL\ntokens and mitigate the layer-wise feature gaps. Notably, Short-LVLM not only\nachieves a superior trade-off between performance and efficiency but also\nexhibits several potential advantages, i.e., training-free, model-agnostic, and\nhighly compatible.

        "summary": "This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision\nby examining six influential papers. The analy- sis begins with foundational\narchitectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced\nresidual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable\neffective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.\nSubsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new\nparadigm by applying the Transformer ar- chitecture to sequences of image\npatches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale\nimage recogni- tion. Building on these visual representation backbones, we\ninvestigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are\nanalyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a\ngenerator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,\nLatent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative\nmethods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually\ncompressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater\ncomputational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image\ngeneration. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce\ndependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a\nstudent network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,\nyielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with\nMasked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design\nto reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective\nmethod for pre-training large-scale vision models.",

        "summary": "Speech-driven methods for portraits are figuratively known as \"Talkers\"\nbecause of their capability to synthesize speaking mouth shapes and facial\nmovements. Especially with the rapid development of the Text-to-Image (T2I)\nmodels, AI-Generated Talking Heads (AGTHs) have gradually become an emerging\ndigital human media. However, challenges persist regarding the quality of these\ntalkers and AGTHs they generate, and comprehensive studies addressing these\nissues remain limited. To address this gap, this paper presents the largest\nAGTH quality assessment dataset THQA-10K to date, which selects 12 prominent\nT2I models and 14 advanced talkers to generate AGTHs for 14 prompts. After\nexcluding instances where AGTH generation is unsuccessful, the THQA-10K dataset\ncontains 10,457 AGTHs. Then, volunteers are recruited to subjectively rate the\nAGTHs and give the corresponding distortion categories. In our analysis for\nsubjective experimental results, we evaluate the performance of talkers in\nterms of generalizability and quality, and also expose the distortions of\nexisting AGTHs. Finally, an objective quality assessment method based on the\nfirst frame, Y-T slice and tone-lip consistency is proposed. Experimental\nresults show that this method can achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance\nin AGTH quality assessment. The work is released at\nhttps://github.com/zyj-2000/Talker.",

        "summary": "Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, but\ndomain shift often leads to performance degradation when models are applied to\nunseen clinical domains. This challenge arises due to variations in imaging\nconditions, scanner types, and acquisition protocols, limiting the practical\ndeployment of segmentation models. Unlike natural images, medical images\ntypically exhibit consistent anatomical structures across patients, with\ndomain-specific variations mainly caused by imaging conditions. This unique\ncharacteristic makes medical image segmentation particularly challenging.\n  To address this challenge, we propose a domain generalization framework\ntailored for medical image segmentation. Our approach improves robustness to\ndomain-specific variations by introducing implicit feature perturbations guided\nby domain statistics. Specifically, we employ a learnable semantic direction\nselector and a covariance-based semantic intensity sampler to modulate\ndomain-variant features while preserving task-relevant anatomical consistency.\nFurthermore, we design an adaptive consistency constraint that is selectively\napplied only when feature adjustment leads to degraded segmentation\nperformance. This constraint encourages the adjusted features to align with the\noriginal predictions, thereby stabilizing feature selection and improving the\nreliability of the segmentation.\n  Extensive experiments on two public multi-center benchmarks show that our\nframework consistently outperforms existing domain generalization approaches,\nachieving robust and generalizable segmentation performance across diverse\nclinical domains.",

        "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated significant potential\nin complex scene understanding and action reasoning, leading to their\nincreasing adoption in end-to-end autonomous driving systems. However, the long\nvisual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current\nvisual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either\nvisual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor\nperformance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers\nconcentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that\nretaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for\neffective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel\nreconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for\nautonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner\ncalled ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style\npixel reconstruction. A novel adversarial foreground-background reconstruction\nstrategy is designed to train ReconPruner for the visual encoder of VLA models.\nOnce trained, ReconPruner can be seamlessly applied to different VLA models\nwith the same visual encoder without retraining. To train ReconPruner, we also\nintroduce a large-scale dataset called nuScenes-FG, consisting of 241K\nimage-mask pairs with annotated foreground regions.

        "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\ngenerating artistic content by learning from billions of images, including\npopular artworks. However, the fundamental question of how these models\ninternally represent concepts, such as content and style in paintings, remains\nunexplored. Traditional computer vision assumes content and style are\northogonal, but diffusion models receive no explicit guidance about this\ndistinction during training. In this work, we investigate how transformer-based\ntext-to-image diffusion models encode content and style concepts when\ngenerating artworks. We leverage cross-attention heatmaps to attribute pixels\nin generated images to specific prompt tokens, enabling us to isolate image\nregions influenced by content-describing versus style-describing tokens. Our\nfindings reveal that diffusion models demonstrate varying degrees of\ncontent-style separation depending on the specific artistic prompt and style\nrequested. In many cases, content tokens primarily influence object-related\nregions while style tokens affect background and texture areas, suggesting an\nemergent understanding of the content-style distinction. These insights\ncontribute to our understanding of how large-scale generative models internally\nrepresent complex artistic concepts without explicit supervision.

        "summary": "Recent advancements in Document Layout Analysis through Large Language Models\nand Multimodal Models have significantly improved layout detection. However,\ndespite these improvements, challenges remain in addressing critical structural\nerrors, such as region merging, splitting, and missing content. Conventional\nevaluation metrics like IoU and mAP, which focus primarily on spatial overlap,\nare insufficient for detecting these errors. To address this limitation, we\npropose Layout Error Detection (LED), a novel benchmark designed to evaluate\nthe structural robustness of document layout predictions. LED defines eight\nstandardized error types, and formulates three complementary tasks: error\nexistence detection, error type classification, and element-wise error type\nclassification. Furthermore, we construct LED-Dataset, a synthetic dataset\ngenerated by injecting realistic structural errors based on empirical\ndistributions from DLA models. Experimental results across a range of LMMs\nreveal that LED effectively differentiates structural understanding\ncapabilities, exposing modality biases and performance trade-offs not visible\nthrough traditional metrics.",

Recent work\nleverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to improve retrieval,\nespecially for long or complex query-candidate pairs. However, we observe that\nthe naive application of MLLMs, i.e., retrieval based on candidate likelihood,\nintroduces candidate prior bias, favoring candidates with inherently higher\npriors over those more relevant to the query. To this end, we propose a novel\nretrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),\nwhich leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to\ngenerate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.\nFurthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet\neffective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate\nprior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,\nour BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4\nR@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing\nquery-candidate relevance.

Previous CLIP-based unified methods\noften require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support\nreconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or\ndegradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a\ntwo-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively\nintegrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain\noriginal comprehension performance while achieving effective image\nreconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to\nconnect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and\nthe last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not\nonly enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in\ngeneration tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information\nin UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks,\nUniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark\nrespectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image\nediting, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark,\nsurpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1.

        "summary": "Feed-forward 3D modeling has emerged as a promising approach for rapid and\nhigh-quality 3D reconstruction. In particular, directly generating explicit 3D\nrepresentations, such as 3D Gaussian splatting, has attracted significant\nattention due to its fast and high-quality rendering, as well as numerous\napplications. However, many state-of-the-art methods, primarily based on\ntransformer architectures, suffer from severe scalability issues because they\nrely on full attention across image tokens from multiple input views, resulting\nin prohibitive computational costs as the number of views or image resolution\nincreases. Toward a scalable and efficient feed-forward 3D reconstruction, we\nintroduce an iterative Large 3D Reconstruction Model (iLRM) that generates 3D\nGaussian representations through an iterative refinement mechanism, guided by\nthree core principles: (1) decoupling the scene representation from input-view\nimages to enable compact 3D representations; (2) decomposing fully-attentional\nmulti-view interactions into a two-stage attention scheme to reduce\ncomputational costs; and (3) injecting high-resolution information at every\nlayer to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. Experimental results on widely\nused datasets, such as RE10K and DL3DV, demonstrate that iLRM outperforms\nexisting methods in both reconstruction quality and speed.

While AI-powered tools hold promise for\naccelerating medical image analysis, adoption of commercial medical AI products\nremains limited in low- and middle-income countries due to high license costs,\nproprietary software, and infrastructure demands. In this work, we investigate\nwhether the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can be adapted for low-cost,\nminimal-input 3D tumor segmentation in breast MRI. Using a single bounding box\nannotation on one slice, we propagate segmentation predictions across the 3D\nvolume using three different slice-wise tracking strategies: top-to-bottom,\nbottom-to-top, and center-outward. We evaluate these strategies across a large\ncohort of patients and find that center-outward propagation yields the most\nconsistent and accurate segmentations. Despite being a zero-shot model not\ntrained for volumetric medical data, SAM2 achieves strong segmentation\nperformance under minimal supervision. We further analyze how segmentation\nperformance relates to tumor size, location, and shape, identifying key failure\nmodes. Our results suggest that general-purpose foundation models such as SAM2\ncan support 3D medical image analysis with minimal supervision, offering an\naccessible and affordable alternative for resource-constrained settings.",

While traditional\nnumerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise\naccuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,\nwhich is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we\npropose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation\nmetric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent\ntwo-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image\ntransformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly\nintegrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal\nLoss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series\nmodality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.\nSATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures\nstructural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a\nfrequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast\nFourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that\nmeasures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal\nfeatures with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal\nfeature extractor and time-series image autoencoder.

        "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a\ndiffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into\ngenerating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the\nclean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying\ndefenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each\ncomponent, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to\nbe suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD\ninherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as\nin model robustness to some defenses.",

        "summary": "Motion retrieval is crucial for motion acquisition, offering superior\nprecision, realism, controllability, and editability compared to motion\ngeneration. Existing approaches leverage contrastive learning to construct a\nunified embedding space for motion retrieval from text or visual modality.\nHowever, these methods lack a more intuitive and user-friendly interaction mode\nand often overlook the sequential representation of most modalities for\nimproved retrieval performance. To address these limitations, we propose a\nframework that aligns four modalities -- text, audio, video, and motion --\nwithin a fine-grained joint embedding space, incorporating audio for the first\ntime in motion retrieval to enhance user immersion and convenience. This\nfine-grained space is achieved through a sequence-level contrastive learning\napproach, which captures critical details across modalities for better\nalignment. To evaluate our framework, we augment existing text-motion datasets\nwith synthetic but diverse audio recordings, creating two multi-modal motion\nretrieval datasets. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over\nstate-of-the-art methods across multiple sub-tasks, including an 10.16%\nimprovement in R@10 for text-to-motion retrieval and a 25.43% improvement in\nR@1 for video-to-motion retrieval on the HumanML3D dataset. Furthermore, our\nresults show that our 4-modal framework significantly outperforms its 3-modal\ncounterpart, underscoring the potential of multi-modal motion retrieval for\nadvancing motion acquisition.",

A valuable approach to studying\nthem requires accurate spatio-temporal information on land surface conditions.\nOne of the most important variables for assessing and understanding these\nphenomena is Land Surface Temperature (LST), which is derived from satellites\nand provides essential information about the thermal state of the Earth's\nsurface. However, satellite platforms inherently face a trade-off between\nspatial and temporal resolutions. To bridge this gap, we propose FuseTen, a\nnovel generative framework that produces daily LST observations at a fine 10 m\nspatial resolution by fusing spatio-temporal observations derived from\nSentinel-2, Landsat 8, and Terra MODIS. FuseTen employs a generative\narchitecture trained using an averaging-based supervision strategy grounded in\nphysical principles. It incorporates attention and normalization modules within\nthe fusion process and uses a PatchGAN discriminator to enforce realism.\nExperiments across multiple dates show that FuseTen outperforms linear\nbaselines, with an average 32.06% improvement in quantitative metrics and\n31.42% in visual fidelity.

        "summary": "Safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving and medical image\nanalysis, require extensive multimodal data for rigorous testing. Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a\ndiffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,\nmaintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically\nblending it with the surrounding tissue. Together, these methods demonstrate\nthat foundation models for reference-guided inpainting in natural images can be\nreadily adapted to diverse perceptual modalities, paving the way for the next\ngeneration of systems capable of constructing highly realistic, controllable\nand multimodal counterfactual scenarios.",

While these models excel at their designed forward tasks (e.g.,\ntext-to-image generation, audio-to-text transcription), their potential for\ninverse mappings remains largely unexplored. We propose an optimization-based\nframework to infer input characteristics from desired outputs, applying it\nbidirectionally across Text-Image (BLIP, Flux.1-dev) and Text-Audio\n(Whisper-Large-V3, Chatterbox-TTS) modalities.\n  Our central hypothesis posits that while optimization can guide models\ntowards inverse tasks, their multimodal latent spaces will not consistently\nsupport semantically meaningful and perceptually coherent inverse mappings.\nExperimental results consistently validate this hypothesis. We demonstrate that\nwhile optimization can force models to produce outputs that align textually\nwith targets (e.g., a text-to-image model generating an image that an image\ncaptioning model describes correctly, or an ASR model transcribing optimized\naudio accurately), the perceptual quality of these inversions is chaotic and\nincoherent. Furthermore, when attempting to infer the original semantic input\nfrom generative models, the reconstructed latent space embeddings frequently\nlack semantic interpretability, aligning with nonsensical vocabulary tokens.\n  These findings highlight a critical limitation. multimodal latent spaces,\nprimarily optimized for specific forward tasks, do not inherently possess the\nstructure required for robust and interpretable inverse mappings.

A controllable\nlevel-of-detail (LOD) strategy explicitly regulates Gaussian density under a\nuser-defined budget, enabling efficient training and rendering while\nmaintaining high visual fidelity. The appearance transformation module\nmitigates the negative effects of appearance inconsistencies across images\nwhile enabling flexible adjustments.

        "summary": "The proliferation of advanced tools for manipulating video has led to an arms\nrace, pitting those who wish to sow disinformation against those who want to\ndetect and expose it. Unfortunately, time favors the ill-intentioned in this\nrace, with fake videos growing increasingly difficult to distinguish from real\nones. At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those\nmanipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider\nauthentic (i.e., \"natural\") video. In this paper, we show how coding very\nsubtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat\nthis advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.\nOur approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under\ncoded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this\nwatermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit\nonly by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that\nour technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to\nsolving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content\ncreation problem at an information disadvantage. This is a promising avenue for\nprotecting high-stakes settings like public events and interviews, where the\ncontent on display is a likely target for manipulation, and while the\nillumination can be controlled, the cameras capturing video cannot.",

In this work, we introduce LesionGen, a\nclinically informed T2I-DPM framework for dermatology image synthesis.

        "summary": "As extreme heat events intensify due to climate change and urbanization,\ncities face increasing challenges in mitigating outdoor heat stress. While\ntraditional physical models such as SOLWEIG and ENVI-met provide detailed\nassessments of human-perceived heat exposure, their computational demands limit\nscalability for city-wide planning. In this study, we propose GSM-UTCI, a\nmultimodal deep learning framework designed to predict daytime average\nUniversal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) at 1-meter hyperlocal resolution. The\nmodel fuses surface morphology (nDSM), high-resolution land cover data, and\nhourly meteorological conditions using a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM)\narchitecture that dynamically conditions spatial features on atmospheric\ncontext. Trained on SOLWEIG-derived UTCI maps, GSM-UTCI achieves near-physical\naccuracy, with an R2 of 0.9151 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.41{\\deg}C,\nwhile reducing inference time from hours to under five minutes for an entire\ncity. To demonstrate its planning relevance, we apply GSM-UTCI to simulate\nsystematic landscape transformation scenarios in Philadelphia, replacing bare\nearth, grass, and impervious surfaces with tree canopy. Results show spatially\nheterogeneous but consistently strong cooling effects, with impervious-to-tree\nconversion producing the highest aggregated benefit (-4.18{\\deg}C average\nchange in UTCI across 270.7 km2). Tract-level bivariate analysis further\nreveals strong alignment between thermal reduction potential and land cover\nproportions. These findings underscore the utility of GSM-UTCI as a scalable,\nfine-grained decision support tool for urban climate adaptation, enabling\nscenario-based evaluation of greening strategies across diverse urban\nenvironments.",

        "summary": "Deep learning-based medical image segmentation techniques have shown\npromising results when evaluated based on conventional metrics such as the Dice\nscore or Intersection-over-Union. However, these fully automatic methods often\nfail to meet clinically acceptable accuracy, especially when topological\nconstraints should be observed, e.g., continuous boundaries or closed surfaces.\nIn medical image segmentation, the correctness of a segmentation in terms of\nthe required topological genus sometimes is even more important than the\npixel-wise accuracy. Existing topology-aware approaches commonly estimate and\nconstrain the topological structure via the concept of persistent homology\n(PH). However, these methods are difficult to implement for high dimensional\ndata due to their polynomial computational complexity. To overcome this\nproblem, we propose a novel and fast approach for topology-aware segmentation\nbased on the Euler Characteristic ($\\chi$). First, we propose a fast\nformulation for $\\chi$ computation in both 2D and 3D. The scalar $\\chi$ error\nbetween the prediction and ground-truth serves as the topological evaluation\nmetric. Then we estimate the spatial topology correctness of any segmentation\nnetwork via a so-called topological violation map, i.e., a detailed map that\nhighlights regions with $\\chi$ errors. Finally, the segmentation results from\nthe arbitrary network are refined based on the topological violation maps by a\ntopology-aware correction network. Our experiments are conducted on both 2D and\n3D datasets and show that our method can significantly improve topological\ncorrectness while preserving pixel-wise segmentation accuracy.",

Recent studies\ndemonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation\nto compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through\ndynamic variations in frequency energy. Furthermore, the emerging state space\nmodel called Mamba, enables efficient perception of motion cues in frame\nsequences due to its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated\nby this, we propose a novel visual camouflage Mamba (Vcamba) based on\nspatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial\nfeatures for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, we propose a receptive\nfield visual state space (RFVSS) module to extract multi-scale spatial features\nafter sequence modeling. For frequency learning, we introduce an adaptive\nfrequency component enhancement (AFE) module with a novel frequency-domain\nsequential scanning strategy to maintain semantic consistency.

To address these challenges, we\npropose 3D-R1, a foundation model that enhances the reasoning capabilities of\n3D VLMs. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality synthetic dataset with\nCoT, named Scene-30K, leveraging existing 3D-VL datasets and a data engine\nbased on Gemini 2.5 Pro.

        "title": "AGA: An adaptive group alignment framework for structured medical cross-modal representation learning",
        "summary": "Learning medical visual representations from paired images and reports is a\npromising direction in representation learning. However, current\nvision-language pretraining methods in the medical domain often simplify\nclinical reports into single entities or fragmented tokens, ignoring their\ninherent structure. In addition, contrastive learning frameworks typically\ndepend on large quantities of hard negative samples, which is impractical for\nsmall-scale medical datasets. To tackle these challenges, we propose Adaptive\nGrouped Alignment (AGA), a new framework that captures structured semantics\nfrom paired medical images and reports. AGA introduces a bidirectional grouping\nmechanism based on a sparse similarity matrix. For each image-report pair, we\ncompute fine-grained similarities between text tokens and image patches. Each\ntoken selects its top-matching patches to form a visual group, and each patch\nselects its most related tokens to form a language group. To enable adaptive\ngrouping, we design two threshold gating modules, called Language Grouped\nThreshold Gate and Vision Grouped Threshold Gate, which learn grouping\nthresholds dynamically. Group representations are computed as weighted averages\nbased on similarity scores. To align each token with its group representation,\nwe introduce an Instance Aware Group Alignment loss that operates within each\nimage-text pair, removing the need for external negatives. Finally, a\nBidirectional Cross-modal Grouped Alignment module is applied to enhance\nfine-grained alignment between visual and linguistic group representations.\nExtensive experiments on public and private datasets show that our method\nachieves strong performance on image-text retrieval and classification tasks\nunder both fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.",

Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN\nin terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12\nexhibits slightly better recall.

        "summary": "Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (SSCOD) aims to reduce reliance\non costly pixel-level annotations by leveraging limited annotated data and\nabundant unlabeled data. However, existing SSCOD methods based on\nTeacher-Student frameworks suffer from severe prediction bias and error\npropagation under scarce supervision, while their multi-network architectures\nincur high computational overhead and limited scalability. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose ST-SAM, a highly annotation-efficient yet concise\nframework that breaks away from conventional SSCOD constraints. Specifically,\nST-SAM employs Self-Training strategy that dynamically filters and expands\nhigh-confidence pseudo-labels to enhance a single-model architecture, thereby\nfundamentally circumventing inter-model prediction bias. Furthermore, by\ntransforming pseudo-labels into hybrid prompts containing domain-specific\nknowledge, ST-SAM effectively harnesses the Segment Anything Model's potential\nfor specialized tasks to mitigate error accumulation in self-training.\nExperiments on COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that ST-SAM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with only 1\\% labeled data, outperforming existing\nSSCOD methods and even matching fully supervised methods. Remarkably, ST-SAM\nrequires training only a single network, without relying on specific models or\nloss functions. This work establishes a new paradigm for annotation-efficient\nSSCOD.

        "summary": "Deep functional maps have recently emerged as a powerful tool for solving\nnon-rigid shape correspondence tasks. Methods that use this approach combine\nthe power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven\nlearning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods\nin this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and\nstill rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for\nfunctional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the\naccuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios\nwhere assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the\nfirst time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can\nbe replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative\nmodel of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative\nmodeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit\nthe resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth\nfunctional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the\nlearned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used\nstrategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of\nfunctional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation\nstrategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic\napproaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

        "summary": "In recent years, the demand for social robots has grown, requiring them to\nadapt their behaviors based on users' states. Accurately assessing user\nexperience (UX) in human-robot interaction (HRI) is crucial for achieving this\nadaptability. UX is a multi-faceted measure encompassing aspects such as\nsentiment and engagement, yet existing methods often focus on these\nindividually. This study proposes a UX estimation method for HRI by leveraging\nmultimodal social signals. We construct a UX dataset and develop a\nTransformer-based model that utilizes facial expressions and voice for\nestimation. Unlike conventional models that rely on momentary observations, our\napproach captures both short- and long-term interaction patterns using a\nmulti-instance learning framework. This enables the model to capture temporal\ndynamics in UX, providing a more holistic representation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms third-party human evaluators in UX\nestimation.",

        "summary": "Visual relation detection (VRD) is the task of identifying the relationships\nbetween objects in a scene. VRD models trained solely on relation detection\ndata struggle to generalize beyond the relations on which they are trained.\nWhile prompt tuning has been used to adapt vision-language models (VLMs) for\nVRD, it uses handcrafted prompts and struggles with novel or complex relations.\nWe argue that instruction tuning offers a more effective solution by\nfine-tuning VLMs on diverse instructional data. We thus introduce ART, an\nAdaptive Relation Tuning framework that adapts VLMs for VRD through instruction\ntuning and strategic instance selection. By converting VRD datasets into an\ninstruction tuning format and employing an adaptive sampling algorithm, ART\ndirects the VLM to focus on informative relations while maintaining\ngeneralizability. Specifically, we focus on the relation classification, where\nsubject-object boxes are given and the model predicts the predicate between\nthem. We tune on a held-in set and evaluate across multiple held-out datasets\nof varying complexity. Our approach strongly improves over its baselines and\ncan infer unseen relation concepts, a capability absent in mainstream VRD\nmethods. We demonstrate ART's practical value by using the predicted relations\nfor segmenting complex scenes.",

However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature\nconspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute\nrepresentation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To\novercome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared\ndataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex\nScenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k\nhigh-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a\nsignificant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex\nscenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to\nincorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise\nevaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance\nanalysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed\ndataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex\nenvironments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only\n35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410\ndataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and\nthe need for further advancements in UAV tracking research.

However, the current standard for tumor quantification through\nmanual segmentation of multi-parametric MRI is time-consuming, requires expert\nradiologists, and is often infeasible in under-resourced healthcare systems.\nThis problem is especially pronounced in low-income regions, where MRI scanners\nare of lower quality and radiology expertise is scarce, leading to incorrect\nsegmentation and quantification. In addition, the number of acquired MRI scans\nin Africa is typically small. To address these challenges, the BraTS-Lighthouse\n2025 Challenge focuses on robust tumor segmentation in sub-Saharan Africa\n(SSA), where resource constraints and image quality degradation introduce\nsignificant shifts. In this study, we present EMedNeXt -- an enhanced brain\ntumor segmentation framework based on MedNeXt V2 with deep supervision and\noptimized post-processing pipelines tailored for SSA. EMedNeXt introduces three\nkey contributions: a larger region of interest, an improved nnU-Net v2-based\narchitectural skeleton, and a robust model ensembling system. Evaluated on the\nhidden validation set, our solution achieved an average LesionWise DSC of 0.897\nwith an average LesionWise NSD of 0.541 and 0.84 at a tolerance of 0.5 mm and\n1.0 mm, respectively.",

        "summary": "Cranial nerves (CNs) play a crucial role in various essential functions of\nthe human brain, and mapping their pathways from diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides\nvaluable preoperative insights into the spatial relationships between\nindividual CNs and key tissues. However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed\nCN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN\npair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present\nwhat we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion\ntractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The\nCN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by\nmulti-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable\nclustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for\nmultiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50\nsubjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual\nexperiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence\nwith expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP\ndataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of\npituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8\nfiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,\noculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear\nnerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally. This work\ncontributes to the field of diffusion imaging by facilitating more efficient\nand automated mapping the pathways of multiple pairs of CNs, thereby enhancing\nthe analysis and understanding of complex brain structures through\nvisualization of their spatial relationships with nearby anatomy.",

        "summary": "Autonomous vehicles must react in milliseconds while reasoning about road\ngeometry and traffic intent to navigate complex situations. We introduce\nNovaDrive, a single-branch vision-language architecture that processes\nfront-camera images, HD-map tiles, LiDAR depth, and textual waypoints in a\nsingle branch. A lightweight, two-stage cross-attention block first aligns\nwaypoint tokens with the HD map, then refines attention over fine-grained image\nand depth patches. Coupled with a novel smoothness loss that discourages abrupt\nsteering and speed changes, this design eliminates the need for recurrent\nmemory. We fine-tune the top 15 layers of an 11B LLaMA-3.2 vision-language\nbackbone, enabling real-time inference. On the nuScenes / Waymo subset of the\nMD-NEX Outdoor benchmark, NovaDrive raises success rate to 84% (+4%), boosts\npath-efficiency (SPL) to 0.66 (+0.11), and reduces collision frequency from\n2.6% to 1.2% (-1.4%) relative to the previous state-of-the-art. Our ablations\nconfirm that waypoint tokens, partial VLM fine-tuning, and the cross-attention\nfusion each contribute the most to these gains.

To address this limitation,\nwe introduce a novel approach that embeds SMPL-X into a tangible entity capable\nof dynamic physical interactions with its surroundings.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D\nGaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale\nbenchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance\nunderstanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an\nend-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D\naffordance masks. SeqSplatNet employs a large language model that\nautoregressively generates text interleaved with special segmentation tokens,\nguiding a conditional decoder to produce the corresponding 3D mask. To handle\ncomplex scene geometry, we introduce a pre-training strategy, Conditional\nGeometric Reconstruction, where the model learns to reconstruct complete\naffordance region masks from known geometric observations, thereby building a\nrobust geometric prior. Furthermore, to resolve semantic ambiguities, we design\na feature injection mechanism that lifts rich semantic features from 2D Vision\nFoundation Models (VFM) and fuses them into the 3D decoder at multiple scales.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our method sets a new state-of-the-art\non our challenging benchmark, effectively advancing affordance reasoning from\nsingle-step interactions to complex, sequential tasks at the scene level.",

Deep learning-based\ncomputer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed and demonstrate\npromising performance on thin blood smear images. However, their clinical\ndeployment may be hindered by limited generalization across sites with varying\nconditions. Yet very few practical solutions have been proposed. In this work,\nwe investigate continual learning (CL) as a strategy to enhance the robustness\nof malaria CAD models to domain shifts. We frame the problem as a\ndomain-incremental learning scenario, where a YOLO-based object detector must\nadapt to new acquisition sites while retaining performance on previously seen\ndomains. We evaluate four CL strategies, two rehearsal-based and two\nregularization-based methods, on real-life conditions thanks to a multi-site\nclinical dataset of thin blood smear images. Our results suggest that CL, and\nrehearsal-based methods in particular, can significantly improve performance.\nThese findings highlight the potential of continual learning to support the\ndevelopment of deployable, field-ready CAD tools for malaria.",

With over 29 million stealer logs reported in 2024, manual\nanalysis and mitigation at scale are virtually unfeasible/unpractical. While\nmost research focuses on proactive malware detection, a significant gap remains\nin leveraging reactive analysis of stealer logs and their associated artifacts.\nSpecifically, infection artifacts such as screenshots, image captured at the\npoint of compromise, are largely overlooked by the current literature. This\npaper introduces a novel approach leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), more\nspecifically gpt-4o-mini, to analyze infection screenshots to extract potential\nIndicators of Compromise (IoCs), map infection vectors, and track campaigns.\nFocusing on the Aurora infostealer, we demonstrate how LLMs can process\nscreenshots to identify infection vectors, such as malicious URLs, installer\nfiles, and exploited software themes. Our method extracted 337 actionable URLs\nand 246 relevant files from 1000 screenshots, revealing key malware\ndistribution methods and social engineering tactics. By correlating extracted\nfilenames, URLs, and infection themes, we identified three distinct malware\ncampaigns, demonstrating the potential of LLM-driven analysis for uncovering\ninfection workflows and enhancing threat intelligence.

However, many current\nmethods focus on high accuracy at the expense of real-time processing needs. To\naddress this challenge of balancing accuracy and inference speed, we propose a\ndirectional pure 2D approach. Our method involves slicing 3D voxel features to\npreserve complete vertical geometric information. This strategy compensates for\nthe loss of height cues in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) representations, thereby\nmaintaining the integrity of the 3D geometric structure. By employing a\ndirectional attention mechanism, we efficiently extract geometric features from\ndifferent orientations, striking a balance between accuracy and computational\nefficiency. Experimental results highlight the significant advantages of our\napproach for autonomous driving. On the Occ3D-nuScenes, the proposed method\nachieves an mIoU of 39.3% and an inference speed of 27.7 FPS, effectively\nbalancing accuracy and efficiency.

Traditional\nmanual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may\nrequire road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based\ninfrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side\nLiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to\ndrive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need\nfor specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new\ntargetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features\nand a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side\npoint clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and\nestimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration\nfailures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as\nocclusions) and large differences in viewpoint. We evaluate MamV2XCalib on the\nV2X-Seq and TUMTraf-V2X real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness\nand robustness of our V2X-based automatic calibration approach. Compared to\nprevious LiDAR-camera methods designed for calibration on one car, our approach\nachieves better and more stable calibration performance in V2X scenarios with\nfewer parameters.

We leverage the dense geometric information and\ndifferentiable rasterization algorithm from 3DGS to learn robust feature\nrepresentations grounded in 3D. In particular, we align a 3D scale-aware\nfeature field and a 2D feature encoder in a common embedding space through a\ncontrastive framework. Using a 3D structure-informed clustering procedure, we\nfurther regularize the representation learning and seamlessly convert the\nfeatures to segmentations, which can be used for privacy-preserving visual\nlocalization. Pose refinement, which involves aligning either feature maps or\nsegmentations from a query image with those rendered from the GSFFs scene\nrepresentation, is used to achieve localization.

        "summary": "With the rapid growth of hyperspectral data archives in remote sensing (RS),\nthe need for efficient storage has become essential, driving significant\nattention toward learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) compression. However,\na comprehensive investigation of the individual and joint effects of spectral\nand spatial compression on learning-based HSI compression has not been\nthoroughly examined yet. Conducting such an analysis is crucial for\nunderstanding how the exploitation of spectral, spatial, and joint\nspatio-spectral redundancies affects HSI compression. To address this issue, we\npropose Adjustable Spatio-Spectral Hyperspectral Image Compression Network\n(HyCASS), a learning-based model designed for adjustable HSI compression in\nboth spectral and spatial dimensions. HyCASS consists of six main modules: 1)\nspectral encoder; 2) spatial encoder; 3) compression ratio (CR) adapter\nencoder; 4) CR adapter decoder; 5) spatial decoder; and 6) spectral decoder\nmodule. The modules employ convolutional layers and transformer blocks to\ncapture both short-range and long-range redundancies. Experimental results on\ntwo HSI benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nadjustable model compared to existing learning-based compression models. Based\non our results, we establish a guideline for effectively balancing spectral and\nspatial compression across different CRs, taking into account the spatial\nresolution of the HSIs. Our code and pre-trained model weights are publicly\navailable at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/hycass .",

First, the floral source of a honey sample is classified by a\nbotanical origin identification subsystem.

The first step involves\nextracting relevant features from the honey sample using Linear Discriminant\nAnalysis (LDA).

We assess the proposed\nsystem performance on a public honey hyperspectral image dataset. The result\nindicates that the proposed system can detect adulteration in honey with an\noverall cross-validation accuracy of 96.39%, making it an appropriate\nalternative to the current chemical-based detection methods.",

        "summary": "Multimodal planning capabilities refer to the ability to predict, reason, and\ndesign steps for task execution with multimodal context, which is essential for\ncomplex reasoning and decision-making across multiple steps. However, current\nbenchmarks face two key challenges: (1) they cannot directly assess multimodal\nreal-world planning capabilities, and (2) they lack constraints or implicit\nconstraints across modalities. To address these issues, we introduce Multimodal\nPlanning with Complex Constraints (MPCC), the first benchmark to systematically\nevaluate MLLMs' ability to handle multimodal constraints in planning. To\naddress the first challenge, MPCC focuses on three real-world tasks: Flight\nPlanning, Calendar Planning, and Meeting Planning. To solve the second\nchallenge, we introduce complex constraints (e.g. budget, temporal, and\nspatial) in these tasks, with graded difficulty levels (EASY, MEDIUM, HARD) to\nseparate constraint complexity from search space expansion. Experiments on 13\nadvanced MLLMs reveal significant challenges: closed-source models achieve only\n21.3% feasible plans, while open-source models average below 11%. Additionally,\nwe observe that MLLMs are highly sensitive to constraint complexity and that\ntraditional multimodal prompting strategies fail in multi-constraint scenarios.\nOur work formalizes multimodal constraints in planning, provides a rigorous\nevaluation framework, and highlights the need for advancements in\nconstraint-aware reasoning for real-world MLLM applications.",

        "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models like CLIP have become a powerful foundation for\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation due to their strong zero-shot generalization.\nState-of-the-art methods typically leverage CLIP to generate pseudo-labels for\nthe target domain, then fine-tune the model to learn domain-invariant features.\nHowever, these methods attempt to align source and target domains using all\npseudo-labeled data simultaneously. This one-shot alignment struggles with\nnoisy, hard-to-classify samples, leading to error propagation and suboptimal\nfeature learning. The problem is even more amplified in the multi-source\nscenario, where diverse domain gaps and varying noise levels across multiple\nsource domains further destabilize the alignment process. To address this\nissue, in this work, we propose a progressive alignment strategy for adapting\nCLIP to unlabeled downstream task. Our method begins by training the model on a\nhigh-confidence subset of target samples, allowing it to first learn a\nwell-aligned representation from the most reliable data. As training\nprogresses, it gradually incorporates more challenging samples, guiding the\nmodel to refine its understanding without being overwhelmed by initial label\nnoise. This progressive approach effectively mitigates confirmation bias and\npromotes a more robust convergence, allowing for the learning of genuinely\ndomain-invariant features. We name our approach MP^2A and test it on three\npopular UDA benchmarks, namely ImageCLEF, Office-Home, and the most challenging\nDomainNet. Experiments showcase that MP^2A achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance when compared with most recent CLIP-based MS-UDA approaches,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.",

For\ntraffic sign detection, our NanoVerse YOLO model integrates a reparameterizable\nvision-language path aggregation network (RepVL-PAN) and an SPD-Conv module to\nspecifically enhance feature extraction for small, multi-scale targets. For\ntraffic sign classification, we designed a Traffic Sign Recognition Multimodal\nContrastive Learning model (TSR-MCL). By contrasting visual features from a\nVision Transformer with semantic features from a rule-based BERT, TSR-MCL\nlearns robust, frequency-independent representations, effectively mitigating\nclass confusion caused by data imbalance. On the TT100K dataset, our method\nachieves a state-of-the-art 78.4% mAP in the long-tail detection task for\nall-class recognition.

To address this, we propose PriorFusion, a\nunified framework that effectively integrates semantic, geometric, and\ngenerative priors to enhance road element perception. We introduce an\ninstance-aware attention mechanism guided by shape-prior features, then\nconstruct a data-driven shape template space that encodes low-dimensional\nrepresentations of road elements, enabling clustering to generate anchor points\nas reference priors.

        "summary": "Road damage detection is a critical task for ensuring traffic safety and\nmaintaining infrastructure integrity. While deep learning-based detection\nmethods are now widely adopted, they still face two core challenges: first, the\ninadequate multi-scale feature extraction capabilities of existing networks for\ndiverse targets like cracks and potholes, leading to high miss rates for\nsmall-scale damage; and second, the substantial parameter counts and\ncomputational demands of mainstream models, which hinder their deployment for\nefficient, real-time detection in practical applications. To address these\nissues, this paper proposes a high-precision and lightweight model, YOLO - Road\nOrthogonal Compact (YOLO-ROC). We designed a Bidirectional Multi-scale Spatial\nPyramid Pooling Fast (BMS-SPPF) module to enhance multi-scale feature\nextraction and implemented a hierarchical channel compression strategy to\nreduce computational complexity. The BMS-SPPF module leverages a bidirectional\nspatial-channel attention mechanism to improve the detection of small targets.\nConcurrently, the channel compression strategy reduces the parameter count from\n3.01M to 0.89M and GFLOPs from 8.1 to 2.6. Experiments on the\nRDD2022_China_Drone dataset demonstrate that YOLO-ROC achieves a mAP50 of\n67.6%, surpassing the baseline YOLOv8n by 2.11%. Notably, the mAP50 for the\nsmall-target D40 category improved by 16.8%, and the final model size is only\n2.0 MB. Furthermore, the model exhibits excellent generalization performance on\nthe RDD2022_China_Motorbike dataset.",

        "summary": "Fine-grained image classification, the task of distinguishing between\nvisually similar subcategories within a broader category (e.g., bird species,\ncar models, flower types), is a challenging computer vision problem.\nTraditional approaches rely heavily on fixed vocabularies and closed-set\nclassification paradigms, limiting their scalability and adaptability in\nreal-world settings where novel classes frequently emerge. Recent research has\ndemonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for\npredefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in\nharnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily\non the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and\nrefinement. To address these bottlenecks, we propose our training-free method,\nEnriched-FineR (or E-FineR for short), which demonstrates state-of-the-art\nresults in fine-grained visual recognition while also offering greater\ninterpretability, highlighting its strong potential in real-world scenarios and\nnew domains where expert annotations are difficult to obtain. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate the application of our proposed approach to zero-shot and few-shot\nclassification, where it demonstrated performance on par with the existing SOTA\nwhile being training-free and not requiring human interventions. Overall, our\nvocabulary-free framework supports the shift in image classification from rigid\nlabel prediction to flexible, language-driven understanding, enabling scalable\nand generalizable systems for real-world applications.

However, during both training and\ninference, these models rely heavily on dense point sampling along rays from\nmultiple viewpoints, resulting in a surge in floating-point operations and\nseverely limiting their use in resource-constrained scenarios like edge\ncomputing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), which communicate via binary spikes\nover discrete time steps, offer a promising alternative due to their\nenergy-efficient nature. Given the inherent variability in scene scale and\ntexture complexity in neural rendering and the prevailing practice of training\nseparate models per scene, we propose a spike-based NeRF framework with a\ndynamic time step training strategy, termed Pretrain-Adaptive Time-step\nAdjustment (PATA). This approach automatically explores the trade-off between\nrendering quality and time step length during training. Consequently, it\nenables scene-adaptive inference with variable time steps and reduces the\nadditional consumption of computational resources in the inference process.\nAnchoring to the established Instant-NGP architecture, we evaluate our method\nacross diverse datasets. The experimental results show that PATA can preserve\nrendering fidelity while reducing inference time steps by 64\\% and running\npower by 61.55\\%.",

However, overconfidence in deep learning model's predictions\ntranslates to overconfidence in pixel attribution. In this paper, we propose\nthe first approach which incorporates risk estimation into a pixel attribution\nmethod for improved image classification explainability. The proposed method\niteratively applies a classification model with a pixel attribution method to\ncreate a volume of PA maps. This volume is used for the first time, to generate\na pixel-wise distribution of PA values. We introduce a method to generate an\nenhanced PA map by estimating the expectation values of the pixel-wise\ndistributions. In addition, the coefficient of variation (CV) is used to\nestimate pixel-wise risk of this enhanced PA map. Hence, the proposed method\nnot only provides an improved PA map but also produces an estimation of risk on\nthe output PA values. Performance evaluation on probe-based Confocal Laser\nEndomicroscopy (pCLE) data and ImageNet verifies that our improved\nexplainability method outperforms the state-of-the-art.",

Our study introduces a novel\ncategorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of\nrepresentative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from\nmultiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks,\nhighlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven\nby their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.",

        "summary": "This study introduces a novel dataset for segmenting flooded areas in\nsatellite images. After reviewing 77 existing benchmarks utilizing satellite\nimagery, we identified a shortage of suitable datasets for this specific task.\nTo fill this gap, we collected satellite imagery of the 2019 Midwestern USA\nfloods from Planet Explorer by Planet Labs (Image \\c{opyright} 2024 Planet Labs\nPBC). The dataset consists of 10 satellite images per location, each containing\nboth flooded and non-flooded areas. We selected ten locations from each of the\nfive states: Iowa, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, and South Dakota. The dataset\nensures uniform resolution and resizing during data processing. For evaluating\nsemantic segmentation performance, we tested state-of-the-art models in\ncomputer vision and remote sensing on our dataset. Additionally, we conducted\nan ablation study varying window sizes to capture temporal characteristics.\nOverall, the models demonstrated modest results, suggesting a requirement for\nfuture multimodal and temporal learning strategies. The dataset will be\npublicly available on\n<https://github.com/youngsunjang/SDSU_MidWest_Flood_2019>.",

        "summary": "Food crystal agglomeration is a phenomenon occurs during crystallization\nwhich traps water between crystals and affects food product quality. Manual\nannotation of agglomeration in 2D microscopic images is particularly difficult\ndue to the transparency of water bonding and the limited perspective focusing\non a single slide of the imaged sample. To address this challenge, we first\npropose a supervised baseline model to generate segmentation pseudo-labels for\nthe coarsely labeled classification dataset. Next, an instance classification\nmodel that simultaneously performs pixel-wise segmentation is trained. Both\nmodels are used in the inference stage to combine their respective strengths in\nclassification and segmentation. To preserve crystal properties, a post\nprocessing module is designed and included to both steps. Our method improves\ntrue positive agglomeration classification accuracy and size distribution\npredictions compared to other existing methods. Given the variability in\nconfidence levels of manual annotations, our proposed method is evaluated under\ntwo confidence levels and successfully classifies potential agglomerated\ninstances.",

        "summary": "For many real-world applications involving low-power sensor edge devices deep\nneural networks used for image classification might not be suitable. This is\ndue to their typically large model size and require- ment of operations often\nexceeding the capabilities of such resource lim- ited devices. Furthermore,\ncamera sensors usually capture images with a Bayer color filter applied, which\nare subsequently converted to RGB images that are commonly used for neural\nnetwork training. However, on resource-constrained devices, such conversions\ndemands their share of energy and optimally should be skipped if possible. This\nwork ad- dresses the need for hardware-suitable AI targeting sensor edge\ndevices by means of the Video Capsule Endoscopy, an important medical proce-\ndure for the investigation of the small intestine, which is strongly limited by\nits battery lifetime. Accurate organ classification is performed with a final\naccuracy of 93.06% evaluated directly on Bayer images involv- ing a CNN with\nonly 63,000 parameters and time-series analysis in the form of Viterbi\ndecoding. Finally, the process of capturing images with a camera and raw image\nprocessing is demonstrated with a customized PULPissimo System-on-Chip with a\nRISC-V core and an ultra-low power hardware accelerator providing an\nenergy-efficient AI-based image clas- sification approach requiring just 5.31\n{\\mu}J per image. As a result, it is possible to save an average of 89.9% of\nenergy before entering the small intestine compared to classic video capsules.",

        "summary": "Clinical magnetic-resonance (MR) protocols generate many T1 and T2 sequences\nwhose appearance differs more than the acquisition sites that produce them.\nExisting domain-generalization benchmarks focus almost on cross-center shifts\nand overlook this dominant source of variability. Pancreas segmentation remains\na major challenge in abdominal imaging: the gland is small, irregularly,\nsurrounded by organs and fat, and often suffers from low T1 contrast.\nState-of-the-art deep networks that already achieve >90% Dice on the liver or\nkidneys still miss 20-30% of the pancreas. The organ is also systematically\nunder-represented in public cross-domain benchmarks, despite its clinical\nimportance in early cancer detection, surgery, and diabetes research. To close\nthis gap, we present PancreasDG, a large-scale multi-center 3D MRI pancreas\nsegmentation dataset for investigating domain generalization in medical\nimaging. The dataset comprises 563 MRI scans from six institutions, spanning\nboth venous phase and out-of-phase sequences, enabling study of both\ncross-center and cross-sequence variations with pixel-accurate pancreas masks\ncreated by a double-blind, two-pass protocol. Through comprehensive analysis,\nwe reveal three insights: (i) limited sampling introduces significant variance\nthat may be mistaken for distribution shifts, (ii) cross-center performance\ncorrelates with source domain performance for identical sequences, and (iii)\ncross-sequence shifts require specialized solutions. We also propose a\nsemi-supervised approach that leverages anatomical invariances, significantly\noutperforming state-of-the-art domain generalization techniques with 61.63%\nDice score improvements and 87.00% on two test centers for cross-sequence\nsegmentation. PancreasDG sets a new benchmark for domain generalization in\nmedical imaging. Dataset, code, and models will be available at\nhttps://pancreasdg.netlify.app.",
