        "title": "RewardDance: Reward Scaling in Visual Generation",
        "summary": "Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via\nReinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation\nremains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in\nexisting approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input\nmodality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally\nmisaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models\n(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization\nprocess is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the\nreward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes\nthese barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the\nreward score as the model's probability of predicting a \"yes\" token, indicating\nthat the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific\ncriteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM\narchitectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model\nScaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context\nScaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nRewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,\ntext-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the\npersistent challenge of \"reward hacking\": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and\nmaintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance\nto hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly\nrelieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.",

        "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate\ntext-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on\nvisual and textual context. However, these \"judge\" models often suffer from\nbiases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image\ndomains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues\nin unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard\nensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal\nMixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt\nensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to\ndynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each\nsample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and\ngreatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true\nuncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB\noutperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and\ncalibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance\nof multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising\npath forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges\nin data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are\noften required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned\nDiffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample\ntranslation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.\nBy aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB\nseamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a\ntarget-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially\npaired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain\nmapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,\nwhich often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require\nlarge, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and\ndiversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target\ncouplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in\ndepth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend\nLADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation\nmasks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,\nshowcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.\nUltimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world\ndomain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly\nor incomplete.",

        "summary": "Enhancing RAW images captured under low light conditions is a challenging\ntask. Recent deep learning based RAW enhancement methods have shifted from\nusing real paired data to relying on synthetic datasets. These synthetic\ndatasets are typically generated by physically modeling sensor noise, but\nexisting approaches often consider only additive noise, ignore multiplicative\ncomponents, and rely on global calibration that overlooks pixel level\nmanufacturing variations. As a result, such methods struggle to accurately\nreproduce real sensor noise. To address these limitations, this paper derives a\nnoise model from the physical noise generation mechanisms that occur under low\nillumination and proposes a novel composite model that integrates both additive\nand multiplicative noise. To solve the model, we introduce a physics based per\npixel noise simulation and calibration scheme that estimates and synthesizes\nnoise for each individual pixel, thereby overcoming the restrictions of\ntraditional global calibration and capturing spatial noise variations induced\nby microscopic CMOS manufacturing differences. Motivated by the strong\nperformance of rectified flow methods in image generation and processing, we\nfurther combine the physics-based noise synthesis with a rectified flow\ngenerative framework and present PGRF a physics-guided rectified flow framework\nfor low light image enhancement. PGRF leverages the ability of rectified flows\nto model complex data distributions and uses physical guidance to steer the\ngeneration toward the desired clean image. To validate the effectiveness of the\nproposed model, we established the LLID dataset, an indoor low light benchmark\ncaptured with the Sony A7S II camera. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed framework achieves significant improvements in low light RAW image\nenhancement.",

To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified\nself-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation\nthat leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion\nblur and enable intermediate frame prediction.

        "summary": "Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode\nvideo, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.\nImagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing\nmodel is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement\nhas been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video\nSnapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the\noptical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling\nstrategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is\nrandomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated\nthat images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by\nI2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial\nlocation, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then\nbuild a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the\neffectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS\nmeasurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to\nrecover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and\nCCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we\npropose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,\nglobal Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity\nof the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data\nshow that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art\nalgorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its\nhigher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the\napplication perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a\ncomplete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.",

In this work, we present HuMo, a\nunified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first\nchallenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,\nreference images, and audio.

However, no public dataset includes the required triplet\nof prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods\nmust rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a\nsignificant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first\ndataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,\nArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale\nmodifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus\nensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change\ndetection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high\nfidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly\nreduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors.

By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD\nmapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions.

Deep learning multi-task and foundation models\nhave shown strong performance for CXR interpretation but are vulnerable to\nshortcut learning, where models rely on spurious and off-target correlations\nrather than clinically relevant features to make decisions. We introduce\nRoentMod, a counterfactual image editing framework that generates anatomically\nrealistic CXRs with user-specified, synthetic pathology while preserving\nunrelated anatomical features of the original scan. RoentMod combines an\nopen-source medical image generator (RoentGen) with an image-to-image\nmodification model without requiring retraining. In reader studies with\nboard-certified radiologists and radiology residents, RoentMod-produced images\nappeared realistic in 93\\% of cases, correctly incorporated the specified\nfinding in 89-99\\% of cases, and preserved native anatomy comparable to real\nfollow-up CXRs. Using RoentMod, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art multi-task\nand foundation models frequently exploit off-target pathology as shortcuts,\nlimiting their specificity. Incorporating RoentMod-generated counterfactual\nimages during training mitigated this vulnerability, improving model\ndiscrimination across multiple pathologies by 3-19\\% AUC in internal validation\nand by 1-11\\% for 5 out of 6 tested pathologies in external testing. These\nfindings establish RoentMod as a broadly applicable tool for probing and\ncorrecting shortcut learning in medical AI. By enabling controlled\ncounterfactual interventions, RoentMod enhances the robustness and\ninterpretability of CXR interpretation models and provides a generalizable\nstrategy for improving foundation models in medical imaging.",

Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual\nfeatures often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each\nimaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites.

        "summary": "With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging\ndiffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional\ndatasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack\nexposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel\nhigh-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with\nsemantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on\nexisting methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints\ndue to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a\nnovel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV\nbackbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures\nglobal context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision\nstrategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive\nevaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our\napproach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in\nlocalization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its\nsuitability for real-time forensic applications.",

        "summary": "Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level\nprojections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce\nGraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision\nand explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built\nfrom surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with\ngradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and\nbroad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines\nconfidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.\nApplied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,\nconvolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent\nwhile preserving fine-scale glacial features. The resulting bed maps improve\nreliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate\nforecasting and policy.

        "summary": "Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive\nto visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a\nnew task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a\npair of temporally opposite actions, such as \"opening vs. closing a door\",\n\"approaching vs. moving away from something\", \"folding vs. unfolding paper\",\netc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require\nunderstanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial\nposition, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many\nvideo embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which\noffer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a\nself-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of\nfrozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent\nspace with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that\nthis results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the\nproposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and\nCharade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on\nlarge-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification\nperformance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.",

Over\nthe years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they\noften fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This\nreview systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image\nquality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,\ncomputational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection\nmethodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from\ntraditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern\napproaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language\nmodels (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated\nin other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset\ngeneration using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review\nidentifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to\nfully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in\ndynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs\nshows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to\nensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,\nbut their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further\nresearch on optimization techniques.",

The system works end to end\nfrom a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging\n(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after\ncomposites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and\na scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs.

CSSL usually makes use of \\emph{multi-view}\nassumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data\nsamples.

In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun\npointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to\ncases involving \\emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we\npropose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \\emph{mutual\ninformation} to support the \\emph{more than two views} objective and apply it\nto the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed\nmethod helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by\nsegregating between \\emph{intra} and \\emph{inter} discriminatory\ncharacteristics.

We introduce Latent\nDiffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework\ndesigned to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous\napproaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations\nby operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while\nproducing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional\nrefinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE\nacross three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac\nultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action\nrecognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving\nan increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.\nQualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful\nand temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the\ntarget model behavior.

In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)\narchitecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.\nThe method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary\nblock, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the\nrepresentation learning process, enabling better general information\npreservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.\nExperiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate\nthat our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at\nthe same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\\%,\nand enhances SSIM by 1\\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly\n1\\% in parameters.",

        "summary": "Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision\nthat integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.\nExisting methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are\ntypically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to\ncascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a\nnovel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular\n2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D\nsemantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel\nrepresentations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire\npipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously\nnon-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we\npropose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises\nthree components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for\nadaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness\nagainst camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature\npropagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant\nrobustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.",

However, conventional training of early\nexits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full\ndatasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.\nThis mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce\nthe Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training\napproach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.\nEach branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness\nunder selective inference conditions.

However,\nin computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain\nintricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex\nand implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each\nsentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose\nadditional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven\nCross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines\nsimilarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph\ninterpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the\nencoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs.

SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale\npaired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and\nsegmentation tasks across five public datasets.

Recognizing this\nlimitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and\ngeneration framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains\nfatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview\nperspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of\nday, and viewpoints.

Additionally, we propose a\nsnippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training\nto bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features\nlike UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and\ndemonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy\nconsistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy.

Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising\nperformance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,\nexisting methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness\nand noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework\nbased on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.\nTechnically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and\nincrease the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to\nachieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in\neach module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature\nextraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,\na noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex\nnoise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a\nchannel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different\nfeatures across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while\nmaintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the\nISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++.

Specifically, we first construct a\nmulti-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine\nrepresentative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for\nrobust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial\ntransformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field\nmechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale\nspatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates\na lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware\nentropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine\nparameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on\nhigh-confidence unlabeled target samples.

        "title": "Dual-Thresholding Heatmaps to Cluster Proposals for Weakly Supervised Object Detection",
        "summary": "Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention\nin recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art\nmethods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the\nmultiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement\nmodules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key\nlimitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that\neither focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,\nor cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class\ninstances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial\nbackground class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic\ngap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during\noptimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we\nfirst design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which\nutilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo\nGT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between\nadjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic\ndetection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class\nrepresentation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap\nbetween matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss\non ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the\nchallenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and\n55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD\nmethods.

        "summary": "Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape\ncompletion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure\ndiscrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used\nfunctions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on\nnearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,\nleading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse\nregions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index\nselection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance\n(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity\nmore effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical\nuse. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully\ndifferentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn\niterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise\ndistances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum\nassignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic\nruntime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable\noperations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,\nFoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)\nthat generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss\nyields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in\nlow-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without\nadditional hyperparameter search.

Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically\nsignificant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited\naccess to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can\nsupport early detection and timely interventions.\n  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis\ndiagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20\nclasses and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological\nconditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were\nbenchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated\nvia LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a\nweb-based diagnostic tool.\n  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the\nSwin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM\nvisualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,\nincreasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework\nalso demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming\nits ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.\n  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep\nlearning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis\nfrom mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can\nserve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,\nwhere access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection\nand timely intervention.",

To address these issues, we revisit the problem\nfrom the perspective of semantic aggregation.

To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable\nmapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory\nframeworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm\nplantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert\nlabeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset\nprovides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of\nagro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes\noil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was\nensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset\nwas created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it\nsuitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural\nnetworks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY\nlicense, it fills a key gap in training data for remote sensing and aims to\nimprove the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent\nmonitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global\ndeforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.",

        "summary": "Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source\nimage in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods\ntypically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent\nhypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases\n-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong\nzoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source\nlocations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent\nhypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In\nthis paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent\nhypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search\nstrategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating\nthese multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel\ndense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and\npropagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more\nrobust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or\nwhen the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.",

We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module\nthat predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded\ndensity information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.\nExisting density map definitions typically depend on head positions or\nobject-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to\ninclude individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density\ninformation into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to\nimprove detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D\nand 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the\nfirst to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in\ncrowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general\n2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D\nand CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.\nExperiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant\nperformance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most\nstate-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd\ndetector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman\ndataset, demonstrating its generalizability.

In this work, we present a\nnovel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables\nzero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or\npre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path\nplanning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate\ntowards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key\nlimitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory\nusing monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an\nauto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when\nnecessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set\napplicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world\ntests, highlighting its robustness and deployability.

However, CTh forecasting is a\nchallenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral\ncortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific\npredictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian\nBridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional\nconditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at\nthe vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution\nincludes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),\nwhich combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate\ncortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous\napproaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as\ndemonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI\nand OASIS.

        "title": "Sparse BEV Fusion with Self-View Consistency for Multi-View Detection and Tracking",
        "summary": "Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such\nas surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining\nconsistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to\nviewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to\ntracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a\nunified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.\nHowever, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density\ncaused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the\nquality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking\naccuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that\ncombines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it\napplies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during\nprojection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse\nfeatures based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it\nintroduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn\ndiscriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that\nSCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%\non WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline\nmethod TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively\nmitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust\nand accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.",

        "summary": "Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to\nclassify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge\nwith these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring\nthe classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D\napplications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in\nimage-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called\nE3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes\nwithout relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL\ntackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty\nestimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction\nprobabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for\npointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel\ntraining strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic\nspace. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived\nfeatures, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data.

        "summary": "Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral\ninformation and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,\nwhich are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral\ntrackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into\nfalse-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail\nto capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and\ncross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral\nobject tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies\nspectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules\n(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)\nmodule, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral\nfeatures with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within\neach SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial\nand spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.\nBased on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and\nhyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original\nspectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba\nachieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\\% of the\nAUC score and 96.3\\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will\nbe released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.",

        "summary": "Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star\ntracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to\ndetermine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an\nEBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for\ncomparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities\nwhich are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera\nstatic and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we\ncreate a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame\nis that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is\nprocessed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the\nInternational Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation\nof the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared\nacross error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.\nCombined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced\ncomputation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy\nconsumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility\nof event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking.

Recent\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object\nrecognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities\nthat align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,\nit remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social\nnavigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents\nand human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot\nnavigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social\nrobot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to\nmeet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social\nNavigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question\nAnswering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene\nunderstanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB\nprovides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based\nbaselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social\nreasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art\nVLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging\nprobability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler\nrule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in\nsocial scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for\nfurther research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a\nframework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot\nnavigation needs.

For reproducibility, our training configurations and code are\navailable here: https://github.com/UofgCoastline/ICASSP-2026-Robust-Unet.",
