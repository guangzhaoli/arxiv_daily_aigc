        "summary": "We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks:\nimperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a\nmodel. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing,\nwhich can lead to information loss, we propose to \"combat noise with noise\" by\nleveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing\ninformation loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to\nthe input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them\nbefore mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a\nclosed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network\narchitectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for\nspecific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,\narchitecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show\nstate-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,\nestablish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including\nstereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and\npracticality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our\nmethod recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%\non stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of\nadversarial attacks.",

To faithfully simulate play, a model must generate\nnatural content while exploring new scenes and preserve spatial consistency\nwhen revisiting explored areas. Under limited computation budgets, it must\ncompress and exploit historical cues within a finite context window, which\nexposes a trade-off: Temporal-only memory lacks long-term spatial consistency,\nwhereas adding spatial memory strengthens consistency but may degrade new scene\ngeneration quality when the model over-relies on insufficient spatial context.\nWe present Memory Forcing, a learning framework that pairs training protocols\nwith a geometry-indexed spatial memory. Hybrid Training exposes distinct\ngameplay regimes, guiding the model to rely on temporal memory during\nexploration and incorporate spatial memory for revisits. Chained Forward\nTraining extends autoregressive training with model rollouts, where chained\npredictions create larger pose variations and encourage reliance on spatial\nmemory for maintaining consistency.

However, existing methods often struggle to\nmodel such complex and dynamic interactions. While recent studies show that\nmasks can serve as effective control signals and enhance generation quality,\nobtaining dense and precise mask annotations remains a major challenge for\nreal-world use. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Mask2IV, a novel\nframework specifically designed for interaction-centric video generation. It\nadopts a decoupled two-stage pipeline that first predicts plausible motion\ntrajectories for both actor and object, then generates a video conditioned on\nthese trajectories. This design eliminates the need for dense mask inputs from\nusers while preserving the flexibility to manipulate the interaction process.\nFurthermore, Mask2IV supports versatile and intuitive control, allowing users\nto specify the target object of interaction and guide the motion trajectory\nthrough action descriptions or spatial position cues. To support systematic\ntraining and evaluation, we curate two benchmarks covering diverse action and\nobject categories across both human-object interaction and robotic manipulation\nscenarios.

To address these\nchallenges, we first propose the Hierarchical Visual-Grounded Captioning (HVGC)\nframework that generates pairs of disentangled captions, a video caption, and\nan audio caption, eliminating interference at the conditioning stage. Based on\nHVGC, we further introduce BridgeDiT, a novel dual-tower diffusion transformer,\nwhich employs a Dual CrossAttention (DCA) mechanism that acts as a robust\n``bridge\" to enable a symmetric, bidirectional exchange of information,\nachieving both semantic and temporal synchronization. Extensive experiments on\nthree benchmark datasets, supported by human evaluations, demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art results on most metrics.

        "summary": "Reference-driven image completion, which restores missing regions in a target\nview using additional images, is particularly challenging when the target view\ndiffers significantly from the references. Existing generative methods rely\nsolely on diffusion priors and, without geometric cues such as camera pose or\ndepth, often produce misaligned or implausible content. We propose GeoComplete,\na novel framework that incorporates explicit 3D structural guidance to enforce\ngeometric consistency in the completed regions, setting it apart from prior\nimage-only approaches. GeoComplete introduces two key ideas: conditioning the\ndiffusion process on projected point clouds to infuse geometric information,\nand applying target-aware masking to guide the model toward relevant reference\ncues. The framework features a dual-branch diffusion architecture. One branch\nsynthesizes the missing regions from the masked target, while the other\nextracts geometric features from the projected point cloud. Joint\nself-attention across branches ensures coherent and accurate completion. To\naddress regions visible in references but absent in the target, we project the\ntarget view into each reference to detect occluded areas, which are then masked\nduring training. This target-aware masking directs the model to focus on useful\ncues, enhancing performance in difficult scenarios. By integrating a\ngeometry-aware dual-branch diffusion architecture with a target-aware masking\nstrategy, GeoComplete offers a unified and robust solution for\ngeometry-conditioned image completion. Experiments show that GeoComplete\nachieves a 17.1 PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods, significantly\nboosting geometric accuracy while maintaining high visual quality.",

A common strategy consists\nin retraining the generative model on its own synthetic data in order to\nmitigate forgetting. Yet, such an approach faces two major limitations: (i) the\ncontinually increasing training time eventually becomes intractable, and (ii)\nreliance on synthetic data inevitably leads to long-term performance\ndegradation, since synthetic samples lack the richness of real training data.\nIn this paper, we attenuate these issues by designing a novel and more\nexpressive conditioning mechanism for generative models based on low rank\nadaptation (LoRA), that exclusively employs rank 1 matrices, whose\nreparametrized matrix rank is functionally increased using carefully selected\nfunctions -- and dubbed functional LoRA: FunLoRA.

Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection\nmethods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their\nnarrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an\nintegrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield,\nthe novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing\nimage forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document\nmanipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively\nintegrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent\nintelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection\nmodels, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a\nunified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments\nshow that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing\nunified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior\npracticality, adaptiveness, and scalability.",

How can we ensure fusion quality control to prevent degradation from\nnoisy information? How can we maintain modality identity consistency in\nmulti-output generation? Driven by these clinical necessities, and drawing\ninspiration from SAM2's sequential frame paradigm and clinicians' progressive\nworkflow of incrementally adding and selectively integrating multi-modal\ninformation, we treat multi-modal medical data as sequential frames with\nquality-driven selection mechanisms. Our key idea is to \"learn\" adaptive\nweights for each modality-task pair and \"memorize\" beneficial fusion patterns\nthrough progressive enhancement. To achieve this, we design three collaborative\nmodules: PreWeightNet for global contribution assessment, ThresholdNet for\nadaptive filtering, and EffiWeightNet for effective weight computation.\nMeanwhile, to maintain modality identity consistency, we propose the Causal\nModality Identity Module (CMIM) that establishes causal constraints between\ngenerated images and target modality descriptions using vision-language\nmodeling.

        "summary": "Understanding long-form videos remains a significant challenge for\nvision--language models (VLMs) due to their extensive temporal length and high\ninformation density. Most current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely\non uniform sampling, which often overlooks critical moments, leading to\nincorrect responses to queries. In parallel, many keyframe selection approaches\nimpose rigid temporal spacing: once a frame is chosen, an exclusion window\nsuppresses adjacent timestamps to reduce redundancy. While effective at\nlimiting overlap, this strategy frequently misses short, fine-grained cues near\nimportant events. Other methods instead emphasize visual diversity but neglect\nquery relevance. We propose AdaRD-Key, a training-free keyframe sampling module\nfor query-driven long-form video understanding. AdaRD-Key maximizes a unified\nRelevance--Diversity Max-Volume (RD-MV) objective, combining a\nquery-conditioned relevance score with a log-determinant diversity component to\nyield informative yet non-redundant frames. To handle broad queries with weak\nalignment to the video, AdaRD-Key employs a lightweight relevance-aware gating\nmechanism; when the relevance distribution indicates weak alignment, the method\nseamlessly shifts into a diversity-only mode, enhancing coverage without\nadditional supervision. Our pipeline is training-free, computationally\nefficient (running in real time on a single GPU), and compatible with existing\nVLMs in a plug-and-play manner.

        "summary": "This paper presents a novel and efficient image enhancement method based on\npigment representation. Unlike conventional methods where the color\ntransformation is restricted to pre-defined color spaces like RGB, our method\ndynamically adapts to input content by transforming RGB colors into a\nhigh-dimensional feature space referred to as \\textit{pigments}. The proposed\npigment representation offers adaptability and expressiveness, achieving\nsuperior image enhancement performance. The proposed method involves\ntransforming input RGB colors into high-dimensional pigments, which are then\nreprojected individually and blended to refine and aggregate the information of\nthe colors in pigment spaces. Those pigments are then transformed back into RGB\ncolors to generate an enhanced output image. The transformation and\nreprojection parameters are derived from the visual encoder which adaptively\nestimates such parameters based on the content in the input image. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed\nmethod over state-of-the-art methods in image enhancement tasks, including\nimage retouching and tone mapping, while maintaining relatively low\ncomputational complexity and small model size.",

        "summary": "Reconstructing physically plausible human motion from monocular videos\nremains a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods\nprimarily focus on kinematics-based pose estimation, often leading to\nunrealistic results due to the lack of physical constraints. To address such\nartifacts, prior methods have typically relied on physics-based post-processing\nfollowing the initial kinematics-based motion estimation. However, this\ntwo-stage design introduces error accumulation, ultimately limiting the overall\nreconstruction quality. In this paper, we present PhysHMR, a unified framework\nthat directly learns a visual-to-action policy for humanoid control in a\nphysics-based simulator, enabling motion reconstruction that is both physically\ngrounded and visually aligned with the input video. A key component of our\napproach is the pixel-as-ray strategy, which lifts 2D keypoints into 3D spatial\nrays and transforms them into global space. These rays are incorporated as\npolicy inputs, providing robust global pose guidance without depending on noisy\n3D root predictions. This soft global grounding, combined with local visual\nfeatures from a pretrained encoder, allows the policy to reason over both\ndetailed pose and global positioning. To overcome the sample inefficiency of\nreinforcement learning, we further introduce a distillation scheme that\ntransfers motion knowledge from a mocap-trained expert to the\nvision-conditioned policy, which is then refined using physically motivated\nreinforcement learning rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhysHMR\nproduces high-fidelity, physically plausible motion across diverse scenarios,\noutperforming prior approaches in both visual accuracy and physical realism.",

        "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in\nrapid and high-fidelity personalization, even when provided with only a few\nuser images. However, the effectiveness of personalization techniques has lead\nto concerns regarding data privacy, intellectual property protection, and\nunauthorized usage. To mitigate such unauthorized usage and model replication,\nthe idea of generating ``unlearnable'' training samples utilizing image\npoisoning techniques has emerged. Existing methods for this have limited\nimperceptibility as they operate in the pixel space which results in images\nwith noise and artifacts. In this work, we propose a novel model-based\nperturbation strategy that operates within the latent space of diffusion\nmodels. Our method alternates between denoising and inversion while modifying\nthe starting point of the denoising trajectory: of diffusion models. This\ntrajectory-shifted sampling ensures that the perturbed images maintain high\nvisual fidelity to the original inputs while being resistant to inversion and\npersonalization by downstream generative models. This approach integrates\nunlearnability into the framework of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), enabling a\npractical and imperceptible defense against unauthorized model adaptation. We\nvalidate our approach on four benchmark datasets to demonstrate robustness\nagainst state-of-the-art inversion attacks. Results demonstrate that our method\nachieves significant improvements in imperceptibility ($\\sim 8 \\% -10\\%$ on\nperceptual metrics including PSNR, SSIM, and FID) and robustness ( $\\sim 10\\%$\non average across five adversarial settings), highlighting its effectiveness in\nsafeguarding sensitive data.",

        "summary": "3D editing - the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D\nasset - has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital\nentertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging\ndue to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and\nfine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to\ngeometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are\nerror-prone and impractical. To address these challenges, we advance both the\ndata and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce 3DEditVerse, the largest\npaired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training\npairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of\npose-driven geometric edits and foundation model-guided appearance edits,\n3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic\nalignment. On the model side, we propose 3DEditFormer, a\n3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D\ngeneration with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer\ndisentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and\nconsistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks.

However, they still struggle to effectively\nunderstand and follow long and detailed prompts, displaying inconsistent\ngeneration. To address this challenge, we introduce LPG-Bench, a comprehensive\nbenchmark for evaluating long-prompt-based text-to-image generation. LPG-Bench\nfeatures 200 meticulously crafted prompts with an average length of over 250\nwords, approaching the input capacity of several leading commercial models.\nUsing these prompts, we generate 2,600 images from 13 state-of-the-art models\nand further perform comprehensive human-ranked annotations. Based on LPG-Bench,\nwe observe that state-of-the-art T2I alignment evaluation metrics exhibit poor\nconsistency with human preferences on long-prompt-based image generation. To\naddress the gap, we introduce a novel zero-shot metric based on\ntext-to-image-to-text consistency, termed TIT, for evaluating\nlong-prompt-generated images. The core concept of TIT is to quantify T2I\nalignment by directly comparing the consistency between the raw prompt and the\nLMM-produced description on the generated image, which includes an efficient\nscore-based instantiation TIT-Score and a large-language-model (LLM) based\ninstantiation TIT-Score-LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nframework achieves superior alignment with human judgment compared to\nCLIP-score, LMM-score, etc., with TIT-Score-LLM attaining a 7.31% absolute\nimprovement in pairwise accuracy over the strongest baseline.

        "summary": "Despite their powerful capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nsuffer from considerable computational overhead due to their reliance on\nmassive visual tokens. Recent studies have explored token pruning to alleviate\nthis problem, which typically uses text-vision cross-attention or\n[\\texttt{CLS}] attention to assess and discard redundant visual tokens. In this\nwork, we identify a critical limitation of such attention-first pruning\napproaches, i.e., they tend to preserve semantically similar tokens, resulting\nin pronounced performance drops under high pruning ratios. To this end, we\npropose {HoloV}, a simple yet effective, plug-and-play visual token pruning\nframework for efficient inference. Distinct from previous attention-first\nschemes, HoloV rethinks token retention from a holistic perspective. By\nadaptively distributing the pruning budget across different spatial crops,\nHoloV ensures that the retained tokens capture the global visual context rather\nthan isolated salient features. This strategy minimizes representational\ncollapse and maintains task-relevant information even under aggressive pruning.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our HoloV achieves superior performance\nacross various tasks, MLLM architectures, and pruning ratios compared to SOTA\nmethods. For instance, LLaVA1.5 equipped with HoloV preserves 95.8\\% of the\noriginal performance after pruning 88.9\\% of visual tokens, achieving superior\nefficiency-accuracy trade-offs.",

To caption an image, they proceed by textually decoding a\ntext-aligned image feature, but they limit their scope to global\nrepresentations and whole-image captions. We present \\frameworkName{}, a\nunified framework for zero-shot captioning that shifts from an image-centric to\na patch-centric paradigm, enabling the captioning of arbitrary regions without\nthe need of region-level supervision. Instead of relying on global image\nrepresentations, we treat individual patches as atomic captioning units and\naggregate them to describe arbitrary regions, from single patches to\nnon-contiguous areas and entire images. We analyze the key ingredients that\nenable current latent captioners to work in our novel proposed framework.\nExperiments demonstrate that backbones producing meaningful, dense visual\nfeatures, such as DINO, are key to achieving state-of-the-art performance in\nmultiple region-based captioning tasks.

This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble\nlearning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade\nand freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A\nnovel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,\nwith egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert\nassessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and\nHaugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply\nmachine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only\nexternal, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding\nlabeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from\nexternal egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and\nweight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature\nextraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,\nDenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,\nSMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning\nalgorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the\nbest-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only\nand tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble\napproach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in\nfreshness prediction.

        "summary": "What does it mean for a machine to recognize beauty? While beauty remains a\nculturally and experientially compelling but philosophically elusive concept,\ndeep learning systems increasingly appear capable of modeling aesthetic\njudgment. In this paper, we explore the capacity of neural networks to\nrepresent beauty despite the immense formal diversity of objects for which the\nterm applies. By drawing on recent work on cross-model representational\nconvergence, we show how aesthetic content produces more similar and aligned\nrepresentations between models which have been trained on distinct data and\nmodalities - while unaesthetic images do not produce more aligned\nrepresentations. This finding implies that the formal structure of beautiful\nimages has a realist basis - rather than only as a reflection of socially\nconstructed values. Furthermore, we propose that these realist representations\nexist because of a joint grounding of aesthetic form in physical and cultural\nsubstance. We argue that human perceptual and creative acts play a central role\nin shaping these the latent spaces of deep learning systems, but that a realist\nbasis for aesthetics shows that machines are not mere creative parrots but can\nproduce novel creative insights from the unique vantage point of scale. Our\nfindings suggest that human-machine co-creation is not merely possible, but\nfoundational - with beauty serving as a teleological attractor in both cultural\nproduction and machine perception.",

While their\ncapabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those\nproblems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for\nthe phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual\nand text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue,\nsuch as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive\ndecoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and\nattention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this\nwork, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach\nutilizes the \"image heads\" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive\nsamples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and\nQwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The\nresults demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of\nhallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding\nresources could be found at: https://github.com/Deng-Jingyuan/MaskCD .",

        "summary": "Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed\nmedical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and\ndisjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to\nrepresentation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing\nfeatures from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target\nthe representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,\ndetector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we\ndefine modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging\nmodality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate\nthe modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context\nAttention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to\npropagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style\narchitectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into\nobject queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that\naligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific\ncontrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and\nQueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer\neffectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained\naltogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal\noverhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward\nrobust multimodality medical object detection.

        "summary": "Age Related Macular Degeneration(AMD) has been one of the most leading causes\nof permanent vision impairment in ophthalmology. Though treatments, such as\nanti VEGF drugs or photodynamic therapies, were developed to slow down the\ndegenerative process of AMD, there is still no specific cure to reverse vision\nloss caused by AMD. Thus, for AMD, detecting existence of risk factors of AMD\nor AMD itself within the patient retina in early stages is a crucial task to\nreduce the possibility of vision impairment. Apart from traditional approaches,\ndeep learning based methods, especially attention mechanism based CNNs and\nGradCAM based XAI analysis on OCT scans, exhibited successful performance in\ndistinguishing AMD retina from normal retinas, making it possible to use AI\ndriven models to aid medical diagnosis and analysis by ophthalmologists\nregarding AMD. However, though having significant success, previous works\nmostly focused on prediction performance itself, not pathologies or underlying\ncausal mechanisms of AMD, which can prohibit intervention analysis on specific\nfactors or even lead to less reliable decisions. Thus, this paper introduces a\nnovel causal AMD analysis model: GCVAMD, which incorporates a modified\nCausalVAE approach that can extract latent causal factors from only raw OCT\nimages. By considering causality in AMD detection, GCVAMD enables causal\ninference such as treatment simulation or intervention analysis regarding major\nrisk factors: drusen and neovascularization, while returning informative latent\ncausal features that can enhance downstream tasks. Results show that through\nGCVAMD, drusen status and neovascularization status can be identified with AMD\ncausal mechanisms in GCVAMD latent spaces, which can in turn be used for\nvarious tasks from AMD detection(classification) to intervention analysis.",

        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP and Grounding DINO have achieved\nremarkable success in object recognition and detection. However, their\nperformance often degrades under real-world distribution shifts. Test-time\nadaptation (TTA) aims to mitigate this issue by adapting models during\ninference. Existing methods either rely on computationally expensive\nbackpropagation, which hinders real-time deployment, or focus solely on\nlikelihood adaptation, which overlooks the critical role of the prior. Our\nprior work, Bayesian Class Adaptation (BCA), addressed these shortcomings for\nobject recognition by introducing a training-free framework that incorporates\nadaptive priors. Building upon this foundation, we now present Bayesian Class\nAdaptation plus (BCA+), a unified, training-free framework for TTA for both\nobject recognition and detection. BCA+ introduces a dynamic cache that\nadaptively stores and updates class embeddings, spatial scales (for detection),\nand, crucially, adaptive class priors derived from historical predictions. We\nformulate adaptation as a Bayesian inference problem, where final predictions\nare generated by fusing the initial VLM output with a cache-based prediction.\nThis cache-based prediction combines a dynamically updated likelihood\n(measuring feature and scale similarity) and a prior (reflecting the evolving\nclass distribution). This dual-adaptation mechanism, coupled with\nuncertainty-guided fusion, enables BCA+ to correct both the model's semantic\nunderstanding and its contextual confidence. As a training-free method\nrequiring no backpropagation, BCA+ is highly efficient. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that BCA+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on both recognition\nand detection benchmarks.",

        "summary": "Traditional denoising methods for noise removal have largely relied on\nhandcrafted priors, often perform well in controlled environments but struggle\nto address the complexity and variability of real noise. In contrast, deep\nlearning-based approaches have gained prominence for learning noise\ncharacteristics from large datasets, but these methods frequently require\nextensive labeled data and may not generalize effectively across diverse noise\ntypes and imaging conditions. In this paper, we present an innovative method,\ntermed as Net2Net, that combines the strengths of untrained and pre-trained\nnetworks to tackle the challenges of real-world noise removal. The innovation\nof Net2Net lies in its combination of unsupervised DIP and supervised\npre-trained model DRUNet by regularization by denoising (RED). The untrained\nnetwork adapts to the unique noise characteristics of each input image without\nrequiring labeled data, while the pre-trained network leverages learned\nrepresentations from large-scale datasets to deliver robust denoising\nperformance. This hybrid framework enhances generalization across varying noise\npatterns and improves performance, particularly in scenarios with limited\ntraining data. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our method for real-world noise removal.",

        "summary": "Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for\noptimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically\ninspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE\ngoverning geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the\ncorresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which\nsurprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential\ngradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for\nimage data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample\ngeneration starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,\nFashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the\nnew scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a\nbiologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates,\nfounded on geometric Brownian motion.",

To address these\nissues, our new video distillation method leverages input human pose\nconditioning for both attention and loss functions.

The benefits of\ncollaboration increased as the difference in baseline accuracy between\ncollaborators decreased-following the Proximal Accuracy Rule (PAR). This rule\npredicted collaborative (fusion) benefit across a wide range of baseline\nabilities, from people with no training to those with extensive training. Using\nthe PAR, we established a critical fusion zone, where humans are less accurate\nthan the machine, but fusing the two improves system accuracy. This zone was\nsurprisingly large. We implemented \"intelligent human-machine fusion\" by\nselecting people with the potential to increase the accuracy of a\nhigh-performing machine. Intelligent fusion was more accurate than the machine\noperating alone and more accurate than combining all human and machine\njudgments. The highest system-wide accuracy achievable with human-only\npartnerships was found by graph theory.

Current RLAIF frameworks\nrely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create\ncalibrated scalar rewards-- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose\nOracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a\nmore general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate\nmodel responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce\n$GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware\nadvantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently\noutperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated\nacross various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to\ncreating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal\nvideo models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.",

        "summary": "We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of\ndistance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density\nover a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship\nbetween information theory and estimation theory, which links the\nlog-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to\nnoisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of\nsignals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of\nnoise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector\nfields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels.\nWe prove that the IEM is a valid global metric and derive a closed-form\nexpression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian\nmetric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the\nMahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both\nlocally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM\ncan be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion\nmodels) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our\nframework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this\nIEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image\nquality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.",

We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER\ntokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference\npositions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate\ncoordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial\nencoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally,\naddressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on\nScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in\ngrounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution\ninterfaces.

        "summary": "Semantic distillation in radiance fields has spurred significant advances in\nopen-vocabulary robot policies, e.g., in manipulation and navigation, founded\non pretrained semantics from large vision models. While prior work has\ndemonstrated the effectiveness of visual-only semantic features (e.g., DINO and\nCLIP) in Gaussian Splatting and neural radiance fields, the potential benefit\nof geometry-grounding in distilled fields remains an open question. In\nprinciple, visual-geometry features seem very promising for spatial tasks such\nas pose estimation, prompting the question: Do geometry-grounded semantic\nfeatures offer an edge in distilled fields? Specifically, we ask three critical\nquestions: First, does spatial-grounding produce higher-fidelity geometry-aware\nsemantic features? We find that image features from geometry-grounded backbones\ncontain finer structural details compared to their counterparts. Secondly, does\ngeometry-grounding improve semantic object localization? We observe no\nsignificant difference in this task. Thirdly, does geometry-grounding enable\nhigher-accuracy radiance field inversion? Given the limitations of prior work\nand their lack of semantics integration, we propose a novel framework SPINE for\ninverting radiance fields without an initial guess, consisting of two core\ncomponents: coarse inversion using distilled semantics, and fine inversion\nusing photometric-based optimization. Surprisingly, we find that the pose\nestimation accuracy decreases with geometry-grounded features. Our results\nsuggest that visual-only features offer greater versatility for a broader range\nof downstream tasks, although geometry-grounded features contain more geometric\ndetail. Notably, our findings underscore the necessity of future research on\neffective strategies for geometry-grounding that augment the versatility and\nperformance of pretrained semantic features.",

        "summary": "The success of DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates the immense potential of using\nreinforcement learning (RL) to enhance LLMs' reasoning capabilities. This paper\nintroduces Retrv-R1, the first R1-style MLLM specifically designed for\nmultimodal universal retrieval, achieving higher performance by employing\nstep-by-step reasoning to produce more accurate retrieval results. We find that\ndirectly applying the methods of DeepSeek-R1 to retrieval tasks is not\nfeasible, mainly due to (1) the high computational cost caused by the large\ntoken consumption required for multiple candidates with reasoning processes,\nand (2) the instability and suboptimal results when directly applying RL to\ntrain for retrieval tasks. To address these issues, Retrv-R1 introduces an\ninformation compression module with a details inspection mechanism, which\nenhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens while\nensuring that critical information for challenging candidates is preserved.\nFurthermore, a new training paradigm is proposed, including an activation stage\nusing a retrieval-tailored synthetic CoT dataset for more effective\noptimization, followed by RL with a novel curriculum reward to improve both\nperformance and efficiency. Incorporating these novel designs, Retrv-R1\nachieves SOTA performance, high efficiency, and strong generalization ability,\nas demonstrated by experiments across multiple benchmarks and tasks.",

We propose a\nmotion-adaptive framework that aligns control density with motion complexity.\nLeveraging semantic and motion priors from vision foundation models, we\nestablish patch-token-node correspondences and apply motion-adaptive\ncompression to concentrate control points in dynamic regions while suppressing\nredundancy in static backgrounds. Our approach achieves flexible\nrepresentational density adaptation through iterative voxelization and motion\ntendency scoring, directly addressing the fundamental mismatch between control\npoint allocation and motion complexity.

        "summary": "Reliable risk assessment for carotid atheromatous disease remains a major\nclinical challenge, as it requires integrating diverse clinical and imaging\ninformation in a manner that is transparent and interpretable to clinicians.\nThis study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large\nvision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by\nintegrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic,\nlaboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic\ndiagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed,\ncomparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and\nmedically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very\npowerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy,\nwhile all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address\nthis limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using\nlow-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke\nrisk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of\ntext further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive\nperformance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines\ntrained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and\nlimitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction,\nunderscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and\ndomain adaptation for clinical translation.",

        "summary": "Visual Language Models (VLMs), with powerful multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities, are gradually integrated into autonomous driving by several\nautomobile manufacturers to enhance planning capability in challenging\nenvironments. However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work\nzones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and\ndynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this\ngap, we conduct the \\textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone\ntrajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct\ntrajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first\nidentify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and\nthen confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human\nverification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory\nplanning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases\ninto constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG\nretrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation.\nExperimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a\nreduction of around $3\\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM\nbaselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the\nlowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning\n($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone\nscenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of\nREACT-Drive.",

In\naddition to digital adversarial attacks, models are vulnerable to existing\nperturbations (glare, rain, dirt, or graffiti), which could lead to dangerous\nmisclassifications. The current work lacks consideration of temporal\ncontinuity, multistatic field-of-view (FoV) sensing, and robustness to both\ndigital and natural degradation. This study proposes a dual FoV,\nsequence-preserving robustness framework for traffic lights and signs in the\nUSA based on a multi-source dataset built on aiMotive, Udacity, Waymo, and\nself-recorded videos from the region of Texas. Mid and long-term sequences of\nRGB images are temporally aligned for four operational design domains (ODDs):\nhighway, night, rainy, and urban. Over a series of experiments on a real-life\napplication of anomaly detection, this study outlines a unified three-layer\ndefense stack framework that incorporates feature squeezing, defensive\ndistillation, and entropy-based anomaly detection, as well as sequence-wise\ntemporal voting for further enhancement. The evaluation measures included\naccuracy, attack success rate (ASR), risk-weighted misclassification severity,\nand confidence stability. Physical transferability was confirmed using probes\nfor recapture. The results showed that the Unified Defense Stack achieved\n79.8mAP and reduced the ASR to 18.2%, which is superior to YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and\nBEVFormer, while reducing the high-risk misclassification to 32%.",

        "summary": "Randomized neural networks for representation learning have consistently\nachieved prominent results in texture recognition tasks, effectively combining\nthe advantages of both traditional techniques and learning-based approaches.\nHowever, existing approaches have so far focused mainly on improving\ncross-information prediction, without introducing significant advancements to\nthe overall randomized network architecture. In this paper, we propose Mixer, a\nnovel randomized neural network for texture representation learning. At its\ncore, the method leverages hyperspherical random embeddings coupled with a\ndual-branch learning module to capture both intra- and inter-channel\nrelationships, further enhanced by a newly formulated optimization problem for\nbuilding rich texture representations. Experimental results have shown the\ninteresting results of the proposed approach across several pure texture\nbenchmarks, each with distinct characteristics and challenges.

        "summary": "Visual navigation policy is widely regarded as a promising direction, as it\nmimics humans by using egocentric visual observations for navigation. However,\noptical information of visual observations is difficult to be explicitly\nmodeled like LiDAR point clouds or depth maps, which subsequently requires\nintelligent models and large-scale data. To this end, we propose to leverage\nthe intelligence of the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model to learn diverse\nnavigation capabilities from synthetic expert data in a teacher-student manner.\nSpecifically, we implement the VLA model, MM-Nav, as a multi-view VLA (with 360\nobservations) based on pretrained large language models and visual foundation\nmodels. For large-scale navigation data, we collect expert data from three\nreinforcement learning (RL) experts trained with privileged depth information\nin three challenging tailor-made environments for different navigation\ncapabilities: reaching, squeezing, and avoiding. We iteratively train our VLA\nmodel using data collected online from RL experts, where the training ratio is\ndynamically balanced based on performance on individual capabilities. Through\nextensive experiments in synthetic environments, we demonstrate that our model\nachieves strong generalization capability. Moreover, we find that our student\nVLA model outperforms the RL teachers, demonstrating the synergistic effect of\nintegrating multiple capabilities. Extensive real-world experiments further\nconfirm the effectiveness of our method.",

        "summary": "Supervised deep learning for land cover semantic segmentation (LCS) relies on\nlabeled satellite data. However, most existing Sentinel-2 datasets are\ncloud-free, which limits their usefulness in tropical regions where clouds are\ncommon. To properly evaluate the extent of this problem, we developed a cloud\ninjection algorithm that simulates realistic cloud cover, allowing us to test\nhow Sentinel-1 radar data can fill in the gaps caused by cloud-obstructed\noptical imagery. We also tackle the issue of losing spatial and/or spectral\ndetails during encoder downsampling in deep networks. To mitigate this loss, we\npropose a lightweight method that injects Normalized Difference Indices (NDIs)\ninto the final decoding layers, enabling the model to retain key spatial\nfeatures with minimal additional computation. Injecting NDIs enhanced land\ncover segmentation performance on the DFC2020 dataset, yielding improvements of\n1.99% for U-Net and 2.78% for DeepLabV3 on cloud-free imagery. Under\ncloud-covered conditions, incorporating Sentinel-1 data led to significant\nperformance gains across all models compared to using optical data alone,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of radar-optical fusion in challenging\natmospheric scenarios.",

Large vision\nfoundation models, includ- ing DINOv2, InternImage, and CLIP, have advanced\nvisual representation learn- ing by providing rich features that generalize\nwell across diverse tasks. While their strength in closed-set semantic tasks is\nestablished, their capability to detect out- of-distribution (OoD) regions in\nsemantic segmentation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate\nwhether foundation models fine-tuned on segmen- tation datasets can inherently\ndistinguish in-distribution (ID) from OoD regions without any outlier\nsupervision. We propose a simple, training-free approach that utilizes features\nfrom the InternImage backbone and applies K-Means clustering alongside\nconfidence thresholding on raw decoder logits to identify OoD clusters. Our\nmethod achieves 50.02 Average Precision on the RoadAnomaly benchmark and 48.77\non the benchmark of ADE-OoD with InternImage-L, surpassing several supervised\nand unsupervised baselines.

Few solutions exist\nto capture the 6 degrees of freedom of an object with nanometric and\nmicroradians resolutions over relatively large ranges. Over the years, we have\nproposed several fiducial marker and pattern designs to achieve reliable\nperformance for various microscopy applications. Centimeter ranges are possible\nusing pattern encoding methods, while nanometer resolutions can be achieved\nusing phase processing of the periodic frames. This paper presents VERNIER, an\nopen source phase processing software designed to provide fast and reliable\npose measurement based on pseudo-periodic patterns. Thanks to a phase-based\nlocal thresholding algorithm, the software has proven to be particularly robust\nto noise, defocus and occlusion. The successive steps of the phase processing\nare presented, as well as the different types of patterns that address\ndifferent application needs. The implementation procedure is illustrated with\nsynthetic and experimental images.

The\ndataset was collected over a controlled test field seeded with 143 realistic\nsurrogate landmine and UXO targets, including surface, partially buried, and\nfully buried configurations. Data acquisition was performed using a Headwall\nNano-Hyperspec sensor mounted on a multi-sensor drone platform, flown at an\naltitude of approximately 20.6 m, capturing 270 contiguous spectral bands\nspanning 398-1002 nm. Radiometric calibration, orthorectification, and\nmosaicking were performed followed by reflectance retrieval using a two-point\nEmpirical Line Method (ELM), with reference spectra acquired using an SVC\nspectroradiometer. Cross-validation against six reference objects yielded RMSE\nvalues below 1.0 and SAM values between 1 and 6 degrees in the 400-900 nm\nrange, demonstrating high spectral fidelity. The dataset is released alongside\nraw radiance cubes, GCP/AeroPoint data, and reference spectra to support\nreproducible research. This contribution fills a critical gap in open-access\nUAV-based hyperspectral data for landmine detection and offers a multi-sensor\nbenchmark when combined with previously published drone-based electromagnetic\ninduction (EMI) data from the same test field.",
