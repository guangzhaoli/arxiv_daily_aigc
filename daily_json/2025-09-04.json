        "summary": "We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates\nunderstanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only\ntransformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for\nexternal components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer\nduring inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for\nhigh-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)\nobjective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we\npioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language\nModel (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based\nmethods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings\ndemonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a\nsufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a\nresult, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing\nopen-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal\ngeneration, editing, and understanding.",

        "summary": "Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle\ndamage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the\ndefect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and\ncomputational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without\nusing ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we\npropose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect\ndetection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the\ngenerative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall\nimages to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our\nproposed CLIP-based Fr\\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in\nJTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to\nsynthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of\nbetter quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data\naugmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road\ndefect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no\nensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters\ncompared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for\ndeployment on edge devices in practice.",

Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases\nwithout understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first\npropose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and\nprevious outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method.

        "summary": "Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual\nprompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be\ninferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and\nreasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning\nbeyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing\ncomprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,\nthese advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas\ncurrent benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified\none-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a\ncomprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and\nreasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure\ncomposition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and\nreasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,\ninductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To\nincrease complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world\nscenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for\ncomposition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt\nwith a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each\nintended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable\nevaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts\nand around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models\nreveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex\nhigh-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind\nas a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements\nfrom prompts.

        "summary": "Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to\nresolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.\nExisting Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of\ncoarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal\nreasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for\ntemporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object\nreferences and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a\nsynthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs\nwith spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces\ndiverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates\ntemporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and\ntemporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their\nlocations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our\napproach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal\nreferences, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for\nreal-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human\nannotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental\nevaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform\nbaselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,\nthese models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new\nfoundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.",

We address these challenges by time-scaling\nState-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before.

We assessed performance on ocular disease detection and\nsystemic disease prediction using two adaptation strategies: fine-tuning and\nlinear probing.

Our results show that although scaling generalist models yields strong\nadaptability across diverse tasks, RETFound-DINOv2 consistently outperforms\nthese generalist foundation models in ocular-disease detection and oculomics\ntasks, demonstrating stronger generalisability and data efficiency. These\nfindings suggest that specialist retinal foundation models remain the most\neffective choice for clinical applications, while the narrowing gap with\ngeneralist foundation models suggests that continued data and model scaling can\ndeliver domain-relevant gains and position them as strong foundations for\nfuture medical foundation models.",

        "summary": "Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a\ncomprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.\nMoreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than\nevaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for\neach individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While\nhumans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide\neither overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in\nmisalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT\nScore (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes\nevaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments\nusing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human\nPreference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark\ndataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise\nevaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to\nmulti-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing\napproaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human\npreferences.

However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis\nyield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such\nas breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while\ncommonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this\npaper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate\nhigh-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images.

Moreover, most fMRI\ndatasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation\nand connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies\nautomatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for\nbrain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven\nfMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,\nconnectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid\nfrequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a\ncross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside\nlong-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module\nembeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a\nregularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap.

To further enhance\noutput fidelity, the framework incorporates perceptual reconstruction loss\nusing VGG features, as well as a PatchGAN-style discriminator for adversarial\nsupervision over spatial realism. Comprehensive experiments on the BTCV dataset\ndemonstrate that our approach improves segmentation accuracy, particularly in\nboundary-sensitive regions, while maintaining strong reconstruction quality.\nOur findings highlight the effectiveness of hybrid generative-discriminative\ntraining regimes for small-organ segmentation and provide new insights into\nbalancing realism, diversity, and anatomical consistency in data-scarce\nscenarios.",

        "title": "Count2Density: Crowd Density Estimation without Location-level Annotations",
        "summary": "Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at\nestimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge\nin this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,\n(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.\nCollecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses\na significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate\nthis burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict\nmeaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only\ncount-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To\nachieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past\npredictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation\nbias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to\nprovide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of\npredicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling\nlocations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with\nthe number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further\nenhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised\ncontrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations\nwithin crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\ncross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent\nstate-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several\ndatasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual\ncomponent of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to\neffectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and\nenabling accurate subregion counting.",

        "summary": "Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the\nstructure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical\noutcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,\ncurrent existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to\nexplicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time\nintervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely\nonly on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate\nintermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological\nprogression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,\nthereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for\naccurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion\nModel (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To\nbetter model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D\nuses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in\nthe generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference\nbetween baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further\nimprove the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time\nRegularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the\nbaseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline\n(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,\nthis regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We\ntrain and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the\ngeneralisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The\ncode will be available upon acceptance.",

        "summary": "Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of\nimage processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution\npathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks\nin multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of\ntraining data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it\ndifficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically\nevolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic\nconditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general\nframework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the\ndiffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the\ndiffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by\nthe same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their\nstatistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and\nreduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives\nof the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising\nprocess and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,\ndemonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and\nvisible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve\nthe best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets.

        "summary": "Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the\nforeground target while suppressing background noise and extracting\nfine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches\naddress these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,\nyet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex\nocclusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic\ncues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground\ninformation, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by\nhuman perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the\nforeground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background\ndistractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper\nproposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background\ninformation within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To\nhelp the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an\nintra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.\nSpecifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same\nsemantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between\nforeground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative\npower. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background\nregions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.\nComprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with\nresults that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.",

Adapting to a\ncontinuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably\nfaced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on\ntest-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on\nthe fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.\nHowever, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as\nmultiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for\ntest-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the\nfine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications\nwhere these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong\nlatency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$)\nthat leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of\ncontinuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it\nsuitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware\nself-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the\nquantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp\nimprovements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard\ntest-time training protocol. Our proposed protocol offers a continuous setting\nto identify the selected keyframes, allowing the end-user to control how often\nto apply test-time training.

        "title": "Enhancing Robustness in Post-Processing Watermarking: An Ensemble Attack Network Using CNNs and Transformers",
        "summary": "Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on\nin-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into\nimage generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds\nwatermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied\nto outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without\nneeding access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed\nunique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on\npost-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an\nensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of\nattack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains\nto investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the\nwatermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack\nnetwork in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the\nfrequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.\nExtensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the\nmetric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances\nthe robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In\nparticular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves\nStegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released\nat:https://github.com/aiiu-lab/DeepRobustWatermark.",

        "summary": "Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of\nmedical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have\nmade significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate\na single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,\noverlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a\nSelf-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce\na Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables\nmulti-granularity measurement between the support and query images by\nsimultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local\nprototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the\nsupport image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are\nsubstantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate\nthis issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)\nmodule, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance\nfrom the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such\ndiscrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets\ndemonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,\nachieving superior performance.",

Recent studies have utilized the integration of\nCopy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these\nstudies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and\ndiffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing\ntraining data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,\ntraining-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation\ndatasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data\ndiversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent\nfeatures a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts\nbased on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but\nalso increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.\nAdditionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the\noverall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating\nnew instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and\nefficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,\nenhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set\nindicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of\n+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the\nbaseline.

To\naddress this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM\nframework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view\ndriving frames.

While their\nextension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video\ncaptioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In\nthis work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in\npixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based\non natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify\nthe shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame\ncan often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any\ntemporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing\ntechniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video\nMLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to\ngrasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,\nMoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging\nthe interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by\nstatic appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We\nfurther establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or\noutperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation\ntechniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.\nOur motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models\nto improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within\nvideos.

        "summary": "Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote\nsensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.\nDespite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods\nfail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,\nmaking it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary\ndetails. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph\nunmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a\ntransformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive\ngraph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,\nT-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph\nstructure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a\ngraph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.\nExperimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art\nmethods.

        "summary": "In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization\ncapabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse\nclass semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively\ndetect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level\ninformation. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel\ncorrespondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering\npixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D\nrepresentation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects\nthe inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose\nPointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing\nexplicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal\nspatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry\ninformation to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To\nsimultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes\nhierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit\nanomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the\nrendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy\ncontrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between\nthe rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.\nFinally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the\ngeneralized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB\ninformation in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in\nZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class\nsemantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.",

Our\napproach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based\nfeatures and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual\nrepresentations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework\naddresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain\ngeneralization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,\nthereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive\nexperiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,\nMessidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in\ncross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,\nour symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the\ncomplete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to\nexisting published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.\nAblation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)\nsubstantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic\ncomponents act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing\ninterpretability.

        "title": "High-Fidelity Digital Twins for Bridging the Sim2Real Gap in LiDAR-Based ITS Perception",
        "summary": "Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for\ndeveloping LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,\nsegmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception\nmodels trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to\ndistributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a\nhigh-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world\nbackground geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific\nspecifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge\nunderlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing\nsimulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf\n3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated\non real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the\nequivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we\nquantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using\nmultiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy\n(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both\nraw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs\nsubstantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse\nevaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital\ntwins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world\nITS applications.",

However, the modalities available in\nclinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area\nthat stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular\nsubtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized\ntreatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable\nand loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from\nvarious modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,\nand histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our\nprimary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily\naccommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down\nwith minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,\nmaking it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a\ndual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional\nimage-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach\nresults in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new\nmultimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance\nacross a range of multimodal conditions.

The widespread use of\nopen-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the\nseverity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and\ndetection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially\nproblematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.\nIn this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military\nobject detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To\nsupport this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military\nvehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors\nfor poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:\na patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a\npositive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion\nof the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical\napplicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized\npoisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual\nindustrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of\nmethods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a\nsimple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows\npromising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the\nreconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while\nbeing less time- and memory-intensive.

Manual\ncoronary artery segmentation from these images is time-consuming and\ninefficient, prompting the development of automated models.

Moreover, current knowledge\ndistillation methods applied in this field have not fully exploited the\nhierarchical knowledge of the model, leading to certain information waste and\ninsufficient enhancement of the model's performance capabilities for\nsegmentation tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces Deep\nSelf-knowledge Distillation, a novel approach for coronary artery segmentation\nthat leverages hierarchical outputs for supervision.

        "summary": "Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem\ndynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously\nindicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent\nperformance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and\nchange moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be\ninferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,\nnamed CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure\nconsistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers\nchange area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time\nseries analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key\nsteps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,\nand Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference\nExtraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking\nis designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary\nenhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the\nCoarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the\nfirst step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two\ndistinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine\nChange Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class\nActivation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the\nchange-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change\nmoment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the\nchange moment must have undergone a change.",

        "summary": "Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited\nsensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in\nunderwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater\nVisual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN,\nwhich enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater\nvehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles\nand maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain\nwithout relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting\nlarge-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures\nrobust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater\nenvironments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model\ntransfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases:\nwe first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets\nusing a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor\non an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into\nthe trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both\nsimulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness\nand generalization of our approach.

        "summary": "Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of\nthe aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,\naccess to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often\nlimited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved\nareas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative\nbut is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most\nrelevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning\n(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each\npatient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on\na fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional\nimaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from\n2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using\nonly 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results\ndemonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS\ndiagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and\npersonalized.

        "summary": "The ability to track a user's arm pose could be valuable in a wide range of\napplications, including fitness, rehabilitation, augmented reality input, life\nlogging, and context-aware assistants. Unfortunately, this capability is not\nreadily available to consumers. Systems either require cameras, which carry\nprivacy issues, or utilize multiple worn IMUs or markers. In this work, we\ndescribe how an off-the-shelf smartphone and smartwatch can work together to\naccurately estimate arm pose. Moving beyond prior work, we take advantage of\nmore recent ultra-wideband (UWB) functionality on these devices to capture\nabsolute distance between the two devices. This measurement is the perfect\ncomplement to inertial data, which is relative and suffers from drift. We\nquantify the performance of our software-only approach using off-the-shelf\ndevices, showing it can estimate the wrist and elbow joints with a \\hl{median\npositional error of 11.0~cm}, without the user having to provide training data.",

        "summary": "This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation\non the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that\ncan be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to\nhandwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect\nhandwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,\nletters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,\nparents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been\ncollected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all\nwriters are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is\npresently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of\nhandwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing\nstyles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern\nrecognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the\neffects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.",

        "title": "Efficient Active Training for Deep LiDAR Odometry",
        "summary": "Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate\nlocalization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse\ntraining data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To\ntackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively\nextract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training\nload and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key\nstrategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental\nSelection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general\nweather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing\ndiverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base\nmodel. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under\nchallenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and\nprediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the\nmodel to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across\ndatasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably,\nour method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\\% of\nthe sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of\nour active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach\nsets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of\nnavigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.",

        "summary": "Accurate detection of mitotic figures in whole slide histopathological images\nremains a challenging task due to their scarcity, morphological heterogeneity,\nand the variability introduced by tissue preparation and staining protocols.\nThe MIDOG competition series provides standardized benchmarks for evaluating\ndetection approaches across diverse domains, thus motivating the development of\ngeneralizable deep learning models. In this work, we investigate the\nperformance of two modern one-stage detectors, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8, trained on\nMIDOG++, CMC, and CCMCT datasets. To enhance robustness, training incorporated\nstain-invariant color perturbations and texture preserving augmentations. In\ninternal validation, YOLOv5 achieved superior precision, while YOLOv8 provided\nimproved recall, reflecting architectural trade-offs between anchor-based and\nanchor-free detection. To capitalize on these complementary strengths, we\nemployed an ensemble of the two models, which improved sensitivity without a\nmajor reduction in precision. These findings highlight the effectiveness of\nensemble strategies built upon contemporary object detectors to advance\nautomated mitosis detection in digital pathology.",
