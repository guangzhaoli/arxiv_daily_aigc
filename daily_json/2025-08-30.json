        "summary": "Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated\nimpressive capabilities across various multimodal tasks. They continue,\nhowever, to struggle with trivial scenarios such as reading values from Digital\nMeasurement Devices (DMDs), particularly in real-world conditions involving\nclutter, occlusions, extreme viewpoints, and motion blur; common in\nhead-mounted cameras and Augmented Reality (AR) applications. Motivated by\nthese limitations, this work introduces CAD2DMD-SET, a synthetic data\ngeneration tool designed to support visual question answering (VQA) tasks\ninvolving DMDs. By leveraging 3D CAD models, advanced rendering, and\nhigh-fidelity image composition, our tool produces diverse, VQA-labelled\nsynthetic DMD datasets suitable for fine-tuning LVLMs. Additionally, we present\nDMDBench, a curated validation set of 1,000 annotated real-world images\ndesigned to evaluate model performance under practical constraints.\nBenchmarking three state-of-the-art LVLMs using Average Normalised Levenshtein\nSimilarity (ANLS) and further fine-tuning LoRA's of these models with\nCAD2DMD-SET's generated dataset yielded substantial improvements, with InternVL\nshowcasing a score increase of 200% without degrading on other tasks. This\ndemonstrates that the CAD2DMD-SET training dataset substantially improves the\nrobustness and performance of LVLMs when operating under the previously stated\nchallenging conditions. The CAD2DMD-SET tool is expected to be released as\nopen-source once the final version of this manuscript is prepared, allowing the\ncommunity to add different measurement devices and generate their own datasets.",

        "summary": "Synthetic medical data offers a scalable solution for training robust models,\nbut significant domain gaps limit its generalizability to real-world clinical\nsettings. This paper addresses the challenge of cross-domain translation\nbetween synthetic and real X-ray images of the head, focusing on bridging\ndiscrepancies in attenuation behavior, noise characteristics, and soft tissue\nrepresentation. We propose MedShift, a unified class-conditional generative\nmodel based on Flow Matching and Schrodinger Bridges, which enables\nhigh-fidelity, unpaired image translation across multiple domains. Unlike prior\napproaches that require domain-specific training or rely on paired data,\nMedShift learns a shared domain-agnostic latent space and supports seamless\ntranslation between any pair of domains seen during training. We introduce\nX-DigiSkull, a new dataset comprising aligned synthetic and real skull X-rays\nunder varying radiation doses, to benchmark domain translation models.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, despite its smaller model size compared\nto diffusion-based approaches, MedShift offers strong performance and remains\nflexible at inference time, as it can be tuned to prioritize either perceptual\nfidelity or structural consistency, making it a scalable and generalizable\nsolution for domain adaptation in medical imaging.

        "summary": "Understanding temporal dynamics in medical imaging is crucial for\napplications such as disease progression modeling, treatment planning and\nanatomical development tracking. However, most deep learning methods either\nconsider only single temporal contexts, or focus on tasks like classification\nor regression, limiting their ability for fine-grained spatial predictions.\nWhile some approaches have been explored, they are often limited to single\ntimepoints, specific diseases or have other technical restrictions. To address\nthis fundamental gap, we introduce Temporal Flow Matching (TFM), a unified\ngenerative trajectory method that (i) aims to learn the underlying temporal\ndistribution, (ii) by design can fall back to a nearest image predictor, i.e.\npredicting the last context image (LCI), as a special case, and (iii) supports\n$3D$ volumes, multiple prior scans, and irregular sampling. Extensive\nbenchmarks on three public longitudinal datasets show that TFM consistently\nsurpasses spatio-temporal methods from natural imaging, establishing a new\nstate-of-the-art and robust baseline for $4D$ medical image prediction.",

        "summary": "Context recognition (SR) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims\nto extract structured semantic summaries from images by identifying key events\nand their associated entities. Specifically, given an input image, the model\nmust first classify the main visual events (verb classification), then identify\nthe participating entities and their semantic roles (semantic role labeling),\nand finally localize these entities in the image (semantic role localization).\nExisting methods treat verb classification as a single-label problem, but we\nshow through a comprehensive analysis that this formulation fails to address\nthe inherent ambiguity in visual event recognition, as multiple verb categories\nmay reasonably describe the same image. This paper makes three key\ncontributions: First, we reveal through empirical analysis that verb\nclassification is inherently a multi-label problem due to the ubiquitous\nsemantic overlap between verb categories. Second, given the impracticality of\nfully annotating large-scale datasets with multiple labels, we propose to\nreformulate verb classification as a single positive multi-label learning\n(SPMLL) problem - a novel perspective in SR research. Third, we design a\ncomprehensive multi-label evaluation benchmark for SR that is carefully\ndesigned to fairly evaluate model performance in a multi-label setting. To\naddress the challenges of SPMLL, we futher develop the Graph Enhanced Verb\nMultilayer Perceptron (GE-VerbMLP), which combines graph neural networks to\ncapture label correlations and adversarial training to optimize decision\nboundaries.

We also provide a non-parametric learning solution for the\nunder-explored problem of unsupervised video continual learning. Videos\nrepresent a complex and rich spatio-temporal media information, widely used in\nmany applications, but which have not been sufficiently explored in\nunsupervised continual learning. Prior studies have only focused on supervised\ncontinual learning, relying on the knowledge of labels and task boundaries,\nwhile having labeled data is costly and not practical. To address this gap, we\nstudy the unsupervised video continual learning (uVCL). uVCL raises more\nchallenges due to the additional computational and memory requirements of\nprocessing videos when compared to images. We introduce a general benchmark\nexperimental protocol for uVCL by considering the learning of unstructured\nvideo data categories during each task. We propose to use the Kernel Density\nEstimation (KDE) of deep embedded video features extracted by unsupervised\nvideo transformer networks as a non-parametric probabilistic representation of\nthe data. We introduce a novelty detection criterion for the incoming new task\ndata, dynamically enabling the expansion of memory clusters, aiming to capture\nnew knowledge when learning a succession of tasks. We leverage the use of\ntransfer learning from the previous tasks as an initial state for the knowledge\ntransfer to the current learning task.

        "summary": "Humans usually show exceptional generalisation and discovery ability in the\nopen world, when being shown uncommon new concepts. Whereas most existing\nstudies in the literature focus on common typical data from closed sets,\nopen-world novel discovery is under-explored in videos. In this paper, we are\ninterested in asking: \\textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in\nthe learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting\nof various types of unusual atypical data (\\eg sci-fi, animation, \\etc). To\nstudy how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into\nthe model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key\ntasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel\ncategory discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found\nthat even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently\nimprove performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that\nincreasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD\ndetection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more\nsemantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance\ncompared to using a larger but more typical dataset. In the ZSAR setting, the\nsemantic diversity of atypical videos helps the model generalise better to\nunseen action classes. These observations in our extensive experimental\nevaluations reveal the benefits of atypical videos for visual representation\nlearning in the open world, together with the newly proposed dataset,\nencouraging further studies in this direction.",

        "summary": "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the foundation of modern\ncomputer vision, achieving unprecedented accuracy across diverse image\nrecognition tasks. While these networks excel on in-distribution data, they\nremain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations imperceptible input\nmodifications that cause misclassification with high confidence. However,\nexisting detection methods either require expensive retraining, modify network\narchitecture, or degrade performance on clean inputs. Here we show that\nadversarial perturbations create immediate, detectable entropy signatures in\nCNN activations that can be monitored without any model modification. Using\nparallel entropy monitoring on VGG-16, we demonstrate that adversarial inputs\nconsistently shift activation entropy by 7% in early convolutional layers,\nenabling 90% detection accuracy with false positives and false negative rates\nbelow 20%. The complete separation between clean and adversarial entropy\ndistributions reveals that CNNs inherently encode distribution shifts in their\nactivation patterns. This work establishes that CNN reliability can be assessed\nthrough activation entropy alone, enabling practical deployment of\nself-diagnostic vision systems that detect adversarial inputs in real-time\nwithout compromising original model performance.",

To address these limitations, we\npropose Flux LoRA Augmentation (FLORA), a lightweight synthetic data generation\npipeline. Our approach uses the Flux 1.1 Dev diffusion model, fine-tuned\nexclusively through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). This dramatically reduces\ncomputational requirements, enabling synthetic dataset generation with a\nconsumer-grade GPU (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090). We empirically evaluate our\napproach on seven diverse object detection datasets. Our results demonstrate\nthat training object detectors with just 500 synthetic images generated by our\napproach yields superior detection performance compared to models trained on\n5000 synthetic images from the ODGEN baseline, achieving improvements of up to\n21.3% in mAP@.50:.95. This work demonstrates that it is possible to surpass\nstate-of-the-art performance with far greater efficiency, as FLORA achieves\nsuperior results using only 10% of the data and a fraction of the computational\ncost. This work demonstrates that a quality and efficiency-focused approach is\nmore effective than brute-force generation, making advanced synthetic data\ncreation more practical and accessible for real-world scenarios.",

        "summary": "Constructing high-definition (HD) maps from sensory input requires accurately\nmapping the road elements in image space to the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space.\nThe precision of this mapping directly impacts the quality of the final\nvectorized HD map. Existing HD mapping approaches outsource the projection to\nstandard mapping techniques, such as attention-based ones. However, these\nmethods struggle with accuracy due to generalization problems, often\nhallucinating non-existent road elements. Our key idea is to start with a\ngeometric mapping based on camera parameters and adapt it to the scene to\nextract relevant map information from camera images. To implement this, we\npropose a novel probabilistic projection mechanism with confidence scores to\n(i) refine the mapping to better align with the scene and (ii) filter out\nirrelevant elements that should not influence HD map generation. In addition,\nwe improve temporal processing by using confidence scores to selectively\naccumulate reliable information over time. Experiments on new splits of the\nnuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate improved performance over\nstate-of-the-art approaches, indicating better generalization. The improvements\nare particularly pronounced on nuScenes and in the challenging long perception\nrange.

We propose a latent\ndiffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,\nincluding the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.\nCompleting the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the\nambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a\nregression-based formulation to predict a single \"mode\" for occluded and\nout-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to\ncapture multiple possible explanations. Thus, they often address this problem\npartially, focusing either on objects isolated from the background,\nreconstructing only visible surfaces, or failing to extrapolate far from the\ninput views. In contrast, we propose a generative formulation to learn a\ndistribution of 3D representations of Gaussian splats conditioned on a single\ninput image. To address the lack of ground-truth training data, we propose a\nVariational AutoReconstructor to learn a latent space only from 2D images in a\nself-supervised manner, over which a diffusion model is trained. Our method\ngenerates faithful reconstructions and diverse samples with the ability to\ncomplete the occluded surfaces for high-quality 360-degree renderings.",

        "title": "ELV-Halluc: Benchmarking Semantic Aggregation Hallucinations in Long Video Understanding",
        "summary": "Video multimodal large language models (Video-MLLMs) have achieved remarkable\nprogress in video understanding. However, they remain vulnerable to\nhallucination-producing content inconsistent with or unrelated to video inputs.\nPrevious video hallucination benchmarks primarily focus on short-videos. They\nattribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing\nframes, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these\ncauses indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still\noversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect\noutputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of\nhallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during\nthe process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic\ngroups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to\nincreased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to\nseparate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.\nTo address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark\ndedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of\nSAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases\nwith semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to\nSAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to\nmitigate SAH. We demonstrate that positional encoding strategy contributes to\nalleviating SAH, and further adopt DPO strategy to enhance the model's ability\nto distinguish semantics within and across events. To support this, we curate a\ndataset of 8K adversarial data pairs and achieve improvements on both\nELV-Halluc and Video-MME, including a substantial 27.7% reduction in SAH ratio.",

        "summary": "Current ship detection techniques based on remote sensing imagery primarily\nrely on the object detection capabilities of deep neural networks (DNNs).\nHowever, DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can lead to\nmisclassification by the detection model or complete evasion of the targets.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated that data transformation-based methods can\nimprove the transferability of adversarial examples. However, excessive\naugmentation of image backgrounds or irrelevant regions may introduce\nunnecessary interference, resulting in false detections of the object detection\nmodel. These errors are not caused by the adversarial patches themselves but\nrather by the over-augmentation of background and non-target areas. This paper\nproposes a localized augmentation method that applies augmentation only to the\ntarget regions, avoiding any influence on non-target areas. By reducing\nbackground interference, this approach enables the loss function to focus more\ndirectly on the impact of the adversarial patch on the detection model, thereby\nimproving the attack success rate. Experiments conducted on the HRSC2016\ndataset demonstrate that the proposed method effectively increases the success\nrate of adversarial patch attacks and enhances their transferability.",

        "summary": "Image captioning is fundamental for applications like video instruction\nsystems and exploration robots, yet deploying such models on local devices is\nchallenging due to the high computational demands of multimodal large language\nmodels (MLLMs). To address this, we first explore lightweight captioning by\nimplementing a specialist based on a 125M-parameter language model, 56 times\nsmaller than LLaMA-7B, and evaluating its performance on both single-sentence\nand detailed captioning tasks. Surprisingly, we find that our model can achieve\nperformance comparable to large multimodal generalists, suggesting its\npotential to serve as a strong visual specialist for on-device applications.\nWhile promising, our model also exhibits a limitation: like other MLLMs, it\nsuffers from visual blindness, occasionally resulting in semantic captioning\nerrors. We carry out toy experiments and investigate the underlying causes,\nwhere we observe that the problems arise from ineffective attention mechanisms\nand limited visual representations. To alleviate them, we develop a novel\ncaptioning framework, Sharp-Eyed Refinement, which enhances caption quality\nthrough improved visual grounding. At its core, our DeepLens extracts detailed\nvisual representations by concentrating on informative regions identified\nduring the initial glance. Our experiments confirm both the advantages of our\nspecialist over prior small captioning models and large generalists and the\neffectiveness of our framework.",

These images can be\nviewed, analyzed, shared digitally, and are used today for Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) algorithm development. WSIs are used in a variety of fields,\nincluding pathology for diagnosing diseases and oncology for cancer research.\nThey are also utilized in neurology, veterinary medicine, hematology,\nmicrobiology, dermatology, pharmacology, toxicology, immunology, and forensic\nscience.\n  When assembling cohorts for the training or validation of an AI algorithm, it\nis essential to know what is present on such a WSI. However, there is currently\nno standard for this metadata, so such selection has mainly been done through\nmanual inspection, which is not suitable for large collections with several\nmillion objects.\n  We propose a general framework to generate a 2D index map for WSI and a\nprofiling mechanism for specific application domains. We demonstrate this\napproach in the field of clinical pathology, using common syntax and semantics\nto achieve interoperability between different catalogs.\n  Our approach augments each WSI collection with a detailed tissue map that\nprovides fine-grained information about the WSI content. The tissue map is\norganized into three layers: source, tissue type, and pathological alterations,\nwith each layer assigning segments of the WSI to specific classes.\n  We illustrate the advantages and applicability of the proposed standard\nthrough specific examples in WSI catalogs, Machine Learning (ML), and\ngraph-based WSI representations.",

HTP operates in a staged, top-down manner: (1)\nTemporal Correlation-Enhanced Pruning (TCEP) identifies essential frames by\nanalyzing inter-frame motion correlations through adaptive temporal graph\nconstruction; (2) Sparse-Focused Temporal MHSA (SFT MHSA) leverages the\nresulting frame-level sparsity to reduce attention computation, focusing on\nmotion-relevant tokens; and (3) Mask-Guided Pose Token Pruner (MGPTP) performs\nfine-grained semantic pruning via clustering, retaining only the most\ninformative pose tokens.

        "summary": "We introduce PHD, a novel approach for personalized 3D human mesh recovery\n(HMR) and body fitting that leverages user-specific shape information to\nimprove pose estimation accuracy from videos. Traditional HMR methods are\ndesigned to be user-agnostic and optimized for generalization. While these\nmethods often refine poses using constraints derived from the 2D image to\nimprove alignment, this process compromises 3D accuracy by failing to jointly\naccount for person-specific body shapes and the plausibility of 3D poses. In\ncontrast, our pipeline decouples this process by first calibrating the user's\nbody shape and then employing a personalized pose fitting process conditioned\non that shape. To achieve this, we develop a body shape-conditioned 3D pose\nprior, implemented as a Point Diffusion Transformer, which iteratively guides\nthe pose fitting via a Point Distillation Sampling loss. This learned 3D pose\nprior effectively mitigates errors arising from an over-reliance on 2D\nconstraints. Consequently, our approach improves not only pelvis-aligned pose\naccuracy but also absolute pose accuracy -- an important metric often\noverlooked by prior work. Furthermore, our method is highly data-efficient,\nrequiring only synthetic data for training, and serves as a versatile\nplug-and-play module that can be seamlessly integrated with existing 3D pose\nestimators to enhance their performance.

We acquire this \"spin\nprior\" by learning a generative diffusion model from the multiparametric\nSAturation-recovery single-SHot acquisition sequence (mSASHA) dataset, which\noffers joint cardiac T1 and T2 maps. Our method enables approximate but\nmeaningful spin-property estimates from MR images, which provide an\ninterpretable \"latent variable\" that lead to highly flexible image synthesis of\narbitrary novel sequences. We show that Reverse Imaging enables highly accurate\nsegmentation across vastly different image contrasts and imaging protocols,\nrealizing wide-spectrum generalization of cardiac MRI segmentation.",

        "summary": "The reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have\ngarnered a lot of attention in recent times, with advances made in frontiers\nlike coding, mathematics, and science. However, very limited experiments have\nbeen done to assess their performance in simple perception tasks performed over\nuncontaminated, generated images containing basic shapes and structures. To\naddress this issue, the paper introduces a dataset, Percept-V, containing a\ntotal of 7200 program-generated images equally divided into 30 categories, each\ntesting a combination of visual perception skills. Unlike previously proposed\ndatasets, Percept-V comprises very basic tasks of varying complexity that test\nthe perception abilities of MLLMs. This dataset is then tested on\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude as well as Large\nReasoning Models (LRMs) like OpenAI o4-mini and DeepSeek R1 to gauge their\nperformance. Contrary to the evidence that MLLMs excel in many complex tasks,\nour experiments show a significant drop in the models' performance with\nincreasing problem complexity across all categories. An analysis of the\nperformances also reveals that the tested MLLMs exhibit a similar trend in\naccuracy across categories, testing a particular cognitive skill and find some\nskills to be more difficult than others.",

        "summary": "Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables the acquisition of\nhigh-resolution, three-dimensional fingerprint data, capturing rich subsurface\nstructures for robust biometric recognition. However, the high cost and\ntime-consuming nature of OCT data acquisition have led to a scarcity of\nlarge-scale public datasets, significantly hindering the development of\nadvanced algorithms, particularly data-hungry deep learning models. To address\nthis critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework\nfor generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D\nfingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D\nstyle transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale\nimages mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D\nStructure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D\nanatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that\nrenders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other\nimaging characteristics. Using Print2Volume, we generated a large-scale\nsynthetic dataset of 420,000 samples. Quantitative experiments demonstrate the\nhigh quality of our synthetic data and its significant impact on recognition\nperformance. By pre-training a recognition model on our synthetic data and\nfine-tuning it on a small real-world dataset, we achieved a remarkable\nreduction in the Equal Error Rate (EER) from 15.62% to 2.50% on the ZJUT-EIFD\nbenchmark, proving the effectiveness of our approach in overcoming data\nscarcity.",

In this work, we\nintroduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,\nfeaturing advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron\nhighlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive\ninfrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.\nIt not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to\nenhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment\nconnecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised\nfinetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and\nthen develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex\nreasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves\nsuperior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.\nIn particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier\nChinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities\neven in state-of-the-art solutions. To this end, we manually collect over one\nmillion steps of operation trajectories across the top 100 most popular apps,\nand build the offline and online agent evaluation environments.

For computational efficiency these\ndescriptors are often patch-based, and so struggle to represent the fine\nfeatures often present in micrographs; they also struggle with the large image\nsizes present in materials and biological image analysis. In this work, we\ntrain a convolutional neural network to upsample low-resolution (i.e, large\npatch size) foundation model features with reference to the input image. We\napply this upsampler network (without any further training) to efficiently\nfeaturise and then segment a variety of microscopy images, including plant\ncells, a lithium-ion battery cathode and organic crystals. The richness of\nthese upsampled features admits separation of hard to segment phases, like\nhairline cracks.

Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently\nchallenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better\nassess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP\nencounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating\non 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after\nfine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'\nsome domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance\ndeteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present\nCLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware\nrepresentations). Our approach is motivated by the observation that while\nstandard domain invariance losses aim to make representations domain-invariant,\nthis can be harmful to foundation models by forcing the discarding of\ndomain-aware representations beneficial for generalization. We instead\nhypothesize that enhancing domain awareness is a prerequisite for effective\ndomain-invariant classification in foundation models. CLIP-DCA identifies and\nenhances domain awareness within CLIP's encoders using a separate domain head\nand synthetically generated diverse domain data. Simultaneously, it encourages\ndomain-invariant classification through disentanglement from the domain\nfeatures.

Rural livability is a key indicator for\nmeasuring the effectiveness of these efforts. Current measurement approaches\nface significant limitations, as questionnaire-based methods are difficult to\nscale, while urban-oriented visual perception methods are poorly suited for\nrural contexts. In this paper, a rural-specific livability assessment framework\nwas proposed based on drone imagery and multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). To comprehensively assess village livability, this study first used a\ntop-down approach to collect large-scale drone imagery of 1,766 villages in 146\ncounties across China. In terms of the model framework, an efficient image\ncomparison mechanism was developed, incorporating binary search interpolation\nto determine effective image pairs while reducing comparison iterations.\nBuilding on expert knowledge, a chain-of-thought prompting suitable for\nnationwide rural livability measurement was constructed, considering both\nliving quality and ecological habitability dimensions. This approach enhanced\nthe rationality and reliability of the livability assessment. Finally, this\nstudy characterized the spatial heterogeneity of rural livability across China\nand thoroughly analyzed its influential factors. The results show that: (1) The\nrural livability in China demonstrates a dual-core-periphery spatial pattern,\nradiating outward from Sichuan and Zhejiang provinces with declining gradients;\n(2) Among various influential factors, government fiscal expenditure emerged as\nthe core determinant, with each unit increase corresponding to a 3.9 - 4.9 unit\nenhancement in livability. The findings provide valuable insights for rural\nconstruction policy-making.",

We find that the subspace of insignificant components more effectively\ndistinguishes ID from OOD data than raw activations in regimes of large\ndistribution shifts (Far-OOD). This occurs because the classification objective\nleaves the insignificant subspace largely unaffected, yielding features that\nare ''untainted'' by the target classification task.

        "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-fidelity real-time rendering, a key\nrequirement for immersive applications. However, the extension of 3DGS to\ndynamic scenes remains limitations on the substantial data volume of dense\nGaussians and the prolonged training time required for each frame. This paper\npresents \\M, a scalable Gaussian Splatting framework designed for efficient\ntraining in streaming tasks. Specifically, Gaussian spheres are hierarchically\norganized by scale within an anchor-based structure. Coarser-level Gaussians\nrepresent the low-resolution structure of the scene, while finer-level\nGaussians, responsible for detailed high-fidelity rendering, are selectively\nactivated by the coarser-level Gaussians. To further reduce computational\noverhead, we introduce a hybrid deformation and spawning strategy that models\nmotion of inter-frame through Gaussian deformation and triggers Gaussian\nspawning to characterize wide-range motion. Additionally, a bidirectional\nadaptive masking mechanism enhances training efficiency by removing static\nregions and prioritizing informative viewpoints. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that \\M~ achieves superior visual quality while significantly\nreducing training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "summary": "Trees are key components of the terrestrial biosphere, playing vital roles in\necosystem function, climate regulation, and the bioeconomy. However,\nlarge-scale monitoring of individual trees remains limited by inadequate\nmodelling. Available global products have focused on binary tree cover or\ncanopy height, which do not explicitely identify trees at individual level. In\nthis study, we present a deep learning approach for detecting large individual\ntrees in 3-m resolution PlanetScope imagery at a global scale. We simulate tree\ncrowns with Gaussian kernels of scalable size, allowing the extraction of crown\ncenters and the generation of binary tree cover maps. Training is based on\nbillions of points automatically extracted from airborne lidar data, enabling\nthe model to successfully identify trees both inside and outside forests. We\ncompare against existing tree cover maps and airborne lidar with\nstate-of-the-art performance (fractional cover R$^2 = 0.81$ against aerial\nlidar), report balanced detection metrics across biomes, and demonstrate how\ndetection can be further improved through fine-tuning with manual labels.

        "title": "Radially Distorted Homographies, Revisited",
        "summary": "Homographies are among the most prevalent transformations occurring in\ngeometric computer vision and projective geometry, and homography estimation is\nconsequently a crucial step in a wide assortment of computer vision tasks. When\nworking with real images, which are often afflicted with geometric distortions\ncaused by the camera lens, it may be necessary to determine both the homography\nand the lens distortion-particularly the radial component, called radial\ndistortion-simultaneously to obtain anything resembling useful estimates. When\nconsidering a homography with radial distortion between two images, there are\nthree conceptually distinct configurations for the radial distortion; (i)\ndistortion in only one image, (ii) identical distortion in the two images, and\n(iii) independent distortion in the two images. While these cases have been\naddressed separately in the past, the present paper provides a novel and\nunified approach to solve all three cases. We demonstrate how the proposed\napproach can be used to construct new fast, stable, and accurate minimal\nsolvers for radially distorted homographies. In all three cases, our proposed\nsolvers are faster than the existing state-of-the-art solvers while maintaining\nsimilar accuracy. The solvers are tested on well-established benchmarks\nincluding images taken with fisheye cameras. The source code for our solvers\nwill be made available in the event our paper is accepted for publication.",

        "summary": "Anomaly detection, which aims to identify anomalies deviating from normal\npatterns, is challenging due to the limited amount of normal data available.\nUnlike most existing unified methods that rely on carefully designed image\nfeature extractors and memory banks to capture logical relationships between\nobjects, we introduce a text memory bank to enhance the detection of logical\nanomalies. Specifically, we propose a Three-Memory framework for Unified\nstructural and logical Anomaly Detection (TMUAD). First, we build a class-level\ntext memory bank for logical anomaly detection by the proposed logic-aware text\nextractor, which can capture rich logical descriptions of objects from input\nimages. Second, we construct an object-level image memory bank that preserves\ncomplete object contours by extracting features from segmented objects. Third,\nwe employ visual encoders to extract patch-level image features for\nconstructing a patch-level memory bank for structural anomaly detection. These\nthree complementary memory banks are used to retrieve and compare normal images\nthat are most similar to the query image, compute anomaly scores at multiple\nlevels, and fuse them into a final anomaly score. By unifying structural and\nlogical anomaly detection through collaborative memory banks, TMUAD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across seven publicly available datasets involving\nindustrial and medical domains.

        "summary": "Heart rate prediction is vital for personalized health monitoring and\nfitness, while it frequently faces a critical challenge when deploying in\nreal-world: data heterogeneity. We classify it in two key dimensions: source\nheterogeneity from fragmented device markets with varying feature sets, and\nuser heterogeneity reflecting distinct physiological patterns across\nindividuals and activities. Existing methods either discard device-specific\ninformation, or fail to model user-specific differences, limiting their\nreal-world performance. To address this, we propose a framework that learns\nlatent representations agnostic to both heterogeneity, enabling downstream\npredictors to work consistently under heterogeneous data patterns.\nSpecifically, we introduce a random feature dropout strategy to handle source\nheterogeneity, making the model robust to various feature sets. To manage user\nheterogeneity, we employ a time-aware attention module to capture long-term\nphysiological traits and use a contrastive learning objective to build a\ndiscriminative representation space. To reflect the heterogeneous nature of\nreal-world data, we created and publicly released a new benchmark dataset,\nParroTao. Evaluations on both ParroTao and the public FitRec dataset show that\nour model significantly outperforms existing baselines by 17% and 15%,\nrespectively. Furthermore, analysis of the learned representations demonstrates\ntheir strong discriminative power, and one downstream application task confirm\nthe practical value of our model.",

While fully automated\nmethods have advanced substantially, clinical practice benefits from approaches\nthat keep humans in the loop to efficiently refine predicted masks. The\nautoPET/CT IV challenge addresses this need by introducing interactive\nsegmentation tasks based on simulated user prompts. In this work, we present\nour submission to Task 1. Building on the winning autoPET III nnU-Net pipeline,\nwe extend the framework with promptable capabilities by encoding user-provided\nforeground and background clicks as additional input channels. We\nsystematically investigate representations for spatial prompts and demonstrate\nthat Euclidean Distance Transform (EDT) encodings consistently outperform\nGaussian kernels. Furthermore, we propose online simulation of user\ninteractions and a custom point sampling strategy to improve robustness under\nrealistic prompting conditions. Our ensemble of EDT-based models, trained with\nand without external data, achieves the strongest cross-validation performance,\nreducing both false positives and false negatives compared to baseline models.\nThese results highlight the potential of promptable models to enable efficient,\nuser-guided segmentation workflows in multi-tracer, multi-center PET/CT.

However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of\nannotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden\n(O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting\nalgorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering\nitems using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model\nhierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human\ncomparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a\nCLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores,\nand finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation\nwas conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical\nimage chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It\nshowed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to\nexhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n =\n100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results\ndemonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling\nyields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.",

        "summary": "Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for neural networks\noperating in open-world settings, particularly in safety-critical applications.\nExisting methods have improved OOD detection by leveraging two main techniques:\nfeature truncation, which increases the separation between in-distribution (ID)\nand OOD samples, and scoring functions, which assign scores to distinguish\nbetween ID and OOD data. However, most approaches either focus on a single\nfamily of techniques or evaluate their effectiveness on a specific type of OOD\ndataset, overlooking the potential of combining multiple existing solutions.\nMotivated by this observation, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate\nthat state-of-the-art feature truncation and scoring functions can be\neffectively combined. Moreover, we show that aggregating multiple scoring\nfunctions enhances robustness against various types of OOD samples. Based on\nthese insights, we propose the Multi-Method Ensemble (MME) score, which unifies\nstate-of-the-art OOD detectors into a single, more effective scoring function.\nExtensive experiments on both large-scale and small-scale benchmarks, covering\nnear-OOD and far-OOD scenarios, show that MME significantly outperforms recent\nstate-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks. Notably, using the BiT model,\nour method achieves an average FPR95 of 27.57% on the challenging ImageNet-1K\nbenchmark, improving performance by 6% over the best existing baseline.",

This work builds upon SuGaR by introducing two complementary\nregularization strategies that address common limitations in both the shape of\nindividual Gaussians and the coherence of the overall surface. The first\nstrategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent\nstudies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages\nextreme anisotropy-specifically, \"needle-like\" shapes-by favoring more\nbalanced, \"disk-like\" forms that are better suited for stable surface\nreconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance\nFunction (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an\nEikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous\nglobal surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the\nunderlying geometry. These two regularizations aim to improve both the fidelity\nof individual Gaussian primitives and their collective surface behavior.

        "summary": "Current object re-identification (ReID) methods train domain-specific models\n(e.g., for persons or vehicles), which lack generalization and demand costly\nlabeled data for new categories. While self-supervised learning reduces\nannotation needs by learning instance-wise invariance, it struggles to capture\n\\textit{identity-sensitive} features critical for ReID. This paper proposes\nVisual In-Context Prompting~(VICP), a novel framework where models trained on\nseen categories can directly generalize to unseen novel categories using only\n\\textit{in-context examples} as prompts, without requiring parameter\nadaptation. VICP synergizes LLMs and vision foundation models~(VFM): LLMs infer\nsemantic identity rules from few-shot positive/negative pairs through\ntask-specific prompting, which then guides a VFM (\\eg, DINO) to extract\nID-discriminative features via \\textit{dynamic visual prompts}. By aligning\nLLM-derived semantic concepts with the VFM's pre-trained prior, VICP enables\ngeneralization to novel categories, eliminating the need for dataset-specific\nretraining.

To address this, we propose the\nHierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)\nframework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive\nLearning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures\nhierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with\nglobal text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),\nwhich dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic\nconsistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional\nreasoning. Moreover, drone text descriptions are often incomplete or ambiguous,\ndestabilizing alignment. HCCM introduces a Momentum Contrast and Distillation\n(MCD) mechanism to improve robustness.

        "summary": "Gynecologic laparoscopy as a type of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) is\nperformed via a live feed of a patient's abdomen surveying the insertion and\nhandling of various instruments for conducting treatment. Adopting this kind of\nsurgical intervention not only facilitates a great variety of treatments, the\npossibility of recording said video streams is as well essential for numerous\npost-surgical activities, such as treatment planning, case documentation and\neducation. Nonetheless, the process of manually analyzing surgical recordings,\nas it is carried out in current practice, usually proves tediously\ntime-consuming. In order to improve upon this situation, more sophisticated\ncomputer vision as well as machine learning approaches are actively developed.\nSince most of such approaches heavily rely on sample data, which especially in\nthe medical field is only sparsely available, with this work we publish the\nGynecologic Laparoscopy ENdometriosis DAtaset (GLENDA) - an image dataset\ncontaining region-based annotations of a common medical condition named\nendometriosis, i.e. the dislocation of uterine-like tissue.

        "summary": "Introduction: Large language models (LLM) have shown great potential in\nclinical decision support. GPT-5 is a novel LLM system that has been\nspecifically marketed towards oncology use.\n  Methods: Performance was assessed using two complementary benchmarks: (i) the\nACR Radiation Oncology In-Training Examination (TXIT, 2021), comprising 300\nmultiple-choice items, and (ii) a curated set of 60 authentic radiation\noncologic vignettes representing diverse disease sites and treatment\nindications. For the vignette evaluation, GPT-5 was instructed to generate\nconcise therapeutic plans. Four board-certified radiation oncologists rated\ncorrectness, comprehensiveness, and hallucinations. Inter-rater reliability was\nquantified using Fleiss' \\k{appa}.\n  Results: On the TXIT benchmark, GPT-5 achieved a mean accuracy of 92.8%,\noutperforming GPT-4 (78.8%) and GPT-3.5 (62.1%). Domain-specific gains were\nmost pronounced in Dose and Diagnosis. In the vignette evaluation, GPT-5's\ntreatment recommendations were rated highly for correctness (mean 3.24/4, 95%\nCI: 3.11-3.38) and comprehensiveness (3.59/4, 95% CI: 3.49-3.69).\nHallucinations were rare with no case reaching majority consensus for their\npresence. Inter-rater agreement was low (Fleiss' \\k{appa} 0.083 for\ncorrectness), reflecting inherent variability in clinical judgment. Errors\nclustered in complex scenarios requiring precise trial knowledge or detailed\nclinical adaptation.\n  Discussion: GPT-5 clearly outperformed prior model variants on the radiation\noncology multiple-choice benchmark. Although GPT-5 exhibited favorable\nperformance in generating real-world radiation oncology treatment\nrecommendations, correctness ratings indicate room for further improvement.\nWhile hallucinations were infrequent, the presence of substantive errors\nunderscores that GPT-5-generated recommendations require rigorous expert\noversight before clinical implementation.",

        "title": "Learning from Silence and Noise for Visual Sound Source Localization",
        "summary": "Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims\nto detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite\nrecent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most\napproaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic\ncorrespondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the\npresence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to\npositive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single\nvisible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key\ncontributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates\nsilence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being\nmore robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model,\nSSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other\nself-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval.\nSecond, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment\nand separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative\naudio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of\nthe IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio.\n  Our data, metrics and code are available on the\nhttps://xavijuanola.github.io/SSL-SaN/.",

        "title": "Why Stop at Words? Unveiling the Bigger Picture through Line-Level OCR",
        "summary": "Conventional optical character recognition (OCR) techniques segmented each\ncharacter and then recognized. This made them prone to error in character\nsegmentation, and devoid of context to exploit language models. Advances in\nsequence to sequence translation in last decade led to modern techniques first\ndetecting words and then inputting one word at a time to a model to directly\noutput full words as sequence of characters. This allowed better utilization of\nlanguage models and bypass error-prone character segmentation step. We observe\nthat the above transition in style has moved the bottleneck in accuracy to word\nsegmentation. Hence, in this paper, we propose a natural and logical\nprogression from word level OCR to line-level OCR. The proposal allows to\nbypass errors in word detection, and provides larger sentence context for\nbetter utilization of language models. We show that the proposed technique not\nonly improves the accuracy but also efficiency of OCR. Despite our thorough\nliterature survey, we did not find any public dataset to train and benchmark\nsuch shift from word to line-level OCR. Hence, we also contribute a\nmeticulously curated dataset of 251 English page images with line-level\nannotations. Our experimentation revealed a notable end-to-end accuracy\nimprovement of 5.4%, underscoring the potential benefits of transitioning\ntowards line-level OCR, especially for document images. We also report a 4\ntimes improvement in efficiency compared to word-based pipelines. With\ncontinuous improvements in large language models, our methodology also holds\npotential to exploit such advances. Project Website:\nhttps://nishitanand.github.io/line-level-ocr-website",

        "summary": "User interface (UI) agents promise to make inaccessible or complex UIs easier\nto access for blind and low-vision (BLV) users. However, current UI agents\ntypically perform tasks end-to-end without involving users in critical choices\nor making them aware of important contextual information, thus reducing user\nagency. For example, in our field study, a BLV participant asked to buy the\ncheapest available sparkling water, and the agent automatically chose one from\nseveral equally priced options, without mentioning alternative products with\ndifferent flavors or better ratings. To address this problem, we introduce\nMorae, a UI agent that automatically identifies decision points during task\nexecution and pauses so that users can make choices. Morae uses large\nmultimodal models to interpret user queries alongside UI code and screenshots,\nand prompt users for clarification when there is a choice to be made. In a\nstudy over real-world web tasks with BLV participants, Morae helped users\ncomplete more tasks and select options that better matched their preferences,\nas compared to baseline agents, including OpenAI Operator. More broadly, this\nwork exemplifies a mixed-initiative approach in which users benefit from the\nautomation of UI agents while being able to express their preferences.",

        "summary": "Accurate delineation of pancreatic tumors is critical for diagnosis,\ntreatment planning, and outcome assessment, yet automated segmentation remains\nchallenging due to anatomical variability and limited dataset availability. In\nthis study, SegResNet models, as part of the Auto3DSeg architecture, were\ntrained and evaluated on two MRI-based pancreatic tumor segmentation tasks as\npart of the 2025 PANTHER Challenge. Algorithm methodology included 5-fold\ncross-validation with STAPLE ensembling after focusing on an anatomically\nrelevant region-of-interest. The Pancreatic Tumor Segmentation on Diagnostic\nMRI task 1 training set included 91 T1-weighted arterial contrast-enhanced MRI\nwith expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. The Pancreatic Tumor\nSegmentation on MR-Linac task 2 training set used 50 T2-weighted MR-Linac cases\nwith expert annotated pancreas and tumor labels. Algorithm-automated\nsegmentation performance of pancreatic tumor was assessed using Dice Similarity\nCoefficient (DSC), 5 mm DSC, 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance (HD95), Mean\nAverage Surface Distance (MASD), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). For Task 1,\nthe algorithm achieved a DSC of 0.56, 5 mm DSC of 0.73, HD95 of 41.1 mm, MASD\nof 26.0 mm, and RMSE of 5164 mm. For Task 2, performance decreased, with a DSC\nof 0.33, 5 mm DSC of 0.50, HD95 of 20.1 mm, MASD of 7.2 mm, and RMSE of 17,203\nmm. These findings illustrate the challenges of MRI-based pancreatic tumor\nsegmentation with small datasets, highlighting variability introduced by\ndifferent MRI sequences.
