        "summary": "Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation\nwithin a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on\nimage-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss\nfine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a\nsimple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a\nresource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding\nencoder embeddings as dense \"text prompts,\" providing rich supervision without\ncaptions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding\nembeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a\nself-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and\ngeneration. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across\nautoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it\nconsistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,\npost-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on\nGenEval (0.73$\\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\\rightarrow$88.15), while\nalso boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit\n6.94$\\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models\nand applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an\nefficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs",

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks\nlike image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to\nhallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior\nwork links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing\nattention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments\nacross layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we\nfirst show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,\nwe introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags\nanomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads\nwithin those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF\nreliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we\npropose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a\ntask-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects\nerrors during inference with negligible overhead.

        "summary": "Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due\nto its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing\napproaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability\ndistribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their\nability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different\nsemantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted\nMulti-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework\nutilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of\nmultiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution\nestimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts\nimage features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different\nregions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique\nstatistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture\nlikelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves\nstate-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and\ndecoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports\nRegions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/chunbaobao/SEEC.",

        "summary": "Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but\nremains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual\ncues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning\nframework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely\non target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in\ncomplex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and\nbackground discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video\nbackgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable\npriors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and\nsparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the\nbackground, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on\nthese insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires\nminimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a\ntokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank\npriors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local\nand non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying\non explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse\ncomponent update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to\nenhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared\nsmall target detection and space object detection.

        "summary": "Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are\nrobust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection\nperformance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier\nWatermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian\nsymmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that\nreduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by\nensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these\ntechniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their\nfrequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art\nverification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches\nacross various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on\ndetection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against\ncropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,\nour method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior\nimage fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed\nSFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image\nfidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking.

        "summary": "Modeling of high-frequency outgoing radiance distributions has long been a\nkey challenge in rendering, particularly for glossy material. Such\ndistributions concentrate radiative energy within a narrow lobe and are highly\nsensitive to changes in view direction. However, existing neural radiosity\nmethods, which primarily rely on positional feature encoding, exhibit notable\nlimitations in capturing these high-frequency, strongly view-dependent radiance\ndistributions. To address this, we propose a highly-efficient approach by\nreflectance-aware ray cone encoding based on the neural radiosity framework,\nnamed neural cone radiosity. The core idea is to employ a pre-filtered\nmulti-resolution hash grid to accurately approximate the glossy BSDF lobe,\nembedding view-dependent reflectance characteristics directly into the encoding\nprocess through continuous spatial aggregation. Our design not only\nsignificantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection\ndistributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of\nglossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our\nmethod reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,\nallowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently\nproduces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various\nglossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to\nbaseline approaches.",

        "summary": "Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference\nimage is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world\ninstances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are\nrarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain\ngaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We\npropose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key\ncomponents. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and\npose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare\nrefinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy\ndiversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with\nsynthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D\ngeneration to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging\nbenchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further\ndemonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the\npracticality of our method in real-world manipulation.

However, existing\nopen-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow\nonly a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for\ndifficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we\naddress this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce\nMini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of\nsteps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search\ntasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key\ncomponents. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of\nthousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory\nreasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain\ncold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including\ndepth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an\nover-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses\n(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,\nthereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite\ntraining with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates\ntrajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with\naccuracy improving as the number of turns increases.

        "summary": "3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a\nprevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong\ngeneralization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation\nmisalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds\nconvey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits\nboth input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy\npre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar\ndistractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features\nwithout explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To\naddress these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general\nframework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point\nclouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or\n3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative\nRepresentation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target\nsemantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.\nThis mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances\nresilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within\nLLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation\nDecoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying\nLLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving\ncomprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments\nshow that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and\n+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains\nacross 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness\nof comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.",

Our multi-view neural network is trained\nin a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution\n(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,\nenabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our\nmethod on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate\ncomparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling\nscales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online\nphase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for\npatient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.\nCode is available at https://github.com/MajaSchle/tripleSR.",

        "title": "HairGS: Hair Strand Reconstruction based on 3D Gaussian Splatting",
        "summary": "Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with\ngrowing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human\nmodeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient\nand explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of\nhair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level\nhair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline\nfirst reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian\nrasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands\nthrough a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under\nphotometric supervision.\n  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the\ngeometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair\nstrands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a\nproxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive\nexperiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient\nreconstruction, typically completing within one hour.\n  The project page can be found at: https://yimin-pan.github.io/hair-gs/",

        "summary": "Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual\nmortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and\n25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high\n(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address\nthis issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage\nin order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D\nintracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age\nand the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and\nmultimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection\n(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a\nsubsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse\npatients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:\n0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal\nXSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to\nmodality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the\nmultimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,\ndeeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both\nheart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of\nrelapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we\nstrive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.",

However, most existing methods rely heavily on large\nvolumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack\ninterpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel\nself-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity\nin longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned\nrepresentations into two components: a static representation, constrained by\ncontrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic\nrepresentation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects\ntemporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream\nclassification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease\nNeuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves\nsuperior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,\nthe learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open\nAccess Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization\non the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset.

        "summary": "Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in\ntasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still\nface several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and\nlack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing\nmodels are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D\nimage-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their\neffectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of\nstructural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient\nfine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate\nits application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces\ntwo key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic\nreports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we\nadd an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination\n(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that\ncorrelates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for\nfine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text\nmodalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD\ndatasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned\non 10,000 images.

However, as these benchmarks often contain\nspurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects\nand backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do\nspurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we\nsystematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks\n(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact\non bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such\nas masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically\nalter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in\nCLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model\nresponses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their\nreliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally\nchallenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity\nmeasurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.",

However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and\nincur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions\nthat differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,\nwe propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control\nadapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few\nimage-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages\nthe analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific\ncontrol features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small\nset of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks\nshow that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,\nachieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,\nwhen fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive\nperformance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks.

        "summary": "Hand gesture understanding is essential for several applications in\nhuman-computer interaction, including automatic clinical assessment of hand\ndexterity. While deep learning has advanced static gesture recognition, dynamic\ngesture understanding remains challenging due to complex spatiotemporal\nvariations. Moreover, existing datasets often lack multimodal and multi-view\ndiversity, precise ground-truth tracking, and an action quality component\nembedded within gestures. This paper introduces EHWGesture, a multimodal video\ndataset for gesture understanding featuring five clinically relevant gestures.\nIt includes over 1,100 recordings (6 hours), captured from 25 healthy subjects\nusing two high-resolution RGB-Depth cameras and an event camera. A motion\ncapture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all\ndevices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal\nalignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture\nunderstanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed\nthat mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments\nhighlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger\ndetection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a\ncomprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture\nunderstanding.",

        "summary": "Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,\nmotivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on\nmore accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes\nintroduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to\nmultiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single\nviewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,\na novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data\nto address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point\nclouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as\npossible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher\nnetwork learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally\naggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality\npseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for\nboth static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view\n2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all\navailable 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets\ndemonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly\nsupervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully\nsupervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \\footnote{Code\navailable upon acceptance} Our code is available in our public repository\n(\\href{https://github.com/CEA-LIST/MVAT}{code}).",

        "summary": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing\nsignificant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing\napplications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model\nvulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.\nAlthough current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the\ntransferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or\ndirectly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic\nfeatures and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,\ntheir reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to\ngradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example\nquality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and\npropose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we\npresent a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent\ninputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,\nwhich stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to\npreserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from\ntargeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing\nproblem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied\nto suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive\nexperiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance\nover 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with\nResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average\nimprovement in black-box attack success rate.",

While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate\nand complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured\nnature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.\nIn this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance\nField (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong\nand interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable\nSDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and\nimproves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,\nwe design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes\nGaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.\nExtensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and\nTanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction\naccuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.",

        "summary": "Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,\nleading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as\nmedicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically\nrequires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances\nin machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model\ncorrection. In this work, we investigate \\textit{Bias-Aware Machine\nUnlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature\nrepresentations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on\nprivacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies\nincluding Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through\nempirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),\nCIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),\nwe demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup\ndisparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \\textbf{94.86\\%}\non CUB-200, \\textbf{30.28\\%} on CIFAR-10, and \\textbf{97.37\\%} on CelebA. These\ngains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an\naverage of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,\nfairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a\npractical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without\nnecessitating full retraining.",

        "summary": "Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face\nprojections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal\nvasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal\ndiseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to\nmotion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications\nfor conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for\nOCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal\nlayers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details\nnecessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose\nXOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional\nSupervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for\nlayer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise\nen-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as\nsupervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for\neach retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF\nmodule enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction\ncombined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular\ndetails at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset\ndemonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which\nare significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring\nits potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value\nfor ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring.

        "summary": "The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically\nbased rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation\npipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry\nmodeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture\nsynthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end\nPBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter\n(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR\nmaterials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel\nperspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.\nSpecifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV\ndiffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,\nenabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple\ndiffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns\nmultiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed\nvariational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D\nGaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated\npost-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh\nassets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nexperiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and\nimage-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables\nflexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the\nknowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely\n69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used\nwill be publicly available via our project page:\nhttps://zx-yin.github.io/dreamlifting/.",

To address these limitations,\nmotivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector\nwith dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is\nproposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain\nEnhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba\n(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba\nscanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of\nimages, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency\nspectra features for recovering the texture-details.

Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly\nlocalized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce\ncoarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms\nrecover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,\ndual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically\ngrounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes\nwhole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local\nU-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that\ndescribe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)\nterms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring\nno manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using\nfive-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over\nUnion (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess\nthe roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.\nResults: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice\nof 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions\nshow the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious\nactivations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global\ncontext, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation.

        "summary": "This retrospective-prospective study evaluated whether a deep learning-based\nMRI reconstruction algorithm can preserve diagnostic quality in brain MRI scans\naccelerated up to fourfold, using both public and prospective clinical data.\nThe study included 18 healthy volunteers (scans acquired at 3T, January\n2024-March 2025), as well as selected fastMRI public datasets with diverse\npathologies. Phase-encoding-undersampled 2D/3D T1, T2, and FLAIR sequences were\nreconstructed with DeepFoqus-Accelerate and compared with standard-of-care\n(SOC). Three board-certified neuroradiologists and two MRI technologists\nindependently reviewed 36 paired SOC/AI reconstructions from both datasets\nusing a 5-point Likert scale, while quantitative similarity was assessed for\n408 scans and 1224 datasets using Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Haar wavelet-based Perceptual Similarity\nIndex (HaarPSI). No AI-reconstructed scan scored below 3 (minimally\nacceptable), and 95% scored $\\geq 4$. Mean SSIM was 0.95 $\\pm$ 0.03 (90% cases\n>0.90), PSNR >41.0 dB, and HaarPSI >0.94. Inter-rater agreement was slight to\nmoderate. Rare artifacts did not affect diagnostic interpretation. These\nfindings demonstrate that DeepFoqus-Accelerate enables robust fourfold brain\nMRI acceleration with 75% reduced scan time, while preserving diagnostic image\nquality and supporting improved workflow efficiency.",

Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,\nso-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised\napproaches.\n  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully\nunsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a\nparticular dataset.

We use both\ntraditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to\nevaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive\nanalysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on\ntheir impact on Na\\\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.\nFurthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether\nexposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.\nExperiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2\ndatasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce\ndetection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\\%.

Recent transformer-based models like VGGT\nand $\\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet\nthey face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of\nthe global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.\nIn this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these\nmodels and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of\npatch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.\nMotivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in\nlarge language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention\noperation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to\n$4\\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance.

However, this correlation\ncontains the hard pixel noise, \\textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,\nthat is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the\nbackground. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the\nbiological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level\ninformation. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in\nthe entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we\ndesign an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the\nobject-level correlation between the support target object and query general\nobjects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)\nand Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the\nquery general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity\ncues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and\nthe target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level\ncorrelation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object\nfeature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target\nfeature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction.

We propose a\nframework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this\nusing a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our\nDPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and\na ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained\nResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived\nfrom U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused\nfeatures achieves 98.0\\% accuracy and 98.1\\% sensitivity.

        "summary": "As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the\nbenchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on\nconsumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,\nthese metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This\npaper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX\n4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by\nsystem-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To\novercome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive\nInference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no\narchitectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference\nstrategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit\nand resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs\nwithin a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution\npass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection\nconfidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x\nspeedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.\nThis work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying\nhigh-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus\nfrom pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that\nmaximize throughput.",

Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class\nneighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto\nthese neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant\nof neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly\ncontributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments\nacross standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that\nour method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading\nadversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both\nrobust and clean accuracy.

We also introduce an\nAdaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion\naggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into\nsparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we\npropose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages\nglobal-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further\nenhancing efficiency and accuracy.

Recurrent controllers\nstruggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion\nincurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.\nWe present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a\nselective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable\nboth recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and\nnear-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations\n(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked\nSSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range\ndependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic\nself-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable\ntraining under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula\nthat randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene\ncomplexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy\nefficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach\nconsistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety\n(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the\nsame compute budget.

        "summary": "Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is essential for diagnosing conditions\nsuch as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.\nAccurate retinal layer segmentation enables quantitative biomarkers critical\nfor clinical decision-making, but manual segmentation is time-consuming and\nvariable, while conventional deep learning models often lack interpretability.\nThis work proposes an improved SegNet-based deep learning framework for\nautomated and interpretable retinal layer segmentation. Architectural\ninnovations, including modified pooling strategies, enhance feature extraction\nfrom noisy OCT images, while a hybrid loss function combining categorical\ncross-entropy and Dice loss improves performance for thin and imbalanced\nretinal layers. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) is\nintegrated to provide visual explanations, allowing clinical validation of\nmodel decisions. Trained and validated on the Duke OCT dataset, the framework\nachieved 95.77% validation accuracy, a Dice coefficient of 0.9446, and a\nJaccard Index (IoU) of 0.8951. Class-wise results confirmed robust performance\nacross most layers, with challenges remaining for thinner boundaries. Grad-CAM\nvisualizations highlighted anatomically relevant regions, aligning segmentation\nwith clinical biomarkers and improving transparency. By combining architectural\nimprovements, a customized hybrid loss, and explainable AI, this study delivers\na high-performing SegNet-based framework that bridges the gap between accuracy\nand interpretability. The approach offers strong potential for standardizing\nOCT analysis, enhancing diagnostic efficiency, and fostering clinical trust in\nAI-driven ophthalmic tools.",

        "summary": "Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences\nbetween images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical\nlocation. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a\nsingle view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks\ninterpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without\nexplaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a\nfoundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including\nUAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning\nthem exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training\nefficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable\nto prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.\nMoreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,\nwe leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view\ncorrespondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we\nconstruct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro\nto generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through\ndetailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable\ncross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in\ngeo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL\npipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable\ncorrespondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable\nreasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain\nAnd Match.

        "summary": "The widespread use of generative AI has shown remarkable success in producing\nhighly realistic deepfakes, posing a serious threat to various voice biometric\napplications, including speaker verification, voice biometrics, audio\nconferencing, and criminal investigations. To counteract this, several\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) audio deepfake detection (ADD) methods have been\nproposed to identify generative AI signatures to distinguish between real and\ndeepfake audio. However, the effectiveness of these methods is severely\nundermined by anti-forensic (AF) attacks that conceal generative signatures.\nThese AF attacks span a wide range of techniques, including statistical\nmodifications (e.g., pitch shifting, filtering, noise addition, and\nquantization) and optimization-based attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD, C \\& W, and\nDeepFool). In this paper, we investigate the SoTA ADD methods and provide a\ncomparative analysis to highlight their effectiveness in exposing deepfake\nsignatures, as well as their vulnerabilities under adversarial conditions. We\nconducted an extensive evaluation of ADD methods on five deepfake benchmark\ndatasets using two categories: raw and spectrogram-based approaches. This\ncomparative analysis enables a deeper understanding of the strengths and\nlimitations of SoTA ADD methods against diverse AF attacks. It does not only\nhighlight vulnerabilities of ADD methods, but also informs the design of more\nrobust and generalized detectors for real-world voice biometrics. It will\nfurther guide future research in developing adaptive defense strategies that\ncan effectively counter evolving AF techniques.",

        "summary": "Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks\nin fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of\nthese models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and\naccountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this\npaper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to\naddress this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT\nimages, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention\nconvolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention\nrollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean\ncurvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in\ncombination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed\nedges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also\nyielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based\nexplanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose\noptimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and\ndistance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase\nwith 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.\nThe CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps\ncan enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While\ndemonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based\nclassification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent\nand competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.",
