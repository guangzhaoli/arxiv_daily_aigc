        "summary": "Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying\ninputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to\ninterpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use\ncounterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and\ngenerative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful\nattributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious\ncorrelations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.\n  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution\n(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions\nrely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept\nDependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like\nbackgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that\nperturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum\nlearning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy\nwhile avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.\n  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides\na scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying\nidentity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age\naffect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal\ngraphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,\ntraining-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal\nsensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.\n  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for\ninterpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative\nmodels, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias\nevaluation and mitigation.",

        "summary": "3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using\nnatural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher\naccuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for\nreal-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.\nHowever, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited\nreasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions\nor detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel\nzero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with\nspatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first\ngenerates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and\nrefines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant\ncandidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects\nthese candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial\nrelationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point\ncloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we\nimplement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes\nsequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to\nidentify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D\nbenchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores\nof 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,\nrespectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world\napplicability.

        "summary": "Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained\nmodels in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,\nthis paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it\navailable on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.\nFortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense\npriors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the\ngeneralization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,\nvideos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial\nconsistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic\ninformation contained within the videos enables the generated content to be\nmore faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper\nexplores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning\ndatasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video\ndataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative\nmodel supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to\nproduce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in\ncontrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential\nfor extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense\npriors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation.

        "summary": "Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose\nsignificant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the\nmanipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the\nmain barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe\nlack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we\nintroduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily\navailable web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images\nfrom the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a\nsimpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.\nSpecifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and\naccurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve\nannotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out\nunreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a\nlarge-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually\nforged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than\nexisting handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object\nJitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating\nhigh-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a\nnew model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for\nthe image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and\nsignificantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world\nforgery benchmarks.

To address these\nchallenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on\nframework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a\nSemi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with\nclass embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference\nfeature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.\nThis allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused\nacross all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and\nachieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to\nfacilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce\nDressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset.

        "summary": "Metastasis remains the major challenge in the clinical management of head and\nneck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Reliable pre-treatment prediction of\nmetastatic risk is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies and prognosis.\nThis study develops a deep learning-based multimodal framework to predict\nmetastasis risk in HNSCC patients by integrating computed tomography (CT)\nimages, radiomics, and clinical data. 1497 HNSCC patients were included. Tumor\nand organ masks were derived from pretreatment CT images. A 3D Swin Transformer\nextracted deep features from tumor regions. Meanwhile, 1562 radiomics features\nwere obtained using PyRadiomics, followed by correlation filtering and random\nforest selection, leaving 36 features. Clinical variables including age, sex,\nsmoking, and alcohol status were encoded and fused with imaging-derived\nfeatures. Multimodal features were fed into a fully connected network to\npredict metastasis risk. Performance was evaluated using five-fold\ncross-validation with area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity\n(SEN), and specificity (SPE). The proposed fusion model outperformed\nsingle-modality models. The 3D deep learning module alone achieved an AUC of\n0.715, and when combined with radiomics and clinical features, predictive\nperformance improved (AUC = 0.803, ACC = 0.752, SEN = 0.730, SPE = 0.758).\nStratified analysis showed generalizability across tumor subtypes. Ablation\nstudies indicated complementary information from different modalities.\nEvaluation showed the 3D Swin Transformer provided more robust representation\nlearning than conventional networks. This multimodal fusion model demonstrated\nhigh accuracy and robustness in predicting metastasis risk in HNSCC, offering a\ncomprehensive representation of tumor biology. The interpretable model has\npotential as a clinical decision-support tool for personalized treatment\nplanning.",

However, it is unclear whether existing\nwatermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning\nsolution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which\nstress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.\nThe challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,\ndepending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by\nthe provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based\nevasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in\nCIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first\ncluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.\nThen, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection\nand semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with\noptimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method\nsuccessfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible\nimpact on the residual image's quality.

Although\nthese domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ\nsignificantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics.

However, scaling diffusion transformers to generate long-context\nvideos is fundamentally limited by the quadratic cost of self-attention, which\nmakes memory and computation intractable and difficult to optimize for long\nsequences. We recast long-context video generation as an internal information\nretrieval task and propose a simple, learnable sparse attention routing module,\nMixture of Contexts (MoC), as an effective long-term memory retrieval engine.\nIn MoC, each query dynamically selects a few informative chunks plus mandatory\nanchors (caption, local windows) to attend to, with causal routing that\nprevents loop closures. As we scale the data and gradually sparsify the\nrouting, the model allocates compute to salient history, preserving identities,\nactions, and scenes over minutes of content. Efficiency follows as a byproduct\nof retrieval (near-linear scaling), which enables practical training and\nsynthesis, and the emergence of memory and consistency at the scale of minutes.",

Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by\nvisual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics\nand temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding\nas a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel\ntraining-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by\nMaximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,\nwe first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then\ndynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal\ngain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm\nthat jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby\nmaximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid\ncan maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly\nimproving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original\nperformance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the\nprefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B.

        "summary": "Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of\nrecognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.\nHandwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data\nto augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.\nFirst, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which\nstruggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,\nthey largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is\nessential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in\nhandwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot\nhandwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent\ntext from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to\nbetter capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We\nfurther introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages\nhigh-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated\nsamples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that\naligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby\nenhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting\ndatasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent\nhandwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource\nhandwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines.

        "summary": "The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in\nsampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.\nExisting video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer\nfrom fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of\nvideo frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.\nTo bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a\ndistillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video\ndiffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single\nstep. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video\nmodels:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial\ndistillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator\nfrom high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of\nsingle-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified\nadversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism\nthat promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash\nequilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step\nvideos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)\nconditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic\nconsistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated\nframes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other\nacceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,\ntemporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained\nmodel by 100$\\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining\ncompetitive performance.",

Moreover, although RGB-T crowd\ncounting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have\nintegrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these\nchallenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework\nthat integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a\ndirect quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,\nmaking it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both\ninput images and population density information in a mutually beneficial\nmulti-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,\nwe introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we\nincorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and\ncrowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial\nattacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that\nFusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves\nsuperior crowd counting performance.",

        "title": "Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models",
        "summary": "A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel\nmeanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.\nVision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,\nhowever, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of\ncomposition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a\nVLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or\na blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails\nto capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained\nsignificant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot\nclassifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively\nwith CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the\ngenerative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation\nabilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --\nDiffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with\nattributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised\nzero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion\nClassifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models\nstruggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader\nchallenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings\nsuggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of\nrelational concepts such as left and right.

To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference\nreward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score\nmaximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In\nPref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,\nand the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,\nproviding more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,\nexisting T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering\ncomprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a\nunified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20\nsubthemes.

First, to\nachieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route\nAutoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational\ncomplexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.\nSecond, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the\nbitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time.

Given an\ninput image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first\napplies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion\ntransformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent\nself-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity\nembeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided\nprompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.\nWe formally justify and empirically validate the \"style-first, identity-after\"\nparadigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.\nQuantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and\nstate-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative\nanalyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's\nreal-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of\nidentity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for\nblending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the\nreconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by\nrepresenting an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing\nmethods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly\nconstructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and\nreduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of\nreconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a\nnovel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and\nconsistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head\nregions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the\nSubject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy\n(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize\nidentity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal\ninputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric\nalignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the\nlater employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,\neffectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive\nexperiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,\nphotometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack\nsignificantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving\nfrontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent\nvisual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.",

        "summary": "Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to\nalleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging\ninformation from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA\nhave been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder\nto work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets\ncan lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the\nbenefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557\nsimulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image\nclassification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various\nscenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited\ntraining samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful\nobservations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these\ntechniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the\nDeep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved\nfeasible classification accuracy (91.2\\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using\nResnet50 and showed an important accuracy improvement in the dynamic data\nstream DA scenario (+6.7\\%) compared to the baseline. Our results also\ndemonstrate that DSAN exhibits remarkable level of explainability when\nevaluated on COVID-19 and skin cancer datasets.

        "summary": "Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is\ncritical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and\nglioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising\nresults in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for\nlabeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation\ncosts by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting\nhigh-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous\nactive domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by\nselecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such\none-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source\nmedical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal\nmedical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and\nsequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection\nin ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the\nmost valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.\nEmpirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks\ndemonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,\nsignificantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods.

Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce\nreconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from\nlimited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a\ndescriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core\nidea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based\ntext-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained\nText-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.\nSpecifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a\nCross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference\nimage features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its\ntext-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction\ndataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other\nextensions, and is more scalable.

While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable\nsuccess, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its\nricher geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of\npowerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To\nbridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an\nensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.\nHowever, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:\nexisting strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus\ndegrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel\nImportance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution\nof each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise\ncritical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling\nit to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve\ntheir unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly\ndetection.

        "summary": "Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal\ndependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often\nrely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face\nissues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of\nend-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced\nmulti-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment\nselection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning\npipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs\nreasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on\nthe evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current\nquestion. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually\naware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we\nintroduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level\nrewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing\nframe-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and\nquestion comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing\nend-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,\nand EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both\naccuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video\nunderstanding.",

        "summary": "Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and\nassessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum\ndysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the\nrarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of\ndeep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain\nrandomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a\nsynthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations\nfrom healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without\nrequiring pathological annotations.\n  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with\nCCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on\nCCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with\nother pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically\nrelevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show\ntheir utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed\naugmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in\nhealthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these\nquantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological\nconsistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable\nshape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating\ndomain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively\nmitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant\nmalformations.",

Although\nstate-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their\nheavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical\napplications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware\nMulti-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture\nfor real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware\nmodule that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through\na gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A\ntoken-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature\ninteraction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key\nsemantic cues during downsampling.

        "summary": "In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods\nare prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of\nsingle-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic\nuncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network\n(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is\ndesigned to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph\nconstructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel\nadaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small\nstructures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion\nstrategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to\nweightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can\ndynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different\nscenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and\nstrengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between\ncross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions\nunder occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the\ndetection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through\nmulti-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and\nuncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that\nDUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,\nespecially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds.

        "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by\nminimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic\nhardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.\nCurrent ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in\nclassification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual\ndetection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike\napproach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by\nheterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel\ntemporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This\nenables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their\naccumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.\nOur method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than\nrelying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron\nmaintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate\nthat our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower\ntime-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection\ntasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across\ntwo critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN\nconversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low\nlatency (within 5 time-steps).",

We\npropose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear\nsynthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of\nvectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the\nmulti-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative\ncombination of atoms associated to a label.

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance\nacross a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing\ndynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework\nto systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across\nlayers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories\n(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a\nstandardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different\nlayers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt\nvariations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level\nchanges, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by\nmodifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that\npreserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to\nLLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent\nstage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle\nlayers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers\nprepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall\nstage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,\ninstruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation\nto each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our\nfindings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs\nand offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal\nrepresentation dynamics.",

The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming\nbandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution\nto 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect\naccurate depth from some materials.

This study\nextends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,\naddressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of\nspatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a\nspatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's\nperspective in spherical scenes.

Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual\ncues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this\naim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a\nvision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical\ngeometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which\nfurther incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our\nresults on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,\ndemonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing\nmethods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these\nresults, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model\narchitecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional\nvideos. Code and dataset will be available at\nhttps://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.",

        "summary": "Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its\npractical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating\nhigh-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural\nhand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames\nbut suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,\nand scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,\nresulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this\nwork, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates\naudio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into\nhigh-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose\nsequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our\npose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual\nanchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance\nsemantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward\nmechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD\nand HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance\nin video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation\nstudies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made\npublic.",

        "summary": "Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in\ndiagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist\nclinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model\npredictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.\nTo this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a\npotential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for\ndiagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a\nnumber of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,\nlesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high\naccuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the\npotential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM\nembedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to\npredict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the\nembedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval\ncase study using the SLICE-3D dataset.",

        "summary": "Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable\nDiffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing\nsignificant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery\nlocalization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly\nannotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image\nmanipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to\nintegrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into\nan image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery\nlocalization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of\nSD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to\ninherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this\nfoundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable\nDiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the\nmulti-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating\nimage forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific\nhighpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the\nlatent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.\nNotably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,\nthereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.\nExperimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in\nperformance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current\nstate-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model\ndemonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document\nforgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were\nentirely unseen during training.",

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to\naddress a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite\nshowcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue\nis the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the\nuser's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer\nthe MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In\ncontrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build\nsynthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary\nmodels, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to\ngauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of\ngenerated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options\n(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf\nMLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we\nrefer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated\nanswers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of\nfine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward.

        "summary": "Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role\nin preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often\nyield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion\nmorphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow\nwhere dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed\ntooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training\nnetwork for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing\nautomated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view\nfrom panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then\npretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The\nglobal-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating\nregion proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts\ndetailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the\nregion proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we\nintroduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically\nfuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the\nfused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To\nrigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further\nvalidate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries\ndetection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays\nfor double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior\nperformance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,\nindicating the clinical applicability of our method.

Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as\nnon-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where\nlabeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We\npropose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic\nultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that\nenhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)\nclassification.

        "summary": "Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated\nlabels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining\nhigh-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this\nissue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB\nimages as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these\nmethods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB\nimages. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to\nthe quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms\nof LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a\nnovel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at\nan early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance\nsegmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional\nfusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,\nwhile 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To\nmitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and\nglobal filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth\nestimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove\nsegmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion\nbased dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes\nunder a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.\nExtensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector\ntrained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous\nstate-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation\nbenchmark.",

Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve\ncomparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational\nefficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection\nstrategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a\nlarge pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is\napplied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial\nweight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,\nfollowed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining\ndual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method\novercomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to\nretain critical information in compact models.

        "summary": "Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form\nof a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end\ntrainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often\nstruggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views\nor with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not\nexploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect\npedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called\nMulti-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV\nfeatures by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual\nviews into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits\nthe properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.\nTherefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with\nconsistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information\nat different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV\nfeatures using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of\npedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV\nfeatures greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the\nprevious highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.",

Federated\nLearning (FL), a privacy-preserving distributed training framework, offers a\nnew solution by enabling collaborative model development across fragmented\nmedical datasets. In this survey, we review FL's contributions at two stages of\nthe full-stack medical analysis pipeline. First, in upstream tasks such as CT\nor MRI reconstruction, FL enables joint training of robust reconstruction\nnetworks on diverse, multi-institutional datasets, alleviating data scarcity\nwhile preserving confidentiality. Second, in downstream clinical tasks like\ntumor diagnosis and segmentation, FL supports continuous model updating by\nallowing local fine-tuning on new data without centralizing sensitive images.\nWe comprehensively analyze FL implementations across the medical imaging\npipeline, from physics-informed reconstruction networks to diagnostic AI\nsystems, highlighting innovations that improve communication efficiency, align\nheterogeneous data, and ensure secure parameter aggregation.

        "title": "GUARD: Guideline Upholding Test through Adaptive Role-play and Jailbreak Diagnostics for LLMs",
        "summary": "As Large Language Models become increasingly integral to various domains,\ntheir potential to generate harmful responses has prompted significant societal\nand regulatory concerns. In response, governments have issued ethics guidelines\nto promote the development of trustworthy AI. However, these guidelines are\ntypically high-level demands for developers and testers, leaving a gap in\ntranslating them into actionable testing questions to verify LLM compliance.\n  To address this challenge, we introduce GUARD (\\textbf{G}uideline\n\\textbf{U}pholding Test through \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{R}ole-play and\nJailbreak \\textbf{D}iagnostics), a testing method designed to operationalize\nguidelines into specific guideline-violating questions that assess LLM\nadherence. To implement this, GUARD uses automated generation of\nguideline-violating questions based on government-issued guidelines, thereby\ntesting whether responses comply with these guidelines. When responses directly\nviolate guidelines, GUARD reports inconsistencies. Furthermore, for responses\nthat do not directly violate guidelines, GUARD integrates the concept of\n``jailbreaks'' to diagnostics, named GUARD-JD, which creates scenarios that\nprovoke unethical or guideline-violating responses, effectively identifying\npotential scenarios that could bypass built-in safety mechanisms. Our method\nfinally culminates in a compliance report, delineating the extent of adherence\nand highlighting any violations.\n  We have empirically validated the effectiveness of GUARD on seven LLMs,\nincluding Vicuna-13B, LongChat-7B, Llama2-7B, Llama-3-8B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4,\nGPT-4o, and Claude-3.7, by testing compliance under three government-issued\nguidelines and conducting jailbreak diagnostics. Additionally, GUARD-JD can\ntransfer jailbreak diagnostics to vision-language models, demonstrating its\nusage in promoting reliable LLM-based applications.",

        "summary": "CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with\nopen-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance\nspatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence\nisn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations\nsuch as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct\ninteraction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the\nfull potential of CLIP.\n  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive\nframework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the\nintermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the\nmodel's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual\nsemantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between\ninternal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's\noutputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including\nattention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and\nadaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our\nmethod functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four\nstate-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H).

        "title": "ChainReaction! Structured Approach with Causal Chains as Intermediate Representations for Improved and Explainable Causal Video Question Answering",
        "summary": "Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle\nwith higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that\nentangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These\nblack-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on\nshallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly\ndecouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language\ncausal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human\ncognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level\nvideo content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and\nlogically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal\nChain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,\nand a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in\nthese chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a\nscalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing\ndatasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation\nmetric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and\ngeneralization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine\nacross diverse domains.

To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a\nrecurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided\ndeformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a\nrecurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over\nthe cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and\nmotion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation\nguides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering\nsegmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity\nloss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The\nBayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the\nestimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing\nwarped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates\nsuperior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields\nlower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region\ncompared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,\nindicating higher confidence in its predictions.",

This study introduces a\nnovel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert\ncharacterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language\nrepresentations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with\npre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual\nmicrostructural data and textual expert assessments into shared\nrepresentations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we\ndevelop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both\npositive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their\nassociated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of\npreviously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.\nValidation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset\ndemonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and\ndefective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative\nanalysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the\nCLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score\nnormalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on\ntheir local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and\nclassification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method\nenhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by\nenabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model\nretraining.

Although machine learning algorithms could be exploited for aiding\nphysicians in accurately performing such a task, these algorithms suffer from\nsignificative performance drop when evaluated on images coming from domains\nthat are different from the training ones. In this work, we propose a\nMamba-based approach for mitosis detection under domain shift, inspired by the\npromising performance demonstrated by Mamba in medical imaging segmentation\ntasks. Specifically, our approach exploits a VM-UNet architecture for carrying\nout the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further\nimproving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been\nsubmitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)\nchallenge.

In this work, we analyze how CLIP\nvision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized\nattention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract\nand transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these\ninsights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic\nattacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention\nheads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to\n19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard\nImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach\nremains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that\nrely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models\nwhich are significantly more robust against typographic attacks.

To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have\nemerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.\nWhile prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low\nuncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual\nuncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class\npredictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To\nbridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA\nframework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.\nThrough a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure\nof the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling\nlabel-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty\nobjects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that\npreserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing\nuncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism\nforms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic\nclassification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial\nunderstanding.

        "summary": "LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet\nhigh-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.\nExisting methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or\nvoxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme\nsparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby\nlimiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we\npropose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our\nframework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry\nRe-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features\nat denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.\nThis module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while\nmaintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature\nPropagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to\nguide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information\nsharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and\nproviding enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By\nintegrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature\nrepresentation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the\ncoding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art\ncompression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both\nencoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization.

        "summary": "This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge\nDistillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable\nfor resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines\nadaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer\nknowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\\,M parameters) to\nlightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:\nCompact (1.3\\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\\,M\nparameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \\textit{Rosa\ndamascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,\nsoutheastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer\nvision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental\nevaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated\nsignificant improvements over direct training methods. All student models\nachieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\\% with ATMS-KD compared to\n95--96\\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established\nknowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\\% accuracy with the compact\nmodel -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach\nwhile maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\\,ms.

        "summary": "Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,\nspectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing\nsolutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training\npipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a\nunified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,\nself-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT\nencoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the\nreconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring\nthe encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,\ndiscriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label\nsupervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited\nlabels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and\nViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only\n15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR\nlevels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and\nlabel-efficient solution for AMR.",

        "summary": "Identifying sitters in historical paintings is a key task for art historians,\noffering insight into their lives and how they chose to be seen. However, the\nprocess is often subjective and limited by the lack of data and stylistic\nvariations. Automated facial recognition is capable of handling challenging\nconditions and can assist, but while traditional facial recognition models\nperform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift\nand high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,\nand influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we\ninvestigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in\nartworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings\nwith those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate\nnotable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show\nthat foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are\nineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/",

Without access\nto source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics\nof the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion\nand introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate\npseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels\ncannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To\naddress these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that\nintroduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.\nThis framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data\ninto semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers\nto learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between\nthe sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture\ndata features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the\nwhole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we\nset a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to\ncarry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the\nnoise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation.

However, manual segmentation of PVS is\ntime-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing\nautomated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to\ngeneralize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted\nMedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,\nfor automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a\nhomogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human\nConnectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous\nT1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners.

MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on\nthe T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of\n0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater\nreliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.\nThe same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a\nsubstantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM).

        "summary": "Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the\ngeneralizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen\ndomains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba\narchitectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high\ncomputational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an\nemerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive\nfields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work\nthat studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that\ndirectly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's\nfixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial\ndistortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local\ngeometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention\nin RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through\nexponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.\nTo this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored\nfor DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and\ncross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In\nparticular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local\nneighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,\nCross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate\nattention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.",

        "title": "Looking Beyond the Obvious: A Survey on Abstract Concept Recognition for Video Understanding",
        "summary": "The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered\nby deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable\nof understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be\nobjects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique\nability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts\nlike justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a\ncrucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple\nsemantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue\nthat the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to\naddress abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of\nhigh-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more\naligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different\ntasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We\nobserve that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted\nto solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their\ndisposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help\nus shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing\nthe wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation\nmodels.",

        "title": "Occlusion Robustness of CLIP for Military Vehicle Classification",
        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by\naligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for\ndefense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in\nchallenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP\nvariants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle\nclasses and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across\nocclusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP\nmodels consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions\ndegrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite\nimproved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around\n35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop\noccurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of\nocclusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further\nexploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for\nreal-world deployment of CLIP.",

On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble\nachieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it\nreduced sensitivity and overall performance.
