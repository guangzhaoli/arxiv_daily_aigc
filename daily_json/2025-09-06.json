        "summary": "Medical image synthesis has become an essential strategy for augmenting\ndatasets and improving model generalization in data-scarce clinical settings.\nHowever, fine-grained and controllable synthesis remains difficult due to\nlimited high-quality annotations and domain shifts across datasets. Existing\nmethods, often designed for natural images or well-defined tumors, struggle to\ngeneralize to chest radiographs, where disease patterns are morphologically\ndiverse and tightly intertwined with anatomical structures. To address these\nchallenges, we propose AURAD, a controllable radiology synthesis framework that\njointly generates high-fidelity chest X-rays and pseudo semantic masks. Unlike\nprior approaches that rely on randomly sampled masks-limiting diversity,\ncontrollability, and clinical relevance-our method learns to generate masks\nthat capture multi-pathology coexistence and anatomical-pathological\nconsistency. It follows a progressive pipeline: pseudo masks are first\ngenerated from clinical prompts conditioned on anatomical structures, and then\nused to guide image synthesis. We also leverage pretrained expert medical\nmodels to filter outputs and ensure clinical plausibility. Beyond visual\nrealism, the synthesized masks also serve as labels for downstream tasks such\nas detection and segmentation, bridging the gap between generative modeling and\nreal-world clinical applications. Extensive experiments and blinded radiologist\nevaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method\nacross tasks and datasets. In particular, 78% of our synthesized images are\nclassified as authentic by board-certified radiologists, and over 40% of\npredicted segmentation overlays are rated as clinically useful. All code,\npre-trained models, and the synthesized dataset will be released upon\npublication.",

        "summary": "Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models\nthat simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad\napplications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,\nentertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will\neffectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information\nabout the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has\nenabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged\nadvanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent\nadvances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on\nuser instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing\nLatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that\nstreamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld\nleverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering\nengine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed\nframework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal\ninputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,\nfeaturing competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics\nsimulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to\nevaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene\nlayout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a\n$90\\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high\ncreative quality compared with traditional manual production methods.

To address this issue, we introduce\nCOGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark\ndesigned to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual\ndomains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs\nrule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like\nenvironments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28\ninteroperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid\nparametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of\nmillions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several\norders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing\nvirtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments\nusing state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to\ngeneralize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain\nperformance.

We study symbolic graphics programming, where\nthe goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task\nalso serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting\nthem to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper\nsticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to\nwhich LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a\ncomprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and\ncompositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On\nSGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially\noutperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general\ncoding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to\ngenerate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards\napproach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a\ncross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision\nencoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to\nQwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and\nsemantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems.

        "summary": "Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)\nface challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted\ntarget data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full\naccess to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios\nwhere source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or\nbecause it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.\nMoreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.\nWe illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are\nunavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve\ncontinuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an\nefficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and\nunlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,\nCUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for\nclassification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based\nRegularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),\nsemi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase\nthe efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with\nelectroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural\nMRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in\nroot-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training\nexamples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and\noutperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation\nmodels by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two\nother real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient\napproach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is\nubiquitous in biology and medicine.",

        "summary": "Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision\ntask due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that\ninfluence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at\nfeature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,\npotentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at\ndifferent levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the\nScale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture\nthat synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational\nmodeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale\nmodule with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying\nreceptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a\nsequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their\ninteractions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We\nconduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark\ndataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It\nachieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our\nfindings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale\nvisual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT\narchitecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for\ncomplex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware\nunderstanding.",

To address\ntheir limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained\noptimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order\ngeometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian\nsplatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and\ndensification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian\nprimitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of\nthe object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain\ngeometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and\nnoise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our\nframework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view\nsynthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the\nperformance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically\ngrounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light\nsettings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to\ndate for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance\nsegmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable\nLearning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to\nenhance perception under adverse lighting.

        "summary": "Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and\ntemporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these\nmodels from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation\nmodels (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer\nand generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a\nlightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a\ntext-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the\nMultiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper\napproach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by\nfusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear\nmapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels\nbetween cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our\nMFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better\nperformance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,\nrequiring only 16\\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based\nwork, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger\nscale.",

        "summary": "The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed\ndue to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to\ngenerate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input\nviews, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we\npropose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images\nfrom a similar object to provide strong prior information during view\nsynthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system\nand employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting\nreference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play\nadapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically\ngenerate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to\npreserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple\nattention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch\nfeatures into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated\nthat our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in semantic segmentation of multi-modal remote sensing images\nhave significantly improved the accuracy of tree cover mapping, supporting\napplications in urban planning, forest monitoring, and ecological assessment.\nIntegrating data from multiple modalities-such as optical imagery, light\ndetection and ranging (LiDAR), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-has shown\nsuperior performance over single-modality methods. However, these data are\noften acquired days or even months apart, during which various changes may\noccur, such as vegetation disturbances (e.g., logging, and wildfires) and\nvariations in imaging quality. Such temporal misalignments introduce\ncross-modal uncertainty, especially in high-resolution imagery, which can\nseverely degrade segmentation accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose\nMURTreeFormer, a novel multi-modal segmentation framework that mitigates and\nleverages aleatoric uncertainty for robust tree cover mapping. MURTreeFormer\ntreats one modality as primary and others as auxiliary, explicitly modeling\npatch-level uncertainty in the auxiliary modalities via a probabilistic latent\nrepresentation. Uncertain patches are identified and reconstructed from the\nprimary modality's distribution through a VAE-based resampling mechanism,\nproducing enhanced auxiliary features for fusion. In the decoder, a gradient\nmagnitude attention (GMA) module and a lightweight refinement head (RH) are\nfurther integrated to guide attention toward tree-like structures and to\npreserve fine-grained spatial details. Extensive experiments on multi-modal\ndatasets from Shanghai and Zurich demonstrate that MURTreeFormer significantly\nimproves segmentation performance and effectively reduces the impact of\ntemporally induced aleatoric uncertainty.",

        "summary": "Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important\nfor enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in\nsafety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble\nmethods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,\na mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a\ngating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.\nBuilding on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous\nworks, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be\nextracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three\nmethods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual\ninformation, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two\nexperts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show\nthat MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of\nconditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.\nAdditionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and\nfind that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing\nuncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our\nexperiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of\nexperts can further enhance uncertainty calibration.

In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can\nhybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving\nhigh effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid\nmethod, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,\nwhich includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query\nfor each video.

However, existing diffusion parallelism\ninference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU\nenvironments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause\nworkload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion\nInference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in\nsuch settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained\nparallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI\nintroduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup\nphases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to\nreduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further\nminimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism\nmechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to\ntheir computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through\na complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both\nload-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy,\ndemonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance\nbottlenecks.

        "summary": "Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of\naccurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its\nrobustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle\nplatforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance\ndegradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another\nbecause of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset\ntraining and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed\nenvironmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in\ncontrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely\nunexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor\nconfigurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream\nFine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and\nPartial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve\ncross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the\nsame geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint\ntraining with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently\noutperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a\npractical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the\ndiverse vehicle platforms.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)\nhave challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in\ncomputer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba\noffer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture\nfine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess\nstrong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning\ncapabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce\n\\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs\nand multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a\nhierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract\nrich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later\nstages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently\nmodel long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for\nsuperior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with\nrespect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through\nextensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic\nsegmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,\nsurpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming\nVision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters.

        "summary": "Multimodal foundation models can process several modalities. However, since\nthe space of possible modalities is large and evolving over time, training a\nmodel from scratch to encompass all modalities is unfeasible. Moreover,\nintegrating a modality into a pre-existing foundation model currently requires\na significant amount of paired data, which is often not available for\nlow-resource modalities. In this paper, we introduce a method for\nsample-efficient modality integration (SEMI) into Large Language Models (LLMs).\nTo this end, we devise a hypernetwork that can adapt a shared projector --\nplaced between modality-specific encoders and an LLM -- to any modality. The\nhypernetwork, trained on high-resource modalities (i.e., text, speech, audio,\nvideo), is conditioned on a few samples from any arbitrary modality at\ninference time to generate a suitable adapter. To increase the diversity of\ntraining modalities, we artificially multiply the number of encoders through\nisometric transformations. We find that SEMI achieves a significant boost in\nsample efficiency during few-shot integration of new modalities (i.e.,\nsatellite images, astronomical images, inertial measurements, and molecules)\nwith encoders of arbitrary embedding dimensionality. For instance, to reach the\nsame accuracy as 32-shot SEMI, training the projector from scratch needs\n64$\\times$ more data. As a result, SEMI holds promise to extend the modality\ncoverage of foundation models.",

        "summary": "Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as\nsecurity monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their\nadvancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to\nadversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to\neither conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe\nconsequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and\npotential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,\ngeneralizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce\nDISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.\nUnlike previous works that aim to \"detect and remove\" adversarial patches,\nDISPATCH adopts a \"regenerate and rectify\" strategy, leveraging generative\nmodels to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input\nimage. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of\ndiffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.\nA rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial\nregions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic\nand requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments\nacross multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating\nattacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and\nlowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.\nMoreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a\npractical and reliable defense for object detection systems.",

        "summary": "Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify\nsigns in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods\nlike contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn\nmeaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of\nthe same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the\npositive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide\ninformation that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive\nmethods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all\nparts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of\ncertain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make\nnegative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues\nlead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor\nresults in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised\nlearning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This\nframework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new\nself-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation\ntechnique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to\nseveral contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,\nsemi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.",

However, the following challenges still exist in prior\nmethods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive\nmechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference\nspeed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable\nof parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and\nsupport for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose\nSparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization\nprecision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are\nsimultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based\ndiscrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a\npre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token\nrouter and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations\ninherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token\ngeneration process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the\ninference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on\na modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model\nto identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.\nMoreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to\nsystematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across\ndiverse scenarios.

        "summary": "High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables\nlabel-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing\ntheir refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during\nflow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume\nthat cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to\nbe known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to\nnear-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells\nwith complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population\ncan be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust\nstatistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction\nframework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural\nrepresentations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.\nBy jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric\nstructure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell\ngeometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows\naccurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted\nangular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or\nonly 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in\nsitu, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,\nproviding a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis\nin flow cytometry platforms.",

        "summary": "Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban\nmobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed\ncameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,\nlow adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance\nsystem capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and\nbehavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system\nleverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and\nhomography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from\naltitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates\nrobust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of\n90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.\nBeyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and\nautomatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane\nchanges, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion\nof geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The\nintegrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count\nvisualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion\nmodeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,\nvehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction\nlogging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.\nExperimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical\nrelevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,\ninfrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation\nsmart cities.",

        "summary": "Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene\nunderstanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based\non 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level\nsegmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process\nfrom ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle\nthese challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for\nhigh-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel \"split-then-grow\"\nframework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric\nprimitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.\nUnlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice\nsegmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that\njointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective\ncooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for\nsemantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the\nco-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,\nthereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object\ninstances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object\ninstances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,\nparticularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.\nExperimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that\nSGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against\ninaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object\ninstances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and\noutdoor environments.

        "summary": "The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with\nmobile-enabled convolutional neural networks (MbNets) to enhance Arabic\nHandwritten Character Recognition (AHCR). Addressing challenges like extensive\ncomputational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three\nTL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from\nscratch--using four lightweight MbNets: MobileNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and\nShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,\nHIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently\nachieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet\nexcelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB\ndataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full\nfine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The\nAHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA\nposed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy\nof 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall\nperformance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial\nfine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the\npotential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the\nway for further optimizations and broader applications.

        "summary": "Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer\nthat destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding\nhealthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of\ncryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This\nplanning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading\nto variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we\nintroduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation\nplanning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for\ncryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical\nconstraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially\nselects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward\nfunction based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy\nthat leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any\nmanually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,\nCryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the\nbest automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human\nexpert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These\nresults highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically\nviable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.",

However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to\ninefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.\nTo overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)\nstrategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to\nachieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose\na dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in\npreserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more\ncomprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.\nSpecifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace\nMamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage\nII, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba\nBlock (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar\nfeature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,\nwe introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates\nthe strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive\ninformation exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in\nperformance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word\nand synthetic LF datasets.",

While human-motion-centric approaches excel\nin preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two\ncritical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation\ninformation and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present\nWATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and\nHuman), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces\nan analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior\nefficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.\nAdditionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by\nworld models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation\ninformation beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on\nin-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nend-to-end trajectory reconstruction.

        "summary": "This paper presents a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that\nexplicitly addresses the non-Gaussian noise inherent in deep learning-based\nperception modules used for state estimation. Recognizing that accurate\nuncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe\nfeedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of\nzero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs\nset-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,\nheavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To\nimprove computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear\nprogram (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added\nslack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is\nensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic\ninvariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding\nfeedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the\nzonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and\nhardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and\na convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a\nROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides\nstable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,\nsignificantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms\nof both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.",

While recent computer vision methods have\nenabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor\ngeneralization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific\ntraining. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across\ndiverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework\nthat combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation\nvision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The\nknowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban\nobjects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the\nmodel's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies\nvisible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the\nknowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and\napplies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated\non 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean\nabsolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and\nsurpassing prior CNN-based methods.

        "summary": "Image datasets such as MNIST are a key benchmark for testing Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) architectures. The images are traditionally represented as a grid\ngraph with each node representing a pixel and edges connecting neighboring\npixels (vertically and horizontally). The graph signal is the values\n(intensities) of each pixel in the image. The graphs are commonly used as input\nto graph neural networks (e.g., Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (Graph\nCNNs) [1, 2], Graph Attention Networks (GAT) [3], GatedGCN [4]) to classify the\nimages. In this work, we improve the accuracy of downstream graph neural\nnetwork tasks by finding alternative graphs to the grid graph and superpixel\nmethods to represent the dataset images, following the approach in [5, 6]. We\nfind row correlation, column correlation, and product graphs for each image in\nMNIST and Fashion-MNIST using correlations between the pixel values building on\nthe method in [5, 6]. Experiments show that using these different graph\nrepresentations and features as input into downstream GNN models improves the\naccuracy over using the traditional grid graph and superpixel methods in the\nliterature.",

        "summary": "Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks\nremains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We\nexplore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness\nby replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby\nincreasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet\narchitectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer\nin the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD\nand AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we\ndiscover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to\ncollapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating\nadversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.\nAs a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in\nrobustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization.

However, the large\nscale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data\npresent significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature\ndifferentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present\nTemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system\ndesigned to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation\nof temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach\nleverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial\nconditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained\nVision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,\napply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent\ncombustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to\ntrack the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between\nlatent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate\nrepresentative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are\nused as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates\nnatural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The\nsystem also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case\nretrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth\nanalysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two\nexpert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz\nenhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and\nenhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.",

Multilayered windowing\nhas improved target sound localization, yet variability from shifting ambient\nnoise, diverse propagation effects, and mixed biological and anthropogenic\nsources demands robust architectures and rigorous evaluation. We introduce\nGetNetUPAM, a hierarchical nested cross-validation framework designed to\nquantify model stability under ecologically realistic variability. Data are\npartitioned into distinct site-year segments, preserving recording\nheterogeneity and ensuring each validation fold reflects a unique environmental\nsubset, reducing overfitting to localized noise and sensor artifacts. Site-year\nblocking enforces evaluation against genuine environmental diversity, while\nstandard cross-validation on random subsets measures generalization across\nUPAM's full signal distribution, a dimension absent from current benchmarks.\nUsing GetNetUPAM as the evaluation backbone, we propose the Adaptive Resolution\nPooling and Attention Network (ARPA-N), a neural architecture for irregular\nspectrogram dimensions. Adaptive pooling with spatial attention extends the\nreceptive field, capturing global context without excessive parameters. Under\nGetNetUPAM, ARPA-N achieves a 14.4% gain in average precision over DenseNet\nbaselines and a log2-scale order-of-magnitude drop in variability across all\nmetrics, enabling consistent detection across site-year folds and advancing\nscalable, accurate bioacoustic monitoring.",

These\ntasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead\nof reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to\nfocus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots\nequipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data\nacquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene\noptimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering\nhigh-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental\nlearning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful\nper-splat features to isolate objects effectively.\n  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training\ncycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the\nsemantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.\nTo balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose\nCoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS\nand then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based\neffective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the\ntraining process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for\nsemantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,\noutdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher\nnovel-view-synthesis quality.",

To fully leverage both\nlocal spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a\nhybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into\na unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively\ncapture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for\ncloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise\ninteractions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving\ndetection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance\nover existing methods.",

        "title": "Evaluating Multiple Instance Learning Strategies for Automated Sebocyte Droplet Counting",
        "summary": "Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the\naccumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key\nreadout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,\nmotivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based\nmultiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile\nRed-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet\ncounts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were\nbenchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated\npatch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50\nfeatures with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation\nshowed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)\ncompared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =\n10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that\nsimple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet\ncounting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and\nregularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.",
