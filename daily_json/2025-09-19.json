        "summary": "Recent video diffusion models demonstrate strong potential in spatial\nintelligence tasks due to their rich latent world priors. However, this\npotential is hindered by their limited controllability and geometric\ninconsistency, creating a gap between their strong priors and their practical\nuse in 3D/4D tasks. As a result, current approaches often rely on retraining or\nfine-tuning, which risks degrading pretrained knowledge and incurs high\ncomputational costs. To address this, we propose WorldForge, a training-free,\ninference-time framework composed of three tightly coupled modules. Intra-Step\nRecursive Refinement introduces a recursive refinement mechanism during\ninference, which repeatedly optimizes network predictions within each denoising\nstep to enable precise trajectory injection. Flow-Gated Latent Fusion leverages\noptical flow similarity to decouple motion from appearance in the latent space\nand selectively inject trajectory guidance into motion-related channels.\nDual-Path Self-Corrective Guidance compares guided and unguided denoising paths\nto adaptively correct trajectory drift caused by noisy or misaligned structural\nsignals. Together, these components inject fine-grained, trajectory-aligned\nguidance without training, achieving both accurate motion control and\nphotorealistic content generation. Extensive experiments across diverse\nbenchmarks validate our method's superiority in realism, trajectory\nconsistency, and visual fidelity. This work introduces a novel plug-and-play\nparadigm for controllable video synthesis, offering a new perspective on\nleveraging generative priors for spatial intelligence.",

Existing\napproaches rely on simplified prompts, neglecting the rich semantic detail in\nfull radiology reports, which reduces text image alignment and clinical\nfidelity. We propose Report2CT, a radiology report conditional latent diffusion\nframework for synthesizing 3D chest CT volumes directly from free text\nradiology reports, incorporating both findings and impression sections using\nmultiple text encoder. Report2CT integrates three pretrained medical text\nencoders (BiomedVLP CXR BERT, MedEmbed, and ClinicalBERT) to capture nuanced\nclinical context. Radiology reports and voxel spacing information condition a\n3D latent diffusion model trained on 20000 CT volumes from the CT RATE dataset.\nModel performance was evaluated using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for real\nsynthetic distributional similarity and CLIP based metrics for semantic\nalignment, with additional qualitative and quantitative comparisons against\nGenerateCT model. Report2CT generated anatomically consistent CT volumes with\nexcellent visual quality and text image alignment. Multi encoder conditioning\nimproved CLIP scores, indicating stronger preservation of fine grained clinical\ndetails in the free text radiology reports. Classifier free guidance further\nenhanced alignment with only a minor trade off in FID. We ranked first in the\nVLM3D Challenge at MICCAI 2025 on Text Conditional CT Generation and achieved\nstate of the art performance across all evaluation metrics. By leveraging\ncomplete radiology reports and multi encoder text conditioning, Report2CT\nadvances 3D CT synthesis, producing clinically faithful and high quality\nsynthetic data.",

Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either\nreconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these\ndiverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and\nmodalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer\narchitecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of\narbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we\nintroduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and\nGram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By\nemploying a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from\nsingle images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent\ntokens.

        "summary": "Accurate brain tumor segmentation is essential for preoperative evaluation\nand personalized treatment. Multi-modal MRI is widely used due to its ability\nto capture complementary tumor features across different sequences. However, in\nclinical practice, missing modalities are common, limiting the robustness and\ngeneralizability of existing deep learning methods that rely on complete\ninputs, especially under non-dominant modality combinations. To address this,\nwe propose AdaMM, a multi-modal brain tumor segmentation framework tailored for\nmissing-modality scenarios, centered on knowledge distillation and composed of\nthree synergistic modules. The Graph-guided Adaptive Refinement Module\nexplicitly models semantic associations between generalizable and\nmodality-specific features, enhancing adaptability to modality absence. The\nBi-Bottleneck Distillation Module transfers structural and textural knowledge\nfrom teacher to student models via global style matching and adversarial\nfeature alignment. The Lesion-Presence-Guided Reliability Module predicts prior\nprobabilities of lesion types through an auxiliary classification task,\neffectively suppressing false positives under incomplete inputs. Extensive\nexperiments on the BraTS 2018 and 2024 datasets demonstrate that AdaMM\nconsistently outperforms existing methods, exhibiting superior segmentation\naccuracy and robustness, particularly in single-modality and weak-modality\nconfigurations. In addition, we conduct a systematic evaluation of six\ncategories of missing-modality strategies, confirming the superiority of\nknowledge distillation and offering practical guidance for method selection and\nfuture research.

        "summary": "Training deep neural networks has become increasingly demanding, requiring\nlarge datasets and significant computational resources, especially as model\ncomplexity advances. Data distillation methods, which aim to improve data\nefficiency, have emerged as promising solutions to this challenge. In the field\nof single image super-resolution (SISR), the reliance on large training\ndatasets highlights the importance of these techniques. Recently, a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) inversion-based data distillation framework for SR\nwas proposed, showing potential for better data utilization. However, the\ncurrent method depends heavily on pre-trained SR networks and class-specific\ninformation, limiting its generalizability and applicability. To address these\nissues, we introduce a new data distillation approach for image SR that does\nnot need class labels or pre-trained SR models. In particular, we first extract\nhigh-gradient patches and categorize images based on CLIP features, then\nfine-tune a diffusion model on the selected patches to learn their distribution\nand synthesize distilled training images. Experimental results show that our\nmethod achieves state-of-the-art performance while using significantly less\ntraining data and requiring less computational time. Specifically, when we\ntrain a baseline Transformer model for SR with only 0.68\\% of the original\ndataset, the performance drop is just 0.3 dB.

        "summary": "Reconstructing high-fidelity animatable human avatars from monocular videos\nremains challenging due to insufficient geometric information in single-view\nobservations. While recent 3D Gaussian Splatting methods have shown promise,\nthey struggle with surface detail preservation due to the free-form nature of\n3D Gaussian primitives. To address both the representation limitations and\ninformation scarcity, we propose a novel method, \\textbf{FMGS-Avatar}, that\nintegrates two key innovations. First, we introduce Mesh-Guided 2D Gaussian\nSplatting, where 2D Gaussian primitives are attached directly to template mesh\nfaces with constrained position, rotation, and movement, enabling superior\nsurface alignment and geometric detail preservation. Second, we leverage\nfoundation models trained on large-scale datasets, such as Sapiens, to\ncomplement the limited visual cues from monocular videos. However, when\ndistilling multi-modal prior knowledge from foundation models, conflicting\noptimization objectives can emerge as different modalities exhibit distinct\nparameter sensitivities. We address this through a coordinated training\nstrategy with selective gradient isolation, enabling each loss component to\noptimize its relevant parameters without interference. Through this combination\nof enhanced representation and coordinated information distillation, our\napproach significantly advances 3D monocular human avatar reconstruction.\nExperimental evaluation demonstrates superior reconstruction quality compared\nto existing methods, with notable gains in geometric accuracy and appearance\nfidelity while providing rich semantic information. Additionally, the distilled\nprior knowledge within a shared canonical space naturally enables spatially and\ntemporally consistent rendering under novel views and poses.",

        "summary": "Spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG) aims at localizing the spatio-temporal\ntube of a video, as specified by the input text query. In this paper, we\nutilize multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to explore a zero-shot\nsolution in STVG. We reveal two key insights about MLLMs: (1) MLLMs tend to\ndynamically assign special tokens, referred to as \\textit{grounding tokens},\nfor grounding the text query; and (2) MLLMs often suffer from suboptimal\ngrounding due to the inability to fully integrate the cues in the text query\n(\\textit{e.g.}, attributes, actions) for inference. Based on these insights, we\npropose a MLLM-based zero-shot framework for STVG, which includes novel\ndecomposed spatio-temporal highlighting (DSTH) and temporal-augmented\nassembling (TAS) strategies to unleash the reasoning ability of MLLMs. The DSTH\nstrategy first decouples the original query into attribute and action\nsub-queries for inquiring the existence of the target both spatially and\ntemporally. It then uses a novel logit-guided re-attention (LRA) module to\nlearn latent variables as spatial and temporal prompts, by regularizing token\npredictions for each sub-query. These prompts highlight attribute and action\ncues, respectively, directing the model's attention to reliable spatial and\ntemporal related visual regions. In addition, as the spatial grounding by the\nattribute sub-query should be temporally consistent, we introduce the TAS\nstrategy to assemble the predictions using the original video frames and the\ntemporal-augmented frames as inputs to help improve temporal consistency. We\nevaluate our method on various MLLMs, and show that it outperforms SOTA methods\non three common STVG benchmarks.\n  The code will be available at https://github.com/zaiquanyang/LLaVA_Next_STVG.",

        "summary": "To reconstruct the 3D geometry from calibrated images, learning-based\nmulti-view stereo (MVS) methods typically perform multi-view depth estimation\nand then fuse depth maps into a mesh or point cloud. To improve the\ncomputational efficiency, many methods initialize a coarse depth map and then\ngradually refine it in higher resolutions. Recently, diffusion models achieve\ngreat success in generation tasks. Starting from a random noise, diffusion\nmodels gradually recover the sample with an iterative denoising process. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel MVS framework, which introduces diffusion models\nin MVS. Specifically, we formulate depth refinement as a conditional diffusion\nprocess.

As a generative paradigm originally\ndesigned for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges.\nIn this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms\nof applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We\nidentify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual\nsemantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency,\nand spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively\naddressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to\na novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models\n(ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR\nsignificantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models\nand leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings\napproximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for\nLlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.",

        "title": "A Race Bias Free Face Aging Model for Reliable Kinship Verification",
        "summary": "The age gap in kinship verification addresses the time difference between the\nphotos of the parent and the child. Moreover, their same-age photos are often\nunavailable, and face aging models are racially biased, which impacts the\nlikeness of photos. Therefore, we propose a face aging GAN model, RA-GAN,\nconsisting of two new modules, RACEpSp and a feature mixer, to produce racially\nunbiased images. The unbiased synthesized photos are used in kinship\nverification to investigate the results of verifying same-age parent-child\nimages. The experiments demonstrate that our RA-GAN outperforms SAM-GAN on an\naverage of 13.14\\% across all age groups, and CUSP-GAN in the 60+ age group by\n9.1\\% in terms of racial accuracy. Moreover, RA-GAN can preserve subjects'\nidentities better than SAM-GAN and CUSP-GAN across all age groups.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that transforming parent and child images from the\nKinFaceW-I and KinFaceW-II datasets to the same age can enhance the\nverification accuracy across all age groups. The accuracy increases with our\nRA-GAN for the kinship relationships of father-son and father-daughter,\nmother-son, and mother-daughter, which are 5.22, 5.12, 1.63, and 0.41,\nrespectively, on KinFaceW-I. Additionally, the accuracy for the relationships\nof father-daughter, father-son, and mother-son is 2.9, 0.39, and 1.6 on\nKinFaceW-II, respectively.

        "summary": "Although COLMAP has long remained the predominant method for camera parameter\noptimization in static scenes, it is constrained by its lengthy runtime and\nreliance on ground truth (GT) motion masks for application to dynamic scenes.\nMany efforts attempted to improve it by incorporating more priors as\nsupervision such as GT focal length, motion masks, 3D point clouds, camera\nposes, and metric depth, which, however, are typically unavailable in casually\ncaptured RGB videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method for more accurate\nand efficient camera parameter optimization in dynamic scenes solely supervised\nby a single RGB video. Our method consists of three key components: (1)\nPatch-wise Tracking Filters, to establish robust and maximally sparse\nhinge-like relations across the RGB video. (2) Outlier-aware Joint\nOptimization, for efficient camera parameter optimization by adaptive\ndown-weighting of moving outliers, without reliance on motion priors. (3) A\nTwo-stage Optimization Strategy, to enhance stability and optimization speed by\na trade-off between the Softplus limits and convex minima in losses. We\nvisually and numerically evaluate our camera estimates. To further validate\naccuracy, we feed the camera estimates into a 4D reconstruction method and\nassess the resulting 3D scenes, and rendered 2D RGB and depth maps. We perform\nexperiments on 4 real-world datasets (NeRF-DS, DAVIS, iPhone, and TUM-dynamics)\nand 1 synthetic dataset (MPI-Sintel), demonstrating that our method estimates\ncamera parameters more efficiently and accurately with a single RGB video as\nthe only supervision.",

The second strategy follows the first and discards the least\nmeaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these\nstrategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also\nthe gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained\nwithout additional tuning or approximations of the gradients.

        "summary": "Ultrasound imaging has become the preferred imaging modality for early cancer\nscreening due to its advantages of non-ionizing radiation, low cost, and\nreal-time imaging capabilities. However, conventional ultrasound diagnosis\nheavily relies on physician expertise, presenting challenges of high\nsubjectivity and low diagnostic efficiency. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer\npromising solutions for this issue, but existing general-purpose models\ndemonstrate limited knowledge in ultrasound medical tasks, with poor\ngeneralization in multi-organ lesion recognition and low efficiency across\nmulti-task diagnostics. To address these limitations, we propose EchoVLM, a\nvision-language model specifically designed for ultrasound medical imaging. The\nmodel employs a Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture trained on data spanning\nseven anatomical regions. This design enables the model to perform multiple\ntasks, including ultrasound report generation, diagnosis and visual\nquestion-answering (VQA). The experimental results demonstrated that EchoVLM\nachieved significant improvements of 10.15 and 4.77 points in BLEU-1 scores and\nROUGE-1 scores respectively compared to Qwen2-VL on the ultrasound report\ngeneration task. These findings suggest that EchoVLM has substantial potential\nto enhance diagnostic accuracy in ultrasound imaging, thereby providing a\nviable technical solution for future clinical applications.

        "summary": "The rapid growth of 3D digital content necessitates expandable recognition\nsystems for open-world scenarios. However, existing 3D class-incremental\nlearning methods struggle under extreme data scarcity due to geometric\nmisalignment and texture bias. While recent approaches integrate 3D data with\n2D foundation models (e.g., CLIP), they suffer from semantic blurring caused by\ntexture-biased projections and indiscriminate fusion of geometric-textural\ncues, leading to unstable decision prototypes and catastrophic forgetting. To\naddress these issues, we propose Cross-Modal Geometric Rectification (CMGR), a\nframework that enhances 3D geometric fidelity by leveraging CLIP's hierarchical\nspatial semantics. Specifically, we introduce a Structure-Aware Geometric\nRectification module that hierarchically aligns 3D part structures with CLIP's\nintermediate spatial priors through attention-driven geometric fusion.\nAdditionally, a Texture Amplification Module synthesizes minimal yet\ndiscriminative textures to suppress noise and reinforce cross-modal\nconsistency. To further stabilize incremental prototypes, we employ a\nBase-Novel Discriminator that isolates geometric variations. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves 3D few-shot\nclass-incremental learning, achieving superior geometric coherence and\nrobustness to texture bias across cross-domain and within-domain settings.",

        "summary": "Image classification has traditionally relied on parameter-intensive model\ntraining, requiring large-scale annotated datasets and extensive fine tuning to\nachieve competitive performance. While recent vision language models (VLMs)\nalleviate some of these constraints, they remain limited by their reliance on\nsingle pass representations, often failing to capture complementary aspects of\nvisual content. In this paper, we introduce Multi Agent based Reasoning for\nImage Classification (MARIC), a multi agent framework that reformulates image\nclassification as a collaborative reasoning process. MARIC first utilizes an\nOutliner Agent to analyze the global theme of the image and generate targeted\nprompts. Based on these prompts, three Aspect Agents extract fine grained\ndescriptions along distinct visual dimensions. Finally, a Reasoning Agent\nsynthesizes these complementary outputs through integrated reflection step,\nproducing a unified representation for classification. By explicitly\ndecomposing the task into multiple perspectives and encouraging reflective\nsynthesis, MARIC mitigates the shortcomings of both parameter-heavy training\nand monolithic VLM reasoning. Experiments on 4 diverse image classification\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that MARIC significantly outperforms baselines,\nhighlighting the effectiveness of multi-agent visual reasoning for robust and\ninterpretable image classification.",

        "summary": "Image retrieval remains a fundamental yet challenging problem in computer\nvision. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have\ndemonstrated strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods typically employ\nthem only for evaluation, without involving them directly in the ranking\nprocess. As a result, their rich multimodal reasoning abilities remain\nunderutilized, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel Chain-of-Thought Re-Ranking (CoTRR) method to address this issue.\nSpecifically, we design a listwise ranking prompt that enables MLLM to directly\nparticipate in re-ranking candidate images. This ranking process is grounded in\nan image evaluation prompt, which assesses how well each candidate aligns with\nusers query. By allowing MLLM to perform listwise reasoning, our method\nsupports global comparison, consistent reasoning, and interpretable\ndecision-making - all of which are essential for accurate image retrieval. To\nenable structured and fine-grained analysis, we further introduce a query\ndeconstruction prompt, which breaks down the original query into multiple\nsemantic components.

Extensive experiments on standard SISR\nbenchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in structural sharpness and\nperceptual quality over SRGAN, ESRGAN, and prior edge-attention baselines at\ncomparable model complexity.

The idea is to generate multiple\nvariants of each input image through elastic and grid deformations that\nnevertheless belong to the same class as the original input. Their predictions\nare aggregated through a confidence-guided filtering scheme that remove\nunreliable outputs, ensuring the final decision relies on consistent and\ntrustworthy cues. Extensive Experiments on PACS and Office-Home datasets\ndemonstrate consistent gains across different DG algorithms and backbones,\nhighlighting the effectiveness and generality of our approach.",

        "summary": "Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into\na shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception\nand decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to\nadversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for\nsafety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within\nCLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding\nmodest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a\ntwo-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust\nunified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on\nclean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages\ncross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between\nclean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise\ndistributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,\nAudio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the\nLanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy\nand norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without\nsacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer\nmulti-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,\nand other autonomy settings.",

To explore the potential of perceptually motivated\ninductive biases, we propose integrating classic geometric visual illusions\nwell-studied phenomena from human perception into standard image-classification\ntraining pipelines. Specifically, we introduce a synthetic, parametric\ngeometric-illusion dataset and evaluate three multi-source learning strategies\nthat combine illusion recognition tasks with ImageNet classification\nobjectives.

        "summary": "Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a\nrobotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and\nfine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in\nunstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and\ngeneralization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,\nstruggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address\nthese challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a\nMulti-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP\n(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages\nproprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both\nclose-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant\nend-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed\nby the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational\nefficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness\nnear singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world\nenvironments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates\nand reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach\ndemonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong\ngeneralization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation\nin unstructured environments.

Thus, we\npropose a fracture interactive geodesic active contour algorithm tailored for\nbone segmentation, which can better capture bone features and perform robustly\nto the presence of bone fractures and soft tissues. Inspired by orthopedic\nknowledge, we construct a novel edge-detector function that combines the\nintensity and gradient norm, which guides the contour towards bone edges\nwithout being obstructed by other soft tissues and therefore reduces\nmis-segmentation. Furthermore, distance information, where fracture prompts can\nbe embedded, is introduced into the contour evolution as an adaptive step size\nto stabilize the evolution and help the contour stop at bone edges and\nfractures. This embedding provides a way to interact with bone fractures and\nimproves the accuracy in the fracture regions.

        "summary": "U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image\nsegmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and\nlow-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections\nexhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature\nconstraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of\nfeature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is\ntransmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The\nintra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale\nfeature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global\ncontextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\nDynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer\nconnectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two\ncomplementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module\naddresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden\nrepresentations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature\nrefinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the\nintra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on\nglobal contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature\nintegration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly\nincorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across\nCNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like\nnetworks.",

Random masking treats patches independently, failing to capture\nspatial relationships consistent across orientations and overlooking semantic\nobject parts that maintain identity regardless of rotation. We propose a\ndual-stream masking approach combining 3D Spatial Grid Masking and Progressive\nSemantic Masking to address these fundamental limitations. Grid masking creates\nstructured patterns through coordinate sorting to capture geometric\nrelationships that persist across different orientations, while semantic\nmasking uses attention-driven clustering to discover semantically meaningful\nparts and maintain their coherence during masking. These complementary streams\nare orchestrated via curriculum learning with dynamic weighting, progressing\nfrom geometric understanding to semantic discovery.

        "summary": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful non-invasive\nwindow into the brain's functional organization by generating complex\nfunctional networks, typically modeled as graphs. These brain networks exhibit\na hierarchical topology that is crucial for cognitive processing. However, due\nto inherent spatial constraints, standard Euclidean GNNs struggle to represent\nthese hierarchical structures without high distortion, limiting their clinical\nperformance. To address this limitation, we propose Brain-HGCN, a geometric\ndeep learning framework based on hyperbolic geometry, which leverages the\nintrinsic property of negatively curved space to model the brain's network\nhierarchy with high fidelity. Grounded in the Lorentz model, our model employs\na novel hyperbolic graph attention layer with a signed aggregation mechanism to\ndistinctly process excitatory and inhibitory connections, ultimately learning\nrobust graph-level representations via a geometrically sound Fr\\'echet mean for\ngraph readout. Experiments on two large-scale fMRI datasets for psychiatric\ndisorder classification demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms\na wide range of state-of-the-art Euclidean baselines.

        "summary": "In recent years, parametric representations of point clouds have been widely\napplied in tasks such as memory-efficient mapping and multi-robot\ncollaboration. Highly adaptive models, like spline surfaces or quadrics, are\ncomputationally expensive in detection or fitting. In contrast, real-time\nmethods, such as Gaussian mixture models or planes, have low degrees of\nfreedom, making high accuracy with few primitives difficult. To tackle this\nproblem, a multi-model parametric representation with real-time surface\ndetection and fitting is proposed. Specifically, the Gaussian mixture model is\nfirst employed to segment the point cloud into multiple clusters. Then, flat\nclusters are selected and merged into planes or curved surfaces. Planes can be\neasily fitted and delimited by a 2D voxel-based boundary description method.\nSurfaces with curvature are fitted by B-spline surfaces and the same boundary\ndescription method is employed. Through evaluations on multiple public\ndatasets, the proposed surface detection exhibits greater robustness than the\nstate-of-the-art approach, with 3.78 times improvement in efficiency.\nMeanwhile, this representation achieves a 2-fold gain in accuracy over Gaussian\nmixture models, operating at 36.4 fps on a low-power onboard computer.",

Existing methods often rely on complete and noise-free\nobservational data, overlooking the challenges associated with out-of-sight\nobjects and the inherent noise in sensor data caused by limited camera\ncoverage, obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised\ntrajectories. These limitations pose safety risks and hinder reliable\nprediction in real-world scenarios. In this extended work, we present\nadvancements in Out-of-Sight Trajectory (OST), a novel task that predicts the\nnoise-free visual trajectories of out-of-sight objects using noisy sensor data.\nBuilding on our previous research, we broaden the scope of Out-of-Sight\nTrajectory Prediction (OOSTraj) to include pedestrians and vehicles, extending\nits applicability to autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and virtual\nreality. Our enhanced Vision-Positioning Denoising Module leverages camera\ncalibration to establish a vision-positioning mapping, addressing the lack of\nvisual references, while effectively denoising noisy sensor data in an\nunsupervised manner. Through extensive evaluations on the Vi-Fi and JRDB\ndatasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both trajectory\ndenoising and prediction, significantly surpassing previous baselines.\nAdditionally, we introduce comparisons with traditional denoising methods, such\nas Kalman filtering, and adapt recent trajectory prediction models to our task,\nproviding a comprehensive benchmark.

We introduce MSDD, a high-quality aerial image\ndataset for maize seedling stand counting, with applications in early-season\ncrop monitoring, yield prediction, and in-field management. Stand counting\ndetermines how many plants germinated, guiding timely decisions such as\nreplanting or adjusting inputs. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and\nerror-prone, while computer vision enables efficient, accurate detection. MSDD\ncontains three classes-single, double, and triple plants-capturing diverse\ngrowth stages, planting setups, soil types, lighting conditions, camera angles,\nand densities, ensuring robustness for real-world use. Benchmarking shows\ndetection is most reliable during V4-V6 stages and under nadir views. Among\ntested models, YOLO11 is fastest, while YOLOv9 yields the highest accuracy for\nsingle plants. Single plant detection achieves precision up to 0.984 and recall\nup to 0.873, but detecting doubles and triples remains difficult due to rarity\nand irregular appearance, often from planting errors. Class imbalance further\nreduces accuracy in multi-plant detection. Despite these challenges, YOLO11\nmaintains efficient inference at 35 ms per image, with an additional 120 ms for\nsaving outputs. MSDD establishes a strong foundation for developing models that\nenhance stand counting, optimize resource allocation, and support real-time\ndecision-making.

However, this reliance introduces new attack surfaces within\nthe retrieval pipeline, beyond the LLM itself. While prior RAG attacks have\nexposed such vulnerabilities, they largely rely on manipulating user queries,\nwhich is often infeasible in practice due to fixed or protected user inputs.\nThis narrow focus overlooks a more realistic and stealthy vector: instructional\nprompts, which are widely reused, publicly shared, and rarely audited. Their\nimplicit trust makes them a compelling target for adversaries to manipulate RAG\nbehavior covertly.\n  We introduce a novel attack for Adversarial Instructional Prompt (AIP) that\nexploits adversarial instructional prompts to manipulate RAG outputs by subtly\naltering retrieval behavior. By shifting the attack surface to the\ninstructional prompts, AIP reveals how trusted yet seemingly benign interface\ncomponents can be weaponized to degrade system integrity. The attack is crafted\nto achieve three goals: (1) naturalness, to evade user detection; (2) utility,\nto encourage use of prompts; and (3) robustness, to remain effective across\ndiverse query variations. We propose a diverse query generation strategy that\nsimulates realistic linguistic variation in user queries, enabling the\ndiscovery of prompts that generalize across paraphrases and rephrasings.\nBuilding on this, a genetic algorithm-based joint optimization is developed to\nevolve adversarial prompts by balancing attack success, clean-task utility, and\nstealthiness. Experimental results show that AIP achieves up to 95.23% ASR\nwhile preserving benign functionality. These findings uncover a critical and\npreviously overlooked vulnerability in RAG systems, emphasizing the need to\nreassess the shared instructional prompts.",

Performance was assessed using\nquantitative metrics (volumetric similarity, Dice similarity coefficient,\nHausdorff distance) and a qualitative measure (four-point clinical\nacceptability scale). Unet-R231 consistently outperformed TotalSegmentator and\nMedSAM in general, for different severity levels, and pathology categories\n(p<0.05). All models showed significant performance declines from mild to\nmoderate-to-severe cases, particularly in volumetric similarity (p<0.05),\nwithout significant differences among lung sides or pathology types. Unet-R231\nprovided the most accurate automated lung segmentation among evaluated models\nwith TotalSegmentator being a close second, though their performance declined\nsignificantly in moderate-to-severe cases, emphasizing the need for specialized\nmodel fine-tuning in severe pathology contexts.",

To address these limitations,\nwe propose KAMAC, a Knowledge-driven Adaptive Multi-Agent Collaboration\nframework that enables LLM agents to dynamically form and expand expert teams\nbased on the evolving diagnostic context.

This supports\nflexible, scalable collaboration in complex clinical scenarios, with decisions\nfinalized through reviewing updated agent comments. Experiments on two\nreal-world medical benchmarks demonstrate that KAMAC significantly outperforms\nboth single-agent and advanced multi-agent methods, particularly in complex\nclinical scenarios (i.e., cancer prognosis) requiring dynamic, cross-specialty\nexpertise.

        "summary": "The rapidly growing number of product categories in large-scale e-commerce\nmakes accurate object identification for automated packing in warehouses\nsubstantially more difficult. As the catalog grows, intra-class variability and\na long tail of rare or visually similar items increase, and when combined with\ndiverse packaging, cluttered containers, frequent occlusion, and large\nviewpoint changes-these factors amplify discrepancies between query and\nreference images, causing sharp performance drops for methods that rely solely\non 2D appearance features. Thus, we propose RoboEye, a two-stage identification\nframework that dynamically augments 2D semantic features with domain-adapted 3D\nreasoning and lightweight adapters to bridge training deployment gaps. In the\nfirst stage, we train a large vision model to extract 2D features for\ngenerating candidate rankings. A lightweight 3D-feature-awareness module then\nestimates 3D feature quality and predicts whether 3D re-ranking is necessary,\npreventing performance degradation and avoiding unnecessary computation. When\ninvoked, the second stage uses our robot 3D retrieval transformer, comprising a\n3D feature extractor that produces geometry-aware dense features and a\nkeypoint-based matcher that computes keypoint-correspondence confidences\nbetween query and reference images instead of conventional cosine-similarity\nscoring. Experiments show that RoboEye improves Recall@1 by 7.1% over the prior\nstate of the art (RoboLLM). Moreover, RoboEye operates using only RGB images,\navoiding reliance on explicit 3D inputs and reducing deployment costs.

Current SD-map-based\napproaches primarily focus on Bird's-Eye View (BEV) matching between images and\nmaps, overlooking a ubiquitous signal-noisy GPS. Although GPS is readily\navailable, it suffers from multipath errors in urban environments. We propose\nDiffVL, the first framework to reformulate visual localization as a GPS\ndenoising task using diffusion models. Our key insight is that noisy GPS\ntrajectory, when conditioned on visual BEV features and SD maps, implicitly\nencode the true pose distribution, which can be recovered through iterative\ndiffusion refinement. DiffVL, unlike prior BEV-matching methods (e.g.,\nOrienterNet) or transformer-based registration approaches, learns to reverse\nGPS noise perturbations by jointly modeling GPS, SD map, and visual signals,\nachieving sub-meter accuracy without relying on HD maps. Experiments on\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art\naccuracy compared to BEV-matching baselines.

        "summary": "Point cloud denoising task aims to recover the clean point cloud from the\nscanned data coupled with different levels or patterns of noise. The recent\nstate-of-the-art methods often train deep neural networks to update the point\nlocations towards the clean point cloud, and empirically repeat the denoising\nprocess several times in order to obtain the denoised results. It is not clear\nhow to efficiently arrange the iterative denoising processes to deal with\ndifferent levels or patterns of noise. In this paper, we propose an adaptive\nand iterative point cloud denoising method based on the score-based diffusion\nmodel. For a given noisy point cloud, we first estimate the noise variation and\ndetermine an adaptive denoising schedule with appropriate step sizes, then\ninvoke the trained network iteratively to update point clouds following the\nadaptive schedule. To facilitate this adaptive and iterative denoising process,\nwe design the network architecture and a two-stage sampling strategy for the\nnetwork training to enable feature fusion and gradient fusion for iterative\ndenoising. Compared to the state-of-the-art point cloud denoising methods, our\napproach obtains clean and smooth denoised point clouds, while preserving the\nshape boundary and details better. Our results not only outperform the other\nmethods both qualitatively and quantitatively, but also are preferable on the\nsynthetic dataset with different patterns of noises, as well as the\nreal-scanned dataset.",

        "title": "PRISM: Product Retrieval In Shopping Carts using Hybrid Matching",
        "summary": "Compared to traditional image retrieval tasks, product retrieval in retail\nsettings is even more challenging. Products of the same type from different\nbrands may have highly similar visual appearances, and the query image may be\ntaken from an angle that differs significantly from view angles of the stored\ncatalog images. Foundational models, such as CLIP and SigLIP, often struggle to\ndistinguish these subtle but important local differences. Pixel-wise matching\nmethods, on the other hand, are computationally expensive and incur\nprohibitively high matching times. In this paper, we propose a new, hybrid\nmethod, called PRISM, for product retrieval in retail settings by leveraging\nthe advantages of both vision-language model-based and pixel-wise matching\napproaches. To provide both efficiency/speed and finegrained retrieval\naccuracy, PRISM consists of three stages: 1) A vision-language model (SigLIP)\nis employed first to retrieve the top 35 most semantically similar products\nfrom a fixed gallery, thereby narrowing the search space significantly; 2) a\nsegmentation model (YOLO-E) is applied to eliminate background clutter; 3)\nfine-grained pixel-level matching is performed using LightGlue across the\nfiltered candidates. This framework enables more accurate discrimination\nbetween products with high inter-class similarity by focusing on subtle visual\ncues often missed by global models. Experiments performed on the ABV dataset\nshow that our proposed PRISM outperforms the state-of-the-art image retrieval\nmethods by 4.21% in top-1 accuracy while still remaining within the bounds of\nreal-time processing for practical retail deployments.",

We\nintroduce a small benchmark for testing vision-language models (VLMs) on urban\nperception using 100 Montreal street images, evenly split between photographs\nand photorealistic synthetic scenes. Twelve participants from seven community\ngroups supplied 230 annotation forms across 30 dimensions mixing physical\nattributes and subjective impressions. French responses were normalized to\nEnglish. We evaluated seven VLMs in a zero-shot setup with a structured prompt\nand deterministic parser. We use accuracy for single-choice items and Jaccard\noverlap for multi-label items; human agreement uses Krippendorff's alpha and\npairwise Jaccard. Results suggest stronger model alignment on visible,\nobjective properties than subjective appraisals. The top system (claude-sonnet)\nreaches macro 0.31 and mean Jaccard 0.48 on multi-label items.

        "summary": "With the IEEE 802.11bf Task Group introducing amendments to the WLAN standard\nfor advanced sensing, interest in using Wi-Fi Channel State Information (CSI)\nfor remote sensing has surged. Recent findings indicate that learning a unified\nthree-dimensional motion representation through Doppler Radiance Fields (DoRFs)\nderived from CSI significantly improves the generalization capabilities of\nWi-Fi-based human activity recognition (HAR). Despite this progress, CSI\nsignals remain affected by asynchronous access point (AP) clocks and additive\nnoise from environmental and hardware sources. Consequently, even with existing\npreprocessing techniques, both the CSI data and Doppler velocity projections\nused in DoRFs are still susceptible to noise and outliers, limiting HAR\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for\nmulti-antenna APs to suppress noise and identify the most informative antennas\nbased on DoRF fitting errors, which capture inconsistencies among Doppler\nvelocity projections. Experimental results on a challenging small-scale hand\ngesture recognition dataset demonstrate that the proposed DoRF-guided\nWi-Fi-based HAR approach significantly improves generalization capability,\npaving the way for robust real-world sensing deployments.",

        "summary": "Foundation models such as CLIP have demonstrated exceptional zero- and\nfew-shot transfer capabilities across diverse vision tasks. However, when\nfine-tuned for highly specialized biometric tasks, face recognition (FR),\nmorphing attack detection (MAD), and presentation attack detection (PAD), these\nmodels may suffer from over-specialization. Thus, they may lose one of their\nfoundational strengths, cross-domain generalization. In this work, we\nsystematically quantify these trade-offs by evaluating three instances of CLIP\nfine-tuned for FR, MAD, and PAD. We evaluate each adapted model as well as the\noriginal CLIP baseline on 14 general vision datasets under zero-shot and\nlinear-probe protocols, alongside common FR, MAD, and PAD benchmarks. Our\nresults indicate that fine-tuned models suffer from over-specialization,\nespecially when fine-tuned for complex tasks of FR. Also, our results pointed\nout that task complexity and classification head design, multi-class (FR) vs.\nbinary (MAD and PAD), correlate with the degree of catastrophic forgetting. The\nFRoundation model with the ViT-L backbone outperforms other approaches on the\nlarge-scale FR benchmark IJB-C, achieving an improvement of up to 58.52%.\nHowever, it experiences a substantial performance drop on ImageNetV2, reaching\nonly 51.63% compared to 69.84% achieved by the baseline CLIP model. Moreover,\nthe larger CLIP architecture consistently preserves more of the model's\noriginal generalization ability than the smaller variant, indicating that\nincreased model capacity may help mitigate over-specialization.",
