        "summary": "Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end\ncode holds significant promise for accelerating software development and\ndemocratizing design workflows. While recent large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated progress in text-to-code generation, many existing approaches rely\nsolely on natural language prompts, limiting their effectiveness in capturing\nspatial layout and visual design intent. In contrast, UI development in\npractice is inherently multimodal, often starting from visual sketches or\nmockups. To address this gap, we introduce a modular multi-agent framework that\nperforms UI-to-code generation in three interpretable stages: grounding,\nplanning, and generation. The grounding agent uses a vision-language model to\ndetect and label UI components, the planning agent constructs a hierarchical\nlayout using front-end engineering priors, and the generation agent produces\nHTML/CSS code via adaptive prompt-based synthesis. This design improves\nrobustness, interpretability, and fidelity over end-to-end black-box methods.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework into a scalable data engine that\nautomatically produces large-scale image-code pairs. Using these synthetic\nexamples, we fine-tune and reinforce an open-source VLM, yielding notable gains\nin UI understanding and code quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy,\nstructural coherence, and code correctness.

        "summary": "Human pose estimation is critical for applications such as rehabilitation,\nsports analytics, and AR/VR systems. However, rapid motion and low-light\nconditions often introduce motion blur, significantly degrading pose estimation\ndue to the domain gap between sharp and blurred images. Most datasets assume\nstable conditions, making models trained on sharp images struggle in blurred\nenvironments. To address this, we introduce a novel domain adaptation approach\nthat leverages event cameras, which capture high temporal resolution motion\ndata and are inherently robust to motion blur. Using event-based augmentation,\nwe generate motion-aware blurred images, effectively bridging the domain gap\nbetween sharp and blurred domains without requiring paired annotations.\nAdditionally, we develop a student-teacher framework that iteratively refines\npseudo-labels, leveraging mutual uncertainty masking to eliminate incorrect\nlabels and enable more effective learning. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our approach outperforms conventional domain-adaptive human pose\nestimation methods, achieving robust pose estimation under motion blur without\nrequiring annotations in the target domain. Our findings highlight the\npotential of event cameras as a scalable and effective solution for domain\nadaptation in real-world motion blur environments.

        "summary": "Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success\nof Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision\nencoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language\nmodels (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question:\nCan we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair\ndata, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for\ncontinuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this\nvision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework\nleverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four\ncomplementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative\ndescriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this\npipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset\nenriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further\npropose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by\nincorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised\nsignals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable\nimprovements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data\nscale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot\nclassification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding\ntasks.

To address this limitation, we\npropose Task-Relevant Parameter and Token Selection (TR-PTS), a task-driven\nframework that enhances both computational efficiency and accuracy.\nSpecifically, we introduce Task-Relevant Parameter Selection, which utilizes\nthe Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to identify and fine-tune only the most\ninformative parameters in a layer-wise manner, while keeping the remaining\nparameters frozen.

Existing approaches to\nreconstructing images from these intermediate features often result in blurry,\nsemantically ambiguous images. To directly address semantic leakage, we propose\nCapRecover, a cross-modality inversion framework that recovers high-level\nsemantic content, such as labels or captions, directly from intermediate\nfeatures without image reconstruction.\n  We evaluate CapRecover on multiple datasets and victim models, demonstrating\nstrong performance in semantic recovery. Specifically, CapRecover achieves up\nto 92.71% Top-1 label accuracy on CIFAR-10 and generates fluent captions from\nResNet50 features on COCO2017 with ROUGE-L scores up to 0.52. Our analysis\nfurther reveals that deeper convolutional layers encode significantly more\nsemantic information compared to shallow layers. To mitigate semantic leakage,\nwe introduce a simple yet effective protection method: adding random noise to\nintermediate features at each layer and removing the noise in the next layer.\nExperimental results show that this approach prevents semantic leakage without\nadditional training costs.",

However, these approaches face high\ntraining and inference costs, as well as challenges in extracting visual\ndetails, effectively bridging across modalities. In this work, we propose a\nnovel visual framework, MoCHA, to address these issues. Our framework\nintegrates four vision backbones (i.e., CLIP, SigLIP, DINOv2 and ConvNeXt) to\nextract complementary visual features and is equipped with a sparse Mixture of\nExperts Connectors (MoECs) module to dynamically select experts tailored to\ndifferent visual dimensions. To mitigate redundant or insufficient use of the\nvisual information encoded by the MoECs module, we further design a\nHierarchical Group Attention (HGA) with intra- and inter-group operations and\nan adaptive gating strategy for encoded visual features. We train MoCHA on two\nmainstream LLMs (e.g., Phi2-2.7B and Vicuna-7B) and evaluate their performance\nacross various benchmarks. Notably, MoCHA outperforms state-of-the-art\nopen-weight models on various tasks. For example, compared to CuMo\n(Mistral-7B), our MoCHA (Phi2-2.7B) presents outstanding abilities to mitigate\nhallucination by showing improvements of 3.25% in POPE and to follow visual\ninstructions by raising 153 points on MME. Finally, ablation studies further\nconfirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed MoECs and HGA in\nimproving the overall performance of MoCHA.",

        "summary": "Structure and continuous motion estimation from point correspondences is a\nfundamental problem in computer vision that has been powered by well-known\nalgorithms such as the familiar 5-point or 8-point algorithm. However, despite\ntheir acclaim, these algorithms are limited to processing point correspondences\noriginating from a pair of views each one representing an instantaneous capture\nof the scene. Yet, in the case of rolling shutter cameras, or more recently,\nevent cameras, this synchronization breaks down. In this work, we present a\nunified approach for structure and linear motion estimation from 2D point\ncorrespondences with arbitrary timestamps, from an arbitrary set of views. By\nformulating the problem in terms of first-order dynamics and leveraging a\nconstant velocity motion model, we derive a novel, linear point incidence\nrelation allowing for the efficient recovery of both linear velocity and 3D\npoints with predictable degeneracies and solution multiplicities. Owing to its\ngeneral formulation, it can handle correspondences from a wide range of sensing\nmodalities such as global shutter, rolling shutter, and event cameras, and can\neven combine correspondences from different collocated sensors. We validate the\neffectiveness of our solver on both simulated and real-world data, where we\nshow consistent improvement across all modalities when compared to recent\napproaches. We believe our work opens the door to efficient structure and\nmotion estimation from asynchronous data. Code can be found at\nhttps://github.com/suhang99/AsyncTrack-Motion-Solver.",

Their performance severely degrades when encountered with severe\nocclusions in the images because of the unavailability of correspondences. In\ncontrast, modern SfT methods use a correspondence-free approach by\nincorporating deep neural networks to reconstruct 3D objects, thus requiring\nhuge amounts of data for supervision.

        "summary": "Scoliosis is a prevalent condition that impacts both physical health and\nappearance, with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) being the most common\nform. Currently, the main AIS assessment tool, X-rays, poses significant\nlimitations, including radiation exposure and limited accessibility in poor and\nremote areas. To address this problem, the current solutions are using RGB\nimages to analyze spine morphology. However, RGB images are highly susceptible\nto environmental factors, such as lighting conditions, compromising model\nstability and generalizability. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel\npipeline to accurately estimate the depth information of the unclothed back,\ncompensating for the limitations of 2D information, and then estimate spine\nmorphology by integrating both depth and surface information. To capture the\nsubtle depth variations of the back surface with precision, we design an\nadaptive multiscale feature learning network named Grid-Aware Multiscale\nAdaptive Network (GAMA-Net). This model uses dual encoders to extract both\npatch-level and global features, which are then interacted by the Patch-Based\nHybrid Attention (PBHA) module. The Adaptive Multiscale Feature Fusion (AMFF)\nmodule is used to dynamically fuse information in the decoder. As a result, our\ndepth estimation model achieves remarkable accuracy across three different\nevaluation metrics, with scores of nearly 78.2%, 93.6%, and 97.5%,\nrespectively. To further validate the effectiveness of the predicted depth, we\nintegrate both surface and depth information for spine morphology estimation.\nThis integrated approach enhances the accuracy of spine curve generation,\nachieving an impressive performance of up to 97%.",

        "summary": "The shape of a cell contains essential information about its function within\nthe biological system. Segmenting these structures from large-scale 3D\nmicroscopy images is challenging, limiting clinical insights especially for\nmicroglia, immune-associated cells involved in neurodegenerative diseases.\nExisting segmentation methods mainly focus on cell bodies, struggle with\noverlapping structures, perform poorly on noisy images, require hyperparameter\ntuning for each new dataset, or rely on tedious semi-automated approaches. We\nintroduce trAIce3D, a deep-learning architecture designed for precise microglia\nsegmentation, capturing both somas and branches. It employs a two-stage\napproach: first, a 3D U-Net with vision transformers in the encoder detects\nsomas using a sliding-window technique to cover the entire image. Then, the\nsame architecture, enhanced with cross-attention blocks in skip connections,\nrefines each soma and its branches by using soma coordinates as a prompt and a\n3D window around the target cell as input. Training occurs in two phases:\nself-supervised Soma Segmentation, followed by prompt-based Branch\nSegmentation, leveraging pre-trained weights from the first phase. Trained and\nevaluated on a dataset of 41,230 microglial cells, trAIce3D significantly\nimproves segmentation accuracy and generalization, enabling scalable analysis\nof complex cellular morphologies. While optimized for microglia, its\narchitecture can extend to other intricate cell types, such as neurons and\nastrocytes, broadening its impact on neurobiological research.",

Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial\nstructure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material,\ntexture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and\nSketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional\nsketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a\nglobal description with paired localized sketch + text information for\nconditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion\nadaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches\nand text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized\nfeatures; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and\nglobal conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's\nmulti-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia\nto release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs\nare provided per image.

However, adversaries may misuse such\ntechniques to generate hateful illusions, which embed specific hate messages\ninto harmless scenes and disseminate them across web communities. In this work,\nwe take the first step toward investigating the risks of scalable hateful\nillusion generation and the potential for bypassing current content moderation\nmodels. Specifically, we generate 1,860 optical illusions using Stable\nDiffusion and ControlNet, conditioned on 62 hate messages. Of these, 1,571 are\nhateful illusions that successfully embed hate messages, either overtly or\nsubtly, forming the Hateful Illusion dataset. Using this dataset, we evaluate\nthe performance of six moderation classifiers and nine vision language models\n(VLMs) in identifying hateful illusions. Experimental results reveal\nsignificant vulnerabilities in existing moderation models: the detection\naccuracy falls below 0.245 for moderation classifiers and below 0.102 for VLMs.\nWe further identify a critical limitation in their vision encoders, which\nmainly focus on surface-level image details while overlooking the secondary\nlayer of information, i.e., hidden messages. To address this risk, we explore\npreliminary mitigation measures and identify the most effective approaches from\nthe perspectives of image transformations and training-level strategies.",

Recent research efforts have\nprogressively extended this paradigm to multimodal reasoning tasks. Due to the\ninherent complexity and diversity of multimodal tasks, especially in semantic\ncontent and problem formulations, existing models often exhibit unstable\nperformance across various domains and difficulty levels. To address these\nlimitations, we propose VL-Cogito, an advanced multimodal reasoning model\ntrained via a novel multi-stage Progressive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning\n(PCuRL) framework. PCuRL systematically guides the model through tasks of\ngradually increasing difficulty, substantially improving its reasoning\nabilities across diverse multimodal contexts. The framework introduces two key\ninnovations: (1) an online difficulty soft weighting mechanism, dynamically\nadjusting training difficulty across successive RL training stages; and (2) a\ndynamic length reward mechanism, which encourages the model to adaptively\nregulate its reasoning path length according to task complexity, thus balancing\nreasoning efficiency with correctness. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\nthat VL-Cogito consistently matches or surpasses existing reasoning-oriented\nmodels across mainstream multimodal benchmarks spanning mathematics, science,\nlogic, and general understanding, validating the effectiveness of our approach.",

OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier,\nleading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised\nsetting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot\nsetting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching\nchallenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by\nthe classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we\nshow that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD\ndetection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD\ncombines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a\nspecific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier\ntrained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is\nmodular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus\nintroduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier.\nWe evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also\nconsider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label\nnoise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been\npreviously overlooked.

        "summary": "Network compression techniques have become increasingly important in recent\nyears because the loads of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are heavy for edge\ndevices in real-world applications. While many methods compress neural network\nparameters, deploying these models on edge devices remains challenging. To\naddress this, we propose the fractional Gaussian filter and pruning (FGFP)\nframework, which integrates fractional-order differential calculus and Gaussian\nfunction to construct fractional Gaussian filters (FGFs). To reduce the\ncomputational complexity of fractional-order differential operations, we\nintroduce Gr\\\"unwald-Letnikov fractional derivatives to approximate the\nfractional-order differential equation. The number of parameters for each\nkernel in FGF is minimized to only seven. Beyond the architecture of Fractional\nGaussian Filters, our FGFP framework also incorporates Adaptive Unstructured\nPruning (AUP) to achieve higher compression ratios. Experiments on various\narchitectures and benchmarks show that our FGFP framework outperforms recent\nmethods in accuracy and compression. On CIFAR-10, ResNet-20 achieves only a\n1.52% drop in accuracy while reducing the model size by 85.2%.

        "summary": "Achieving pixel-level segmentation with low computational cost using\nmultimodal data remains a key challenge in crack segmentation tasks. Existing\nmethods lack the capability for adaptive perception and efficient interactive\nfusion of cross-modal features. To address these challenges, we propose a\nLightweight Adaptive Cue-Aware Vision Mamba network (LIDAR), which efficiently\nperceives and integrates morphological and textural cues from different\nmodalities under multimodal crack scenarios, generating clear pixel-level crack\nsegmentation maps. Specifically, LIDAR is composed of a Lightweight Adaptive\nCue-Aware Visual State Space module (LacaVSS) and a Lightweight Dual Domain\nDynamic Collaborative Fusion module (LD3CF). LacaVSS adaptively models crack\ncues through the proposed mask-guided Efficient Dynamic Guided Scanning\nStrategy (EDG-SS), while LD3CF leverages an Adaptive Frequency Domain\nPerceptron (AFDP) and a dual-pooling fusion strategy to effectively capture\nspatial and frequency-domain cues across modalities. Moreover, we design a\nLightweight Dynamically Modulated Multi-Kernel convolution (LDMK) to perceive\ncomplex morphological structures with minimal computational overhead, replacing\nmost convolutional operations in LIDAR. Experiments on three datasets\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.\nOn the light-field depth dataset, our method achieves 0.8204 in F1 and 0.8465\nin mIoU with only 5.35M parameters.

        "summary": "Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation (UVOS) aims to predict pixel-level\nmasks for the most salient objects in videos without any prior annotations.\nWhile memory mechanisms have been proven critical in various video segmentation\nparadigms, their application in UVOS yield only marginal performance gains\ndespite sophisticated design. Our analysis reveals a simple but fundamental\nflaw in existing methods: over-reliance on memorizing high-level semantic\nfeatures. UVOS inherently suffers from the deficiency of lacking fine-grained\ninformation due to the absence of pixel-level prior knowledge. Consequently,\nmemory design relying solely on high-level features, which predominantly\ncapture abstract semantic cues, is insufficient to generate precise\npredictions. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose a novel hierarchical\nmemory architecture to incorporate both shallow- and high-level features for\nmemory, which leverages the complementary benefits of pixel and semantic\ninformation. Furthermore, to balance the simultaneous utilization of the pixel\nand semantic memory features, we propose a heterogeneous interaction mechanism\nto perform pixel-semantic mutual interactions, which explicitly considers their\ninherent feature discrepancies. Through the design of Pixel-guided Local\nAlignment Module (PLAM) and Semantic-guided Global Integration Module (SGIM),\nwe achieve delicate integration of the fine-grained details in shallow-level\nmemory and the semantic representations in high-level memory. Our Hierarchical\nMemory with Heterogeneous Interaction Network (HMHI-Net) consistently achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across all UVOS and video saliency detection\nbenchmarks.

This motivates us to leverage the diffusion prior, one of the most\npowerful natural image priors. However, while the diffusion prior can help\ngenerate visually plausible results, using it to restore task-relevant details\nremains challenging, even when combined with recent TDIR methods. To address\nthis, we propose EDTR, which effectively harnesses the power of diffusion prior\nto restore task-relevant details. Specifically, we propose directly leveraging\nuseful clues from LQ images in the diffusion process by generating from\npixel-error-based pre-restored LQ images with mild noise added. Moreover, we\nemploy a small number of denoising steps to prevent the generation of redundant\ndetails that dilute crucial task-related information.

        "summary": "Self-supervised learning methods like masked autoencoders (MAE) have shown\nsignificant promise in learning robust feature representations, particularly in\nimage reconstruction-based pretraining task. However, their performance is\noften strongly dependent on the masking strategies used during training and can\ndegrade when applied to out-of-distribution data. To address these limitations,\nwe introduce the masked implicit neural representations (MINR) framework that\nsynergizes implicit neural representations with masked image modeling. MINR\nlearns a continuous function to represent images, enabling more robust and\ngeneralizable reconstructions irrespective of masking strategies. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that MINR not only outperforms MAE in in-domain\nscenarios but also in out-of-distribution settings, while reducing model\ncomplexity. The versatility of MINR extends to various self-supervised learning\napplications, confirming its utility as a robust and efficient alternative to\nexisting frameworks.",

        "summary": "Understanding individual, group and event level emotions along with\ncontextual information is crucial for analyzing a multi-person social\nsituation. To achieve this, we frame emotion comprehension as the task of\npredicting fine-grained individual emotion to coarse grained group and event\nlevel emotion. We introduce GEMS that leverages a multimodal swin-transformer\nand S3Attention based architecture, which processes an input scene, group\nmembers, and context information to generate joint predictions. Existing\nmulti-person emotion related benchmarks mainly focus on atomic interactions\nprimarily based on emotion perception over time and group level. To this end,\nwe extend and propose VGAF-GEMS to provide more fine grained and holistic\nanalysis on top of existing group level annotation of VGAF dataset. GEMS aims\nto predict basic discrete and continuous emotions (including valence and\narousal) as well as individual, group and event level perceived emotions. Our\nbenchmarking effort links individual, group and situational emotional responses\nholistically. The quantitative and qualitative comparisons with adapted\nstate-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of GEMS framework on\nVGAF-GEMS benchmarking.

However, existing methods\ntypically provide only one-shot change masks or static captions, limiting their\nability to support interactive, query-driven analysis. In this work, we\nintroduce remote sensing image change analysis (RSICA) as a new paradigm that\ncombines the strengths of change detection and visual question answering to\nenable multi-turn, instruction-guided exploration of changes in bi-temporal\nremote sensing images. To support this task, we construct ChangeChat-105k, a\nlarge-scale instruction-following dataset, generated through a hybrid\nrule-based and GPT-assisted process, covering six interaction types: change\ncaptioning, classification, quantification, localization, open-ended question\nanswering, and multi-turn dialogues. Building on this dataset, we propose\nDeltaVLM, an end-to-end architecture tailored for interactive RSICA. DeltaVLM\nfeatures three innovations: (1) a fine-tuned bi-temporal vision encoder to\ncapture temporal differences; (2) a visual difference perception module with a\ncross-semantic relation measuring (CSRM) mechanism to interpret changes; and\n(3) an instruction-guided Q-former to effectively extract query-relevant\ndifference information from visual changes, aligning them with textual\ninstructions. We train DeltaVLM on ChangeChat-105k using a frozen large\nlanguage model, adapting only the vision and alignment modules to optimize\nefficiency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that\nDeltaVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-turn captioning\nand multi-turn interactive change analysis, outperforming existing multimodal\nlarge language models and remote sensing vision-language models.

To overcome this limitation, we\nintroduce a novel adaptation framework that enables pretrained pose-free\nfeed-forward 3DGS models to handle unfavorable views. We leverage priors\nlearned from favorable images by feeding recentered images into a pretrained\nmodel augmented with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers. We further propose a\nGaussian adapter module to enhance the geometric consistency of the Gaussians\nderived from the recentered inputs, along with a Gaussian alignment method to\nrender accurate target views for training.

Quantitative fidelity of PET uptake\nwithin clinically relevant regions.

However, CLIP struggles with\npotential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from\nentangled representation. On the one hand, short captions for a single image in\ndatasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image, leaving the\nmodel uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the\nother hand, directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the\nretention of entangled details, preventing the model from learning\ndisentangled, atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on\ncertain downstream tasks involving short prompts.\n  In this paper, we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible\nalignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of\ngranularity. Specifically, our framework ensures that a model can not only\n\\emph{preserve} cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also\n\\emph{disentangle} visual representations to capture fine-grained textual\nconcepts. Building on this foundation, we introduce \\ours, a novel approach\nthat identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations\nin a modular manner.

        "summary": "Rapid progress in terrain-aware autonomous ground navigation has been driven\nby advances in supervised semantic segmentation. However, these methods rely on\ncostly data collection and labor-intensive ground truth labeling to train deep\nmodels.

Recent zero-shot\napproaches to unsupervised segmentation have shown promise in such settings but\ntypically operate on individual frames, lacking temporal consistency-a critical\nproperty for robust perception in unstructured environments.

        "summary": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) are pathologic dilatations of the abdominal\naorta posing a high fatality risk upon rupture. Studying AAA progression and\nrupture risk often involves in-silico blood flow modelling with computational\nfluid dynamics (CFD) and extraction of hemodynamic factors like time-averaged\nwall shear stress (TAWSS) or oscillatory shear index (OSI). However, CFD\nsimulations are known to be computationally demanding. Hence, in recent years,\ngeometric deep learning methods, operating directly on 3D shapes, have been\nproposed as compelling surrogates, estimating hemodynamic parameters in just a\nfew seconds. In this work, we propose a geometric deep learning approach to\nestimating hemodynamics in AAA patients, and study its generalisability to\ncommon factors of real-world variation. We propose an E(3)-equivariant deep\nlearning model utilising novel robust geometrical descriptors and projective\ngeometric algebra. Our model is trained to estimate transient WSS using a\ndataset of CT scans of 100 AAA patients, from which lumen geometries are\nextracted and reference CFD simulations with varying boundary conditions are\nobtained. Results show that the model generalizes well within the distribution,\nas well as to the external test set. Moreover, the model can accurately\nestimate hemodynamics across geometry remodelling and changes in boundary\nconditions. Furthermore, we find that a trained model can be applied to\ndifferent artery tree topologies, where new and unseen branches are added\nduring inference. Finally, we find that the model is to a large extent agnostic\nto mesh resolution. These results show the accuracy and generalisation of the\nproposed model, and highlight its potential to contribute to hemodynamic\nparameter estimation in clinical practice.",

This setup is more flexible and practical than\nconventional human action recognition tasks. However, existing benchmarks\ndesigned for traditional action recognition fail to address the unique\ncomplexities in N-HRI due to limited data, modalities, task categories, and\ndiversity of subjects and environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce ACTIVE (Action from Robotic View), a large-scale dataset tailored\nspecifically for perception-centric robotic views prevalent in mobile service\nrobots. ACTIVE comprises 30 composite action categories, 80 participants, and\n46,868 annotated video instances, covering both RGB and point cloud modalities.\nParticipants performed various human actions in diverse environments at\ndistances ranging from 3m to 50m, while the camera platform was also mobile,\nsimulating real-world scenarios of robot perception with varying camera heights\ndue to uneven ground. This comprehensive and challenging benchmark aims to\nadvance action and attribute recognition research in N-HRI. Furthermore, we\npropose ACTIVE-PC, a method that accurately perceives human actions at long\ndistances using Multilevel Neighborhood Sampling, Layered Recognizers, Elastic\nEllipse Query, and precise decoupling of kinematic interference from human\nactions.

        "summary": "Video signals are vulnerable in multimedia communication and storage systems,\nas even slight bitstream-domain corruption can lead to significant pixel-domain\ndegradation. To recover faithful spatio-temporal content from corrupted inputs,\nbitstream-corrupted video recovery has recently emerged as a challenging and\nunderstudied task. However, existing methods require time-consuming and\nlabor-intensive annotation of corrupted regions for each corrupted video frame,\nresulting in a large workload in practice. In addition, high-quality recovery\nremains difficult as part of the local residual information in corrupted frames\nmay mislead feature completion and successive content recovery. In this paper,\nwe propose the first blind bitstream-corrupted video recovery framework that\nintegrates visual foundation models with a recovery model, which is adapted to\ndifferent types of corruption and bitstream-level prompts. Within the\nframework, the proposed Detect Any Corruption (DAC) model leverages the rich\npriors of the visual foundation model while incorporating bitstream and\ncorruption knowledge to enhance corruption localization and blind recovery.\nAdditionally, we introduce a novel Corruption-aware Feature Completion (CFC)\nmodule, which adaptively processes residual contributions based on high-level\ncorruption understanding. With VFM-guided hierarchical feature augmentation and\nhigh-level coordination in a mixture-of-residual-experts (MoRE) structure, our\nmethod suppresses artifacts and enhances informative residuals. Comprehensive\nevaluations show that the proposed method achieves outstanding performance in\nbitstream-corrupted video recovery without requiring a manually labeled mask\nsequence.

        "summary": "Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical\nsince it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert\nannotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution\nusing the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of\ngenerative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated\nimpressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent\nstochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their\neffectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed\nmethod leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based\ngenerative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate\nsegmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling\nmultiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose\npixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This\nsampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,\noffering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive\nsegmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper\ninsights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes.

Traditional methods have struggled\nwith domain generalization, temporal consistency, and computational efficiency.\nThe emergence of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and\nits successor, SAM2, has introduced a paradigm shift, enabling prompt-driven\nsegmentation with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon these\nadvances, this survey provides a comprehensive review of SAM/SAM2-based methods\nfor VOST, structured along three temporal dimensions: past, present, and\nfuture. We examine strategies for retaining and updating historical information\n(past), approaches for extracting and optimizing discriminative features from\nthe current frame (present), and motion prediction and trajectory estimation\nmechanisms for anticipating object dynamics in subsequent frames (future). In\ndoing so, we highlight the evolution from early memory-based architectures to\nthe streaming memory and real-time segmentation capabilities of SAM2. We also\ndiscuss recent innovations such as motion-aware memory selection and\ntrajectory-guided prompting, which aim to enhance both accuracy and efficiency.\nFinally, we identify remaining challenges including memory redundancy, error\naccumulation, and prompt inefficiency, and suggest promising directions for\nfuture research.

        "summary": "While data-driven trajectory prediction has enhanced the reliability of\nautonomous driving systems, it still struggles with rarely observed long-tail\nscenarios. Prior works addressed this by modifying model architectures, such as\nusing hypernetworks. In contrast, we propose refining the training process to\nunlock each model's potential without altering its structure. We introduce\nGenerative Active Learning for Trajectory prediction (GALTraj), the first\nmethod to successfully deploy generative active learning into trajectory\nprediction. It actively identifies rare tail samples where the model fails and\naugments these samples with a controllable diffusion model during training. In\nour framework, generating scenarios that are diverse, realistic, and preserve\ntail-case characteristics is paramount. Accordingly, we design a tail-aware\ngeneration method that applies tailored diffusion guidance to generate\ntrajectories that both capture rare behaviors and respect traffic rules. Unlike\nprior simulation methods focused solely on scenario diversity, GALTraj is the\nfirst to show how simulator-driven augmentation benefits long-tail learning in\ntrajectory prediction. Experiments on multiple trajectory datasets (WOMD,\nArgoverse2) with popular backbones (QCNet, MTR) confirm that our method\nsignificantly boosts performance on tail samples and also enhances accuracy on\nhead samples.",

Ultrasound (US), as a safe and accessible imaging\nmodality, is extensively employed in breast abnormality screening and\ndiagnosis. However, the incidence of different subtypes exhibits a skewed\nlong-tailed distribution, posing significant challenges for automated\nrecognition. Generative augmentation provides a promising solution to rectify\ndata distribution. Inspired by this, we propose a dual-phase framework for\nlong-tailed classification that mitigates distributional bias through\nhigh-fidelity data synthesis while avoiding overuse that corrupts holistic\nperformance. The framework incorporates a reinforcement learning-driven\nadaptive sampler, dynamically calibrating synthetic-real data ratios by\ntraining a strategic multi-agent to compensate for scarcities of real data\nwhile ensuring stable discriminative capability. Furthermore, our\nclass-controllable synthetic network integrates a sketch-grounded perception\nbranch that harnesses anatomical priors to maintain distinctive class features\nwhile enabling annotation-free inference. Extensive experiments on an in-house\nlong-tailed and a public imbalanced breast US datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves promising performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.\nMore synthetic images can be found at\nhttps://github.com/Stinalalala/Breast-LT-GenAug.",

To address these issue, we propose\nSpectral-based Spatial Grouping Transformer (SSGformer), a novel approach that\nleverages spectral decomposition and group-wise attention for multi-weather\nimage restoration. SSGformer decomposes images into high-frequency edge\nfeatures using conventional edge detection and low-frequency information via\nSingular Value Decomposition. We utilize multi-head linear attention to\neffectively model the relationship between these features. The fused features\nare integrated with the input to generate a grouping-mask that clusters regions\nbased on the spatial similarity and image texture. To fully leverage this mask,\nwe introduce a group-wise attention mechanism, enabling robust adverse weather\nremoval and ensuring consistent performance across diverse weather conditions.\nWe also propose a Spatial Grouping Transformer Block that uses both channel\nattention and spatial attention, effectively balancing feature-wise\nrelationships and spatial dependencies.

Motivated by this ability, this paper\nintroduces generalized face discovery (GFD), a novel open-world face\nrecognition task that unifies traditional face identification with generalized\ncategory discovery (GCD). GFD requires recognizing both labeled and unlabeled\nknown identities (IDs) while simultaneously discovering new, previously unseen\nIDs. Unlike typical GCD settings, GFD poses unique challenges due to the high\ncardinality and fine-grained nature of face IDs, rendering existing GCD\napproaches ineffective. To tackle this problem, we propose FaceGCD, a method\nthat dynamically constructs instance-specific feature extractors using\nlightweight, layer-wise prefixes. These prefixes are generated on the fly by a\nHyperNetwork, which adaptively outputs a set of prefix generators conditioned\non each input image. This dynamic design enables FaceGCD to capture subtle\nidentity-specific cues without relying on high-capacity static models.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that FaceGCD significantly outperforms\nexisting GCD methods and a strong face recognition baseline, ArcFace, achieving\nstate-of-the-art results on the GFD task and advancing toward open-world face\nrecognition.",

Traditional diagnostic workflows,\nhowever, often depend on manual interpretation and are both time- and\nresource-intensive. To address these limitations, we propose an automated and\ninterpretable clinical decision support framework based on a hybrid feature\nextraction model called HOG-CNN. Our key contribution lies in the integration\nof handcrafted Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features with deep\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) representations. This fusion enables our\nmodel to capture both local texture patterns and high-level semantic features\nfrom retinal fundus images. We evaluated our model on three public benchmark\ndatasets: APTOS 2019 (for binary and multiclass DR classification), ORIGA (for\nGlaucoma detection), and IC-AMD (for AMD diagnosis); HOG-CNN demonstrates\nconsistently high performance. It achieves 98.5\\% accuracy and 99.2 AUC for\nbinary DR classification, and 94.2 AUC for five-class DR classification. On the\nIC-AMD dataset, it attains 92.8\\% accuracy, 94.8\\% precision, and 94.5 AUC,\noutperforming several state-of-the-art models. For Glaucoma detection on ORIGA,\nour model achieves 83.9\\% accuracy and 87.2 AUC, showing competitive\nperformance despite dataset limitations. We show, through comprehensive\nappendix studies, the complementary strength of combining HOG and CNN features.\nThe model's lightweight and interpretable design makes it particularly suitable\nfor deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.

        "title": "DISTIL: Data-Free Inversion of Suspicious Trojan Inputs via Latent Diffusion",
        "summary": "Deep neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success across numerous\ntasks, yet they remain vulnerable to Trojan (backdoor) attacks, raising serious\nconcerns about their safety in real-world mission-critical applications. A\ncommon countermeasure is trigger inversion -- reconstructing malicious\n\"shortcut\" patterns (triggers) inserted by an adversary during training.\nCurrent trigger-inversion methods typically search the full pixel space under\nspecific assumptions but offer no assurances that the estimated trigger is more\nthan an adversarial perturbation that flips the model output. Here, we propose\na data-free, zero-shot trigger-inversion strategy that restricts the search\nspace while avoiding strong assumptions on trigger appearance. Specifically, we\nincorporate a diffusion-based generator guided by the target classifier;\nthrough iterative generation, we produce candidate triggers that align with the\ninternal representations the model relies on for malicious behavior. Empirical\nevaluations, both quantitative and qualitative, show that our approach\nreconstructs triggers that effectively distinguish clean versus Trojaned\nmodels. DISTIL surpasses alternative methods by high margins, achieving up to\n7.1% higher accuracy on the BackdoorBench dataset and a 9.4% improvement on\ntrojaned object detection model scanning, offering a promising new direction\nfor reliable backdoor defense without reliance on extensive data or strong\nprior assumptions about triggers.

However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound\nimages for these measurements heavily depends on the expertise of sonographers,\nposing a significant challenge in low-income countries due to the scarcity of\ntrained personnel. To address this issue, we leverage FetalCLIP, a\nvision-language model pretrained on a curated dataset of over 210,000 fetal\nultrasound image-caption pairs, to perform automated fetal ultrasound image\nquality assessment (IQA) on blind-sweep ultrasound data. We introduce\nFetalCLIP$_{CLS}$, an IQA model adapted from FetalCLIP using Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA), and evaluate it on the ACOUSLIC-AI dataset against six CNN\nand Transformer baselines. FetalCLIP$_{CLS}$ achieves the highest F1 score of\n0.757. Moreover, we show that an adapted segmentation model, when repurposed\nfor classification, further improves performance, achieving an F1 score of\n0.771.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Shortcut-based Fine-Tuning (ShortFT), an efficient fine-tuning\nstrategy that utilizes the shorter denoising chain. More specifically, we\nemploy the recently researched trajectory-preserving few-step diffusion model,\nwhich enables a shortcut over the original denoising chain, and construct a\nshortcut-based denoising chain of shorter length. The optimization on this\nchain notably enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning the\nfoundational model.

Existing\nenhancement methods often struggle to adaptively handle diverse degradation\nconditions and fail to leverage underwater-specific physical priors\neffectively. In this paper, we propose a degradation-aware conditional\ndiffusion model to enhance underwater images adaptively and robustly. Given a\ndegraded underwater image as input, we first predict its degradation level\nusing a lightweight dual-stream convolutional network, generating a continuous\ndegradation score as semantic guidance. Based on this score, we introduce a\nnovel conditional diffusion-based restoration network with a Swin UNet\nbackbone, enabling adaptive noise scheduling and hierarchical feature\nrefinement. To incorporate underwater-specific physical priors, we further\npropose a degradation-guided adaptive feature fusion module and a hybrid loss\nfunction that combines perceptual consistency, histogram matching, and\nfeature-level contrast. Comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our method effectively restores underwater images with\nsuperior colour fidelity, perceptual quality, and structural details.

RCR-AF\nuniquely combines the advantages of GELU (including smoothness, gradient\nstability, and negative information retention) with ReLU's desirable\nmonotonicity, while simultaneously controlling both model sparsity and capacity\nthrough built-in clipping mechanisms governed by two hyperparameters, $\\alpha$\nand $\\gamma$. Our theoretical analysis, grounded in Rademacher complexity,\ndemonstrates that these parameters directly modulate the model's Rademacher\ncomplexity, offering a principled approach to enhance robustness. Comprehensive\nempirical evaluations show that RCR-AF consistently outperforms widely-used\nalternatives (ReLU, GELU, and Swish) in both clean accuracy under standard\ntraining and in adversarial robustness within adversarial training paradigms.",

However, existing learning-based approaches for LLD detection are\noften constrained by limited sample sizes (e.g., tens), which poses significant\nchallenges for reliable model training and generalization. Although\nincorporating auxiliary datasets can expand the training set, substantial\ndomain heterogeneity, such as differences in imaging protocols, scanner\nhardware, and population demographics, often undermines cross-domain\ntransferability. To address this issue, we propose a Collaborative Domain\nAdaptation (CDA) framework for LLD detection using T1-weighted MRIs. The CDA\nleverages a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture global anatomical context and a\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract local structural features, with\neach branch comprising an encoder and a classifier. The CDA framework consists\nof three stages: (a) supervised training on labeled source data, (b)\nself-supervised target feature adaptation and (c) collaborative training on\nunlabeled target data. We first train ViT and CNN on source data, followed by\nself-supervised target feature adaptation by minimizing the discrepancy between\nclassifier outputs from two branches to make the categorical boundary clearer.\nThe collaborative training stage employs pseudo-labeled and augmented\ntarget-domain MRIs, enforcing prediction consistency under strong and weak\naugmentation to enhance domain robustness and generalization.

Deep learning (DL)-based segmentation\noffers promising tools for tumour delineation, yet its performance across\nheterogeneous PBT subtypes and MRI protocols remains uncertain. Methods A\nretrospective single-centre cohort of 174 paediatric patients with HGG, LGG,\nmedulloblastomas (MB), ependymomas, and other rarer subtypes was used. MRI\nsequences included T1, T1 post-contrast (T1-C), T2, and FLAIR. Manual\nannotations were provided for four tumour subregions: whole tumour (WT),\nT2-hyperintensity (T2H), enhancing tumour (ET), and cystic component (CC). A 3D\nnnU-Net model was trained and tested (121/53 split), with segmentation\nperformance assessed using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and compared\nagainst intra- and inter-rater variability. Results The model achieved robust\nperformance for WT and T2H (mean DSC: 0.85), comparable to human annotator\nvariability (mean DSC: 0.86). ET segmentation was moderately accurate (mean\nDSC: 0.75), while CC performance was poor. Segmentation accuracy varied by\ntumour type, MRI sequence combination, and location. Notably, T1, T1-C, and T2\nalone produced results nearly equivalent to the full protocol. Conclusions DL\nis feasible for PBTs, particularly for T2H and WT. Challenges remain for ET and\nCC segmentation, highlighting the need for further refinement. These findings\nsupport the potential for protocol simplification and automation to enhance\nvolumetric assessment and streamline paediatric neuro-oncology workflows.",

        "title": "Mesh based segmentation for automated margin line generation on incisors receiving crown treatment",
        "summary": "Dental crowns are essential dental treatments for restoring damaged or\nmissing teeth of patients. Recent design approaches of dental crowns are\ncarried out using commercial dental design software. Once a scan of a\npreparation is uploaded to the software, a dental technician needs to manually\ndefine a precise margin line on the preparation surface, which constitutes a\nnon-repeatable and inconsistent procedure. This work proposes a new framework\nto determine margin lines automatically and accurately using deep learning. A\ndataset of incisor teeth was provided by a collaborating dental laboratory to\ntrain a deep learning segmentation model. A mesh-based neural network was\nmodified by changing its input channels and used to segment the prepared tooth\ninto two regions such that the margin line is contained within the boundary\nfaces separating the two regions. Next, k-fold cross-validation was used to\ntrain 5 models, and a voting classifier technique was used to combine their\nresults to enhance the segmentation. After that, boundary smoothing and\noptimization using the graph cut method were applied to refine the segmentation\nresults. Then, boundary faces separating the two regions were selected to\nrepresent the margin line faces. A spline was approximated to best fit the\ncenters of the boundary faces to predict the margin line. Our results show that\nan ensemble model combined with maximum probability predicted the highest\nnumber of successful test cases (7 out of 13) based on a maximum distance\nthreshold of 200 m (representing human error) between the predicted and ground\ntruth point clouds. It was also demonstrated that the better the quality of the\npreparation, the smaller the divergence between the predicted and ground truth\nmargin lines (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of -0.683). We provide\nthe train and test datasets for the community.",

During inference, depth further guides DDIM\nsampling and layout optimization, enhancing alignment between the\nreconstruction and the input image.

        "summary": "End-to-end (E2E) designed imaging systems integrate coded optical designs\nwith decoding algorithms to enhance imaging fidelity for diverse visual tasks.\nHowever, existing E2E designs encounter significant challenges in maintaining\nhigh image fidelity at wide fields of view, due to high computational\ncomplexity, as well as difficulties in modeling off-axis wave propagation while\naccounting for off-axis aberrations. In particular, the common approach of\nplacing the encoding element into the aperture or pupil plane results in only a\nglobal control of the wavefront. To overcome these limitations, this work\nexplores an additional design choice by positioning a DOE off-aperture,\nenabling a spatial unmixing of the degrees of freedom and providing local\ncontrol over the wavefront over the image plane. Our approach further leverages\nhybrid refractive-diffractive optical systems by linking differentiable ray and\nwave optics modeling, thereby optimizing depth imaging quality and\ndemonstrating system versatility. Experimental results reveal that the\noff-aperture DOE enhances the imaging quality by over 5 dB in PSNR at a FoV of\napproximately $45^\\circ$ when paired with a simple thin lens, outperforming\ntraditional on-aperture systems. Furthermore, we successfully recover color and\ndepth information at nearly $28^\\circ$ FoV using off-aperture DOE\nconfigurations with compound optics. Physical prototypes for both applications\nvalidate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed method.",
