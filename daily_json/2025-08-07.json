        "summary": "This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for\ndiffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a\nconditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a\ndual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding\n(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global\ntemporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire\nstreamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which\nleverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline\npropagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI\ndatasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two\nwell-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and\nTractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight\nDDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning\nvarying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.\nCollectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,\npresenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad\ndMRI applications.

        "summary": "Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a\nchallenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios\ninvolving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the\nT2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of\ncurrent generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion\ncontrol methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or\nexperience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,\nprimarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by\ncompositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered\ngeneration enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within\na video, positioning each element on a distinct \"layer\" and thus facilitating\ncoherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation\nprocess. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in\ngenerating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x\nimprovements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.\nProject page and code are available at https://kr-panghu.github.io/LayerT2V/ .",

To address this limitation, we propose\nANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under\nsuch perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by\nfusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered\nto form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt\ntokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper\nlayers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware\nvisual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype\n(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,\nANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by\ncomputing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard\ncross-entropy and sim loss.

In this paper, we present\nHierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:\nDM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish\nsemantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.\nHierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical\nPosition Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks\nbased on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which\nsystematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic\nstructural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts\nknowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity\nvariations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models\ninto a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the\nquality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight\nquantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction\n(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on\nserver and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score\nand 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our\ncomprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that\nHierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model\nwhile significantly outperforming prior works.",

However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time\nseries remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality\ngap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time\nseries; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB\nthree-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with\narbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between\nthe deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for\nuncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose\nVisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on\nlarge-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a\nvision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series\ndata, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)\na colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time\nseries into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate\ndependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel\nreconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus\nmore flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive\nprior distributional assumptions.

        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across\ndiverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,\nenabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major\nchallenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are\nparticularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal\ncontinual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal\nfeature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and\nzero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and\nsystematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by\nidentifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.\nBased on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to\ntheir target problems: (1) \\textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address\ncross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)\n\\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during\nupdates; and (3) \\textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter\ninterference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current\nevaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better\nbenchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional\ngeneralization.

Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based\non Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared\nrepresentation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal\nflickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of\ngeometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and\ninterpretability. To address this, we propose \\textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel\nframework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and\ndynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and\nallowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents\nmotion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent\nappearance refinement.

Most\nexisting pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing\nsimilar parameters while merging divergent ones.

While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it\nstruggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when\nthe weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting\nin the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA\nFusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with\nin-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,\nwhich dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains\nthrough learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task\nvector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the\norientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed\nby a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation.

        "summary": "We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework\ndesigned to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory\ncontrol. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,\nIDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within\na unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework\nstrengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more\nprecise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of\nthis camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct\na camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth\nmaps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision\nwith notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce\na geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,\nenhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that\nIDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual\nquality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the\ngenerated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene\nreconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the\npractical benefits of our joint learning framework.

        "summary": "Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of\nvideo content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods\nrely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific\ntraining videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes\nin the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training\nparadigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but\nnoisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for\npretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video\nalignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated\nhigh-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the\nrequired human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each\nframe to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window\nattention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video\ngenerator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\\% additional trainable\nparameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the\ngenerator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark\nwith videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\\times$ more diverse than previous\nbenchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces\nreliance on manual curation by over 10$\\times$, while generalizing to many open\nclasses.",

Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate\nexternal knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to\nautonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,\neliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and\nproviding interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency\nmaps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing\ntransparency in deepfake identification.

In this work, we introduce a novel deep-learning framework\nfor generating continuous, age-specific fetal brain atlases for real-time fetal\nbrain tissue segmentation.

In this paper, we rethink the\nVideo TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel\nmodel termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result\nfor each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is\ndesigned to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and\ntextual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.\nThen, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an\ninstance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish\nspatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.\nExtensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the\neffectiveness and generalization of our framework.

To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level\noccupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the\nspatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core\ndesigns: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical\ninformation and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and\na memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the\nspatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our\nmethod significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D\noccupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between\nmulti-frame inputs.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad\nknowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level\nperceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents\na significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it\nexhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific\nsegmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a\nunified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a\nstreamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the\nsegmentation paradigm from \\textit{segment anything} to \\textit{any\nsegmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that\nenables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.\nFurthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)\nsegmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual\nprompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative\ncapabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present\na unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.\nExperimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its\nefficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

        "title": "Super Resolved Imaging with Adaptive Optics",
        "summary": "Astronomical telescopes suffer from a tradeoff between field of view (FoV)\nand image resolution: increasing the FoV leads to an optical field that is\nunder-sampled by the science camera. This work presents a novel computational\nimaging approach to overcome this tradeoff by leveraging the existing adaptive\noptics (AO) systems in modern ground-based telescopes. Our key idea is to use\nthe AO system's deformable mirror to apply a series of learned, precisely\ncontrolled distortions to the optical wavefront, producing a sequence of images\nthat exhibit distinct, high-frequency, sub-pixel shifts. These images can then\nbe jointly upsampled to yield the final super-resolved image. Crucially, we\nshow this can be done while simultaneously maintaining the core AO\noperation--correcting for the unknown and rapidly changing wavefront\ndistortions caused by Earth's atmosphere. To achieve this, we incorporate\nend-to-end optimization of both the induced mirror distortions and the\nupsampling algorithm, such that telescope-specific optics and temporal\nstatistics of atmospheric wavefront distortions are accounted for. Our\nexperimental results with a hardware prototype, as well as simulations,\ndemonstrate significant SNR improvements of up to 12 dB over non-AO\nsuper-resolution baselines, using only existing telescope optics and no\nhardware modifications. Moreover, by using a precise bench-top replica of a\ncomplete telescope and AO system, we show that our methodology can be readily\ntransferred to an operational telescope.

        "summary": "As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal\ncapabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from\nthe hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual\ninput. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of\ntraining data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which\nconsists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs\nwith certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we\nfind that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage\ntheir training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during\ntraining. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often\nincorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand\nthis issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,\nrevealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling\n(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and\nlightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via\ntraining bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between\nground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias\nand adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only\nupdates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\\%\nof the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both\ndiscriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong\nscalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data\nvolume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond\nobject-level hallucination.

Current\ndeep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation\nmatrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth\nalignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the\nanatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular\ndistribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric\nconstraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new\nautomatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by\ndiffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main\ncomponents: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a\ndiffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).\nGeometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level\nalignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of\ntransformation matrices from clinical data.

        "title": "One Model For All: Partial Diffusion for Unified Try-On and Try-Off in Any Pose",
        "summary": "Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in\nimage-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment\nsynthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance\non exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability\nto handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality\nin real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments\nworn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically\nrestricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textbf{OMFA} (\\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for\nboth virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition\ngarments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing\ngarments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target\nperson (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel\nposes-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built\nupon a novel \\emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise\nand denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,\nthe person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient\nbidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely\nmask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,\nmaking it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging\nSMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose\ntry-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA\nachieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a\npractical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis.

        "summary": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) represents the most prevalent type of cardiac\narrhythmia for which treatment may require patients to undergo ablation\ntherapy. In this surgery cardiac tissues are locally scarred on purpose to\nprevent electrical signals from causing arrhythmia. Patient-specific cardiac\ndigital twin models show great potential for personalized ablation therapy,\nhowever, they demand accurate semantic segmentation of healthy and scarred\ntissue typically obtained from late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) magnetic\nresonance (MR) scans. In this work we propose the Left Atrial Cascading\nRefinement CNN (LA-CaRe-CNN), which aims to accurately segment the left atrium\nas well as left atrial scar tissue from LGE MR scans. LA-CaRe-CNN is a 2-stage\nCNN cascade that is trained end-to-end in 3D, where Stage 1 generates a\nprediction for the left atrium, which is then refined in Stage 2 in conjunction\nwith the original image information to obtain a prediction for the left atrial\nscar tissue. To account for domain shift towards domains unknown during\ntraining, we employ strong intensity and spatial augmentation to increase the\ndiversity of the training dataset. Our proposed method based on a 5-fold\nensemble achieves great segmentation results, namely, 89.21% DSC and 1.6969 mm\nASSD for the left atrium, as well as 64.59% DSC and 91.80% G-DSC for the more\nchallenging left atrial scar tissue. Thus, segmentations obtained through\nLA-CaRe-CNN show great potential for the generation of patient-specific cardiac\ndigital twin models and downstream tasks like personalized targeted ablation\ntherapy to treat AF.",

Existing\nworks predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment\ndressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their\ncomplementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way\nGarment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified\nframework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously\nresolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional\nfeature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned\nguidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly\nbridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask\ndependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a\nphased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the\nDressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of\nour proposed approach.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),\nwhich requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within\na video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the\nmodel to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are\nstreaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient\nto store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to\nstore recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating\nwhether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target\nevent. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain\nlong-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an\nevent-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals\nthat model event-level information with various durations. To preserve\nhistorically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event\nmemory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent\nand long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further\npropose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will\noccur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event.

        "summary": "Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a\nchallenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid\nmotion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and\nanimating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the\nlimitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition\nstrategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This\ndesign reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation\ncomplexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry\nrecovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth\nsimulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues\nand geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth\nimproves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to\nexisting methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also\nsupports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its\nversatility and practical utility.",

However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource\nconsumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and\ndeployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR\nmodel. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal\ncharacteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we\npropose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a\nspatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the\ncalibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each\nlayer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the\nlow-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine\nthe FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,\nwe propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased\nquantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model\nand significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods.

        "summary": "Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from\ngenerating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target\nconcepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate\nthis task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with\nsemantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update\nthe model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue\nthat existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in\nincomplete erasure due to \"non-zero alignment residual\", especially when text\nprompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality\ndegradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is\ndesigned for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall\ngenerative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict\nzero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect\nalignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete\nerasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that\ngradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from\nshallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes\ndiminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving\ngenerative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks\n(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the\neffectiveness of our ErasePro.",

        "summary": "Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such\nas 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D\ncontent in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that\ndirectly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross\nview/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse\nmulti-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and\neffectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first\npredicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and\ntemporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware\nspatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse\nstructural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular\nvideo to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,\nexplicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,\nenabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D\nobject dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16\nvideos with 21 frames for each object.

In this work, we\ninvestigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification.

In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on\nmultiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen\ntumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt\nthe models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We\ncompare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision\nTransformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models\nprovide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,\nreaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of\ntraining data.

        "summary": "In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer\narchitecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For\nMultitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary\ncompared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the\nlimits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware\nlimitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix\nscales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers\nof queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable\nInter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more\nefficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different\ntasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we\ndemonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference\nlatency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to\n7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.",

        "summary": "Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment target objects\nin audible videos based on given reference expressions. Prior works typically\nrely on learning latent embeddings via multimodal fusion to prompt a tunable\nSAM/SAM2 decoder for segmentation, which requires strong pixel-level\nsupervision and lacks interpretability. From a novel perspective of explicit\nreference understanding, we propose TGS-Agent, which decomposes the task into a\nThink-Ground-Segment process, mimicking the human reasoning procedure by first\nidentifying the referred object through multimodal analysis, followed by\ncoarse-grained grounding and precise segmentation. To this end, we first\npropose Ref-Thinker, a multimodal language model capable of reasoning over\ntextual, visual, and auditory cues. We construct an instruction-tuning dataset\nwith explicit object-aware think-answer chains for Ref-Thinker fine-tuning. The\nobject description inferred by Ref-Thinker is used as an explicit prompt for\nGrounding-DINO and SAM2, which perform grounding and segmentation without\nrelying on pixel-level supervision.

While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought\n(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal\ninteraction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or\nreasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence\nvia Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning\nframework.

Early-phase\nrenovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of\nDetail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows.

This paper\npresents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that\ngenerates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both\ncomputer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on\nsegmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the\northographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing\nperspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)\nand dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources.

In this paper, we introduce\nthe Chain of Questions (CoQ) framework, a curiosity-driven reasoning approach\nthat encourages multimodal language models to dynamically generate targeted\nquestions regarding their surroundings. These generated questions guide the\nmodel to selectively activate relevant modalities, thereby gathering critical\ninformation necessary for accurate reasoning and response generation. We\nevaluate our framework on a novel multimodal benchmark dataset, assembled by\nintegrating WebGPT, ScienceQA, AVSD, and ScanQA datasets.

We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of\nflow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:\nsparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the\nvarying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in\ninefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,\nwe introduce \\textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO\nframework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in\nflow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a\ntrajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating\nstochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit\nassignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a\nnoise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to\nthe intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning\nduring high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later\nphases.

To tackle this task, most existing VMR methods\nsolely focus on the visual and textual modalities while neglecting the\ncomplementary but important audio modality. Although a few recent works try to\ntackle the joint audio-vision-text reasoning, they treat all modalities equally\nand simply embed them without fine-grained interaction for moment retrieval.\nThese designs are counter-practical as: Not all audios are helpful for video\nmoment retrieval, and the audio of some videos may be complete noise or\nbackground sound that is meaningless to the moment determination. To this end,\nwe propose a novel Importance-aware Multi-Granularity fusion model (IMG), which\nlearns to dynamically and selectively aggregate the audio-vision-text contexts\nfor VMR. Specifically, after integrating the textual guidance with vision and\naudio separately, we first design a pseudo-label-supervised audio importance\npredictor that predicts the importance score of the audio, and accordingly\nassigns weights to mitigate the interference caused by noisy audio. Then, we\ndesign a multi-granularity audio fusion module that adaptively fuses audio and\nvisual modalities at local-, event-, and global-level, fully capturing their\ncomplementary contexts. We further propose a cross-modal knowledge distillation\nstrategy to address the challenge of missing audio modality during inference.\nTo evaluate our method, we further construct a new VMR dataset, i.e.,\nCharades-AudioMatter, where audio-related samples are manually selected and\nre-organized from the original Charades-STA to validate the model's capability\nin utilizing audio modality. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness\nof our method, achieving state-of-the-art with audio-video fusion in VMR\nmethods. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuiGuanLab/IMG.",

        "summary": "The primate visual cortex exhibits topographic organization, where\nfunctionally similar neurons are spatially clustered, a structure widely\nbelieved to enhance neural processing efficiency. While prior works have\ndemonstrated that conventional deep ANNs can develop topographic\nrepresentations, these models largely neglect crucial temporal dynamics. This\noversight often leads to significant performance degradation in tasks like\nobject recognition and compromises their biological fidelity. To address this,\nwe leverage spiking neural networks (SNNs), which inherently capture\nspike-based temporal dynamics and offer enhanced biological plausibility. We\npropose a novel Spatio-Temporal Constraints (STC) loss function for topographic\ndeep spiking neural networks (TDSNNs), successfully replicating the\nhierarchical spatial functional organization observed in the primate visual\ncortex from low-level sensory input to high-level abstract representations. Our\nresults show that STC effectively generates representative topographic features\nacross simulated visual cortical areas. While introducing topography typically\nleads to significant performance degradation in ANNs, our spiking architecture\nexhibits a remarkably small performance drop (No drop in ImageNet top-1\naccuracy, compared to a 3\\% drop observed in TopoNet, which is the\nbest-performing topographic ANN so far) and outperforms topographic ANNs in\nbrain-likeness. We also reveal that topographic organization facilitates\nefficient and stable temporal information processing via the spike mechanism in\nTDSNNs, contributing to model robustness. These findings suggest that TDSNNs\noffer a compelling balance between computational performance and brain-like\nfeatures, providing not only a framework for interpreting neural science\nphenomena but also novel insights for designing more efficient and robust deep\nlearning models.",

Despite these\nbenefits, the integration of AI into social behavior research also poses\nseveral challenges. Here we discuss the main steps involved and the tools\navailable for analyzing rodent social behavior, examining their advantages and\nlimitations.

        "summary": "Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and\nmotion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd\ntrajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and\nuncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown\npromising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for\ntrajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly\nincorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit\nthe interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we\npropose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that\nincorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The\nmotion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and\na pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to\neffectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient\nguidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable\ntrajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human\ntrajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against\nstate-of-the-art methods.

However, training samples easily contain\nprivate information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,\npotentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.\nAn intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content\nand retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant\ncomputational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning\nhas emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by\nselectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while\npreserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no\navailable datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection\nin biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark\nMultimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built\nupon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic\nprivate data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets\ntwo key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is\nmistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally\nrespond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where\nwrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,\nleading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning\nEfficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance\nacross different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med\nand find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful\nknowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.\nThis work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising\nfield.",

This capability has\nenabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to\nsegmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational\nburdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,\nand rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these\nlimitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that\nfuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our\napproach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a\nBackground Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and\nan Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in\nthe BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background\nfeature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages\nsaliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse\ndatasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under\nvarious imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and\nnumerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical\nstrengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new\nbaseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation.

In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video\nrestoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video\ndistortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,\nGAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space\nto restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts\nintra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance\nof audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,\nthe reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to\ngenerate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN\noutperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression\nartifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution.

Recent works\nmostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance\ngain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with\nthis, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that\nreformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the\nCategory-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the\nopen-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a\nstructured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features\ndistinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought\nprompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and\nenhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each\nimage into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature\nrepresentation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot\nsamples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and\ntext encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by\nretrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad\ncompatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization\nand adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios.

Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the\ncoarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in\nisolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold\nvital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of\ncomplementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing\na Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates\nboth low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through\nDetail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM\nrespectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and\nsemantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from\nsingle-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also\nequipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively\nassigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on\ntheir uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that\ntypifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks\ncaptured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate\nthat DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical\nimage analysis.",

        "summary": "Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as\nsecurity screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep\nlearning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,\ntheir effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and\ndiverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on\nsingle-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation\ncaused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025\nMultimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate\ncross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants\nare required to develop models that not only perform well within individual\ndomains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By\nleveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge\nencourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit\ndeceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of\nmore adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection\nsystems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning.

To address the trade-off between performance\nand cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully\nexploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder\nwithout introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a\ndetail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully\nintegrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature\noutput by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a\nlight-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally\nleverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic\nfeatures from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction.

While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong\ngeneralization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging\nanalysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge\nthis gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction\ntechniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single\nmodality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality\nmisalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this\npaper, we propose \\textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\\underline{N}teracted qu\\underline{E}ry\n\\underline{A}daptation with o\\underline{R}thogona\\underline{L} Regularization),\na novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two\ncontributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which\ndynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between\nmodalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal\nmedical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA\nintroduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from\nUSEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the\nincremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference\nof incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new\ninformation, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing\nthe capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in\na parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \\textbf{1.46M} learnable\nparameters.",

Despite recent\nprogress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view\nconditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on\nnon-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures\nand is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional\nsmoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade\nessential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of\nreconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware\nregularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a\nhierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces\nmulti-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity\nand robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we\ndesign an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from\nCanny edge detection.

Our extensive\nevaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a\nsignificant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,\ncannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process.

        "summary": "Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.\nHowever, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep\nlearning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent\nglobal dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated\nremarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to\ntheir ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of\nTransformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.\nHowever, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the\nreliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose\nGPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable\nInterpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the\nperspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.\nThe global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable\nparameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable\nattention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm\nof SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer\nspecifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches\nin k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.",

The framework centers around the Dense Object\nMatcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects.

DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense\nmatching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,\nexplicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching\namong objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed\nto improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the\ncomplete DOMR framework.

We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation\nthat decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase\nsynthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion\nlexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D\nmesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact\nrepresentation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous\nmotion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into\ntemporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural\nrendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior\nwork constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a\nfirst-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable\n\"choreography layer\" that can be visually realized through different human\nappearances.

To tackle these challenges, we\nintroduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative\npseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor\nsegmentation in CT scans.

However, existing\nbenchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and\nincomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world\nscenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first\ncomprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world\nhuman-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically\ndiverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential\nreasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6\nwell-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended\ncounting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction\npipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task\nselection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large\nmultimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification\nensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations\nof various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in\nstatic spatial tasks.

However, its application to the downstream Image-Text\nRetrieval (ITR) task is more challenging.

To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning\nwith Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning\nframework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically\nadjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the\nperformance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,\nDCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained\nrepresentation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it\ndynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image\nmutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces\nnegative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to\nlearn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the\nFine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging\nbenchmark for ITR in downstream data domains.

To mitigate\nthis, we introduce \\textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which\nconstructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and\nquantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning\nchallenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.\nBased on this observation, we propose \\textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token\nDistillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize\ntokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6\nquantization, $\\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering\n$3.9\\times$ model compression and $1.3\\times$ inference acceleration.

Specifically, our Slice-Block\nShuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across\nvolumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes\nperpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided\nDisplacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each\nslice, amplifying signals from difficult areas.

        "summary": "In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image\ndetection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG\nmethods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation\nmodels, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge\nunderexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with\ngeneralization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and\nmodel-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID\ndynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach\nutilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with\ncategory-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further\nintegrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the\nquery, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID\ngenerates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images\nfrom a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched\ninput for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the\nUniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that\nRAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.\nRAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining\nhigh accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG\ncompression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under\ndegradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model\nC2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG\ncompression scenarios.

        "summary": "Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality\nof images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues\ncaused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,\nblurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ\nmulti-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction\nquality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not\nnecessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our\nexperiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or\nsurpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing\ncomplexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in\nunderwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition\nNetwork (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition\nmechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation\nlayer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes\nmedium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature\nextraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through\ntwo core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing\ndual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and\nadaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block\n(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature\nmining and fusion.

Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and\nvisual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences\nor depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we\nfirst integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach\nis hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further\ninvestigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this\nproblem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using\n3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction\nmodule to directly infer camera pose from optical flow.

        "summary": "Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface\nshapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and\nilluminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom\nsettings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and\nilluminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination\nscenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose\nRotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural\nlight, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light\nconsistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the\nunknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate\ndata priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo\nmethods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape\nand reflectance recovery.

        "summary": "Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment\nnovel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent\nadvancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained\nVision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct\nFine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,\nremains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a\nperformance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex\nmitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is\nflawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two\nstandard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using\ntwo representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed\nprobing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly\nunderestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under\nDFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further\ninvestigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting\nprimarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than\nfrom degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we\npropose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates\nstrategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned\nclassifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive\nexperiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior\nperformance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring\nsubstantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.",

        "summary": "Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into\none seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations\nand the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the\nrelative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most\nexisting stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax\neffectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image\nstitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on\nthe novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry\ngrounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene\nreconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto\na designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving\npixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to\nfurther address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial\nstitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the\nrefined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large\nparallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric\nintegrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct\napplicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for\nimages with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods\nqualitatively and quantitatively.",

We propose\na comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic\ninnovations.

To\naddress these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided\nJoint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce\na Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous\nguidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors\nand thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference\nspeed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain\ncharacteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into\na single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint\nFourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing\nparameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance\nFramework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency\nbranches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain\nlow-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially\nreduce computational complexity.

For a\ncertain gradient type, the isochromats in the group can be easily chosen for\nensuring that they behave the same. For example, the group can be defined as\nthe isochromats whose locations along x-axis, T1, T2 and magnetic field\ninhomogeneity values are the same values. In such groups, simulations can be\ncombined when a pulse sequence with the magnetic field gradient along x-axis\nonly are processed.

        "summary": "In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical\nimages, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual\ndescriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural\ngrounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,\ncompositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual\npatterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale\ndomain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational\nresources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Knowledge to Sight\n(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by\ndecomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as\nshape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from\ndomain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which\nguide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level\nsupervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial\nstructure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact\nmodels with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\\% of the data required by\nstate-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training\ndata, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical\nVLMs, with up to 9.82\\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$.

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant\nprogress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when\nprocessing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'\ncontext limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before\nfeeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform\nsampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained\nby the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,\nbuilding a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised\nand non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these\nproblems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing\nMLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.\nSpecifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which\ncaptures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe\nselection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which\nmodels keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making\nprocess, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient\nrule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long\nvideo training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and\nvideo Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering\naccuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal\nsampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding\nbenchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge\nVideo-MLLMs.",

Existing representations in robotics and\ncomputer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural\nregularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made\nenvironments. This paper introduces \\textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal\nrepresentation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly\naccommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to\ndecouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared\nvanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled\nnormal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding\nof structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation\nreduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally\nembedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this\nparameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction\nalignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based\nbundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate\npose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter\ndimensionality and improving convergence stability.",

Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and\nreinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited\ngeneralization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for\nenhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and\nreasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset\ndependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates\ngrounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object\nlocalization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then\nbuilds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning\naccuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning\npath to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought\n(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby\nreducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.\nFinally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates\nanswer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess\nwhether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our\nexperiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves\nperformance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP\nimproves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by\n4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in\nenhancing reasoning reliability.",

        "summary": "The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and\nsocietal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media\nplaying a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used\nmode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful\ncontent. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of\ndataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To\naddress this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset\nof 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary\nclassification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic\nmemes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is\nthat it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,\nenhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation\nmodule that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes\noften do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these\ntags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection\ntasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved\ncontent moderation in multimodal online environments.",

        "summary": "In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress\nin medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture\nlong-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major\nlimitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with\nthe input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla\nTransformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'\nability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features\ncritical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose\nan efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed\nTCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention\n(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention\nto dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This\nis achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,\nsignificantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's\nability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a\nDual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the\nstandard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,\nthereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct\nextensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation\ndatasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation\nperformance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer\nachieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nmethods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an\noptimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.",

        "summary": "In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete\nground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task\nis severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and\nhigh inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete\nsegmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class\nrepresentations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging\nclass-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations\nand a neglect of target structural information.\n  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network\n(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete\nground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its\nvariant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key\nmodules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures\nsemantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract\nunbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure\nCoordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,\nstructure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic\ncognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the\nsemantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.\nFinally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic\nstep-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between\nclasses.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.

Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that\nrepresent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac\nmorphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be\nused to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.\nelectrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though\ndeep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great\nadvancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain\nshift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data\ndistributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known\nat training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that\nutilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.\nFurther, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at\ntest-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques\nto greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart\nsegmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the\nbest performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best\nperformance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT.

        "title": "Learning Robust Intervention Representations with Delta Embeddings",
        "summary": "Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest\nduring the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and\nrobustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the\nproperty that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the\nintervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.\nWhile most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the\nvariables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on\nrepresentations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an\neffective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to\nfocus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,\nwe propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding\nthat is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal\nvariables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is\ncapable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any\nadditional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate\nthat Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,\nsignificantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world\nbenchmarks.",

        "summary": "Image registration is a fundamental technique in the analysis of longitudinal\nand multi-phase CT images within clinical practice. However, most existing\nmethods are tailored for single-organ applications, limiting their\ngeneralizability to other anatomical regions. This work presents\nTotalRegistrator, an image registration framework capable of aligning multiple\nanatomical regions simultaneously using a standard UNet architecture and a\nnovel field decomposition strategy. The model is lightweight, requiring only\n11GB of GPU memory for training. To train and evaluate our method, we\nconstructed a large-scale longitudinal dataset comprising 695 whole-body\n(thorax-abdomen-pelvic) paired CT scans from individual patients acquired at\ndifferent time points. We benchmarked TotalRegistrator against a generic\nclassical iterative algorithm and a recent foundation model for image\nregistration. To further assess robustness and generalizability, we evaluated\nour model on three external datasets: the public thoracic and abdominal\ndatasets from the Learn2Reg challenge, and a private multiphase abdominal\ndataset from a collaborating hospital. Experimental results on the in-house\ndataset show that the proposed approach generally surpasses baseline methods in\nmulti-organ abdominal registration, with a slight drop in lung alignment\nperformance. On out-of-distribution datasets, it achieved competitive results\ncompared to leading single-organ models, despite not being fine-tuned for those\ntasks, demonstrating strong generalizability.

        "summary": "Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity\nrecognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of\nannotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods\ntypically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,\nrestricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative\nrepresentations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,\nProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity\nusing a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a\nclass-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes\nidentity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural\nNetwork (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and\nprototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To\nfurther enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph\nprototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing\nintra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.\nAdditionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global\nclassification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the\nembedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets\ndemonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1\nidentification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as\n0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited\ndata conditions.",

        "summary": "Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications\nacross various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to\nheterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial\nintelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a\nshortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes\na foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,\nnamed MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,\nencompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter\nsecurity, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset\nsignals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a\nself-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of\nDAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition\ntasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes\nonly a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the\nTransformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super\nplatform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The\nVPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%\nof parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)\nmethod by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits\nrobust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,\nefficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach\noffers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal\nrecognition models in the DAS domain.",

Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially\nSegment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired\nnew research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be\ndirectly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its\ntext-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the\nmask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its\nutility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core\ncomponents: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a\ncontext sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models\nthe spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a\nstructured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.\nMeanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying\nand leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing\nrich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a\nnew large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named\nVehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations\nacross diverse scenes and viewpoints.

One vital component often found in such document processing\nworkflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,\nremains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain\nthe decisions of document image classification models through\nfeature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail\nto provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this\npaper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document\ncounterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's\ndecision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose\nDocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination\nwith classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual\ncounterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise\nrefinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target\nfactual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a\nrigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document\nclassification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3\ndifferent models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established\nevaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism.

We evaluate our method across five widely\nused object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small\nlitter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,\na key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of\nencoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the\ndetection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both\nwithin-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset\nevaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate\nconsistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only\nbolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well\nto other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved\nwithout increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring\ncomputational efficiency and scalability.

        "summary": "Motion sensor time-series are central to human activity recognition (HAR),\nwith applications in health, sports, and smart devices. However, existing\nmethods are trained for fixed activity sets and require costly retraining when\nnew behaviours or sensor setups appear. Recent attempts to use large language\nmodels (LLMs) for HAR, typically by converting signals into text or images,\nsuffer from limited accuracy and lack verifiable interpretability. We propose\nZARA, the first agent-based framework for zero-shot, explainable HAR directly\nfrom raw motion time-series. ZARA integrates an automatically derived pair-wise\nfeature knowledge base that captures discriminative statistics for every\nactivity pair, a multi-sensor retrieval module that surfaces relevant evidence,\nand a hierarchical agent pipeline that guides the LLM to iteratively select\nfeatures, draw on this evidence, and produce both activity predictions and\nnatural-language explanations. ZARA enables flexible and interpretable HAR\nwithout any fine-tuning or task-specific classifiers. Extensive experiments on\n8 HAR benchmarks show that ZARA achieves SOTA zero-shot performance, delivering\nclear reasoning while exceeding the strongest baselines by 2.53x in macro F1.\nAblation studies further confirm the necessity of each module, marking ZARA as\na promising step toward trustworthy, plug-and-play motion time-series analysis.\nOur codes are available at https://github.com/zechenli03/ZARA.",

        "summary": "Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and\nComputer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically\nsensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),\nnoisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform\nscales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local\noptima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud\nregistration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including\nsimilarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and\ndefective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity\nbetween point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),\n\\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require\npoint-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be\nregarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in\nthe Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the\ntransformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned\ninfluences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training\nand complex feature encoding.

        "summary": "The underspecification of progressive levels of difficulty in measurement\nconstructs design and assessment tests for data visualization literacy may\nhinder the expressivity of measurements in both test design and test reuse. To\nmitigate this problem, this paper proposes DRIVE-T (Discriminating and\nRepresentative Items for Validating Expressive Tests), a methodology designed\nto drive the construction and evaluation of assessment items. Given a data\nvizualization, DRIVE-T supports the identification of task-based items\ndiscriminability and representativeness for measuring levels of data\nvisualization literacy. DRIVE-T consists of three steps: (1) tagging task-based\nitems associated with a set of data vizualizations; (2) rating them by\nindependent raters for their difficulty; (3) analysing raters' raw scores\nthrough a Many-Facet Rasch Measurement model. In this way, we can observe the\nemergence of difficulty levels of the measurement construct, derived from the\ndiscriminability and representativeness of task-based items for each data\nvizualization, ordered into Many-Facets construct levels. In this study, we\nshow and apply each step of the methodology to an item bank, which models the\ndifficulty levels of a measurement construct approximating a latent construct\nfor data visualization literacy. This measurement construct is drawn from\nsemiotics, i.e., based on the syntax, semantics and pragmatics knowledge that\neach data visualization may require to be mastered by people. The DRIVE-T\nmethodology operationalises an inductive approach, observable in a post-design\nphase of the items preparation, for formative-style and practice-based\nmeasurement construct emergence. A pilot study with items selected through the\napplication of DRIVE-T is also presented to test our approach.",

        "summary": "Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits\ndigitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods\noften treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading\nto a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent\nstudies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited\nscalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to\nfully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the\naforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly\nscalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a\nlearnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse\ntasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential\ntask interference, we devise a novel \\textbf{Prior \\textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet\ncomprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and\nglobal low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \\textbf{Prior\n\\textbf{F}usion \\textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively\nselect the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive\nexperiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable\nor even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and\nsimultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.",

Benefiting from the design of learnable\nqueries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the\nTSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned\nqueries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we\npropose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,\nleveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different\nqueries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,\nwe divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,\nmiddle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an\nadditional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries\nwith mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its\ndesignated function.

        "summary": "Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving\nscores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does\nnot fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for\ninterpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the\nvisualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual\nencodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA\nprovides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of\nsix visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color\nnominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find\nanomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value\nrelative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9\nstate-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across\nencodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to\nexpectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for\nmany task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart\nunderstanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning\ngaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.",

        "title": "How Does Bilateral Ear Symmetry Affect Deep Ear Features?",
        "summary": "Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to\nthe distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability\nof large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely\nadopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming\ntraditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry\non the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent\nstudies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences\nthe effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop\nan ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or\nright. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during\nboth training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five\ndatasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately\nduring training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.\nFurthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and\nvarious hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training\nCNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher\nverification rates.",

With the evolution\nof (multi-modal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to\nreality, as (M)LLM-based Agents using computing devices (e.g., computers and\nmobile phones) by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g.,\nGraphical User Interface (GUI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate\ntasks have significantly advanced. This paper presents a comprehensive survey\nof these advanced agents, designated as OS Agents. We begin by elucidating the\nfundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the\nenvironment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential\ncapabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. We then examine\nmethodologies for constructing OS Agents, focusing on domain-specific\nfoundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation\nprotocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse\ntasks. Finally, we discuss current challenges and identify promising directions\nfor future research, including safety and privacy, personalization and\nself-evolution. This survey aims to consolidate the state of OS Agents\nresearch, providing insights to guide both academic inquiry and industrial\ndevelopment.

        "summary": "In remote sensing, most segmentation networks adopt the UNet architecture,\noften incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance\nglobal-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these\nenhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the\nglobal contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a\nsimple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition\noperations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global\ncontext) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across\ndecoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn\nspatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local\ninformation in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder\n(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves\ncompetitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\\%\non ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\\% on LoveDA, while\nmaintaining high computational efficiency.

        "title": "Radar-Based NLoS Pedestrian Localization for Darting-Out Scenarios Near Parked Vehicles with Camera-Assisted Point Cloud Interpretation",
        "summary": "The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside\nparking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,\nparticularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology\nleverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent\nstudies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.\nHowever, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial\ninformation or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their\ngeneralizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in\nscenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as\nthese parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since\nparked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information\nobtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately\nreflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.\nTo address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization\nframework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud\n(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image\nsegmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and\nsubsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise\nspatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road\nenvironments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian\ndetection and contributes to improved road safety.

        "summary": "Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task\nwith significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is\nchallenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the\nvariability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in\ninferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,\nreproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art\nmethods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance\nof deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We\nfine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large\npublic datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against\nbaseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method\npre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world\nfood plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using\nMean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals\nthat models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained\non public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO\ndataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific\nregression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides\nquantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset\ncharacteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for\neffective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.",
