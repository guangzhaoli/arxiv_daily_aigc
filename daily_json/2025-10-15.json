        "summary": "Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description\ntask, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and\nhandling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models\npresent a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various\napplications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes\nCapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for\nthe first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to\nachieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%\nreduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce\nhigh-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain\na generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable\ncaptioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier\nmultimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and\nMetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and\ncost-effective visual captioning solution.",

Unlike traditional methods that typically only\nenable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides\nan interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene\nmotion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties\nof scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to\nenable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our\napproach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model\nsurpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly\nout-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant\nimprovements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.\nAdditionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our\nmethod to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part\nsegmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.\nCode and models are publicly available at\nhttps://compvis.github.io/flow-poke-transformer.",

        "summary": "Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally\nunder-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel\nviews. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,\nvanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether\nthey are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under\nocclusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue\nthat uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views\nand time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited\nvisibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a\nnovel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates\nreliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to\nestimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a\nspatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on\ndiverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty\nconsistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable\ngeometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.",

In this regard, the\nknowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,\nwhich transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model\n(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD\nmethods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual\nperception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely\noverlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify\nvisual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of\nthis issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD\nframework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of\nthe teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities.

While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing\ngeneration quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from\nunauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional\ndigital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the\ncomplex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve\nwatermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose\nImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our\nframework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the\noriginal dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through\nrandomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys.

        "summary": "Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a\npromising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face\ntwo major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on\nindividual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive\nframes. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt\nsparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome\nthese limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework\nfor long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from\ncoarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with\nprogressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and\ntemporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an\nagent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines\nvideo-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is\ngathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal\nunderstanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In\naddition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.\nEgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand\ncomplex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in\nextremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of\nVideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,\nachieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as\nGPT-4o.

        "summary": "One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype\nrepresentation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical\nvariability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on\ndeterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations\nthat fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.\nThis work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that\nreformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space\nexploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability\ndistributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically\ncoherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates\nthrough three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement\nmodule that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via\nforward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism\nthat leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,\nand (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while\nmaximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference\nconsistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both\nphases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final\nrepresentations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself\nacts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets\ndemonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new\nstate-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.",

Our approach leverages the observation\nthat the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more\nconservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and\nlater, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.\nThis adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent\nlearning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the\nmodel's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.\nExtensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves\nsignificant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,\noutperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also\nproviding a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion\nacceleration.",

However,\nVLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is\nsupervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their\nrepresentational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose\n\\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to\npredict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that\ncompels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.\nWe showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA\narchetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual\ntokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual\nfeatures. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we\nintroduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for\nreal-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a\n680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly\noutperforms BEV and VLA baselines.

Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use\nthe last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train\nlarge unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands\nsubstantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its\naccessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model\nconditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a\nunified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention\nPooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level\ndetails from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion\ngenerative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion\narchitectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of\nvisual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We\npropose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),\nwhich conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens\ngenerated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the\nalignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning\ncapabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference.

However, the conventional process for creating and\nanimating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,\nrequiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from\nprofessional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation\nmodels, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars\nfrom a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While\nthese techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer\ncompelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or\nan explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when\nrendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,\nwe build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital\nhumans based on a single reference image and target expressions.

        "summary": "Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models\n(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding\ncapabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where\na model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual\ngeneration. A model might correctly understand an image based on user\ninstructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.\nThis phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve\nself-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation\nmodule? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a\nself-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing\nUMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own\nunderstanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective\nsignals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional\nhuman-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a\nglobal-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity\nof images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \\textbf{global reward}\nensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a\n\\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads\nto powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance\non T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \\textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82\nto \\textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for\nenabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation\nvia self-rewarding.",

        "summary": "Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission\ntomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake\nquantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction\nare crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of\nneurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited\napplicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention\n(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.\nDL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET\nscans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate\nDL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,\n18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and\ngeneralization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and\nqualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free\nimages with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts\nthat are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest\nstandard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between\nDL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5\nplus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven\nPET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion\ncorrection accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings.

This paper proposes a novel framework, named\nSPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic\nSegmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into\nan iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive\nattention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via\nenrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically\nadjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy\nis integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation\nresults from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the\nconfidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the\ncamera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the\nlearning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is\nbeneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to\nsynthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive\nexperiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based\nfeature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the\nodometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.",

With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni\nLanguage Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in\nparallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer\nunderstanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe\nfine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a\nsystematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the\nperspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an\ninherent \"co-growth\" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To\naddress this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline\nintegrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally\nhallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,\nwe train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed\nperception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the\ncascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on\nMMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and\ndelivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed\ncaptioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and\nachieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the\nvideo-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni\ndetailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for\ndetailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,\nefficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality\ndetailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such\ndetailed captions.",

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in\nreal-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring\nactive image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover\nsalient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think\nwith images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with\nother tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as\npassive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.\nMost existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where\nimages are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,\nan Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability\nto perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under\nthe think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended\nvision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse\ndomains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our\nevaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective\nintegration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model\n(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent\ntool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image\nmanipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement.

        "summary": "Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations\nthat empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the\nevolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language\nmodels, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world\napplications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support,\nunstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we\nintroduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that\naddresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural\ndesign. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme\nto boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning.\nSpecifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the\nmodel's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched\ncross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement\ntraining further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios\nby distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while\nmining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic\nspecialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training\nflexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding\nachieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval\ntasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated\nwith our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a\ncrucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model\ndelivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.158% and the 14-day LT gain of +0.144% in the\nDouyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features\nproduced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.08% AUC gain.",

Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on\nmotion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static\nscenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to\nEO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral\ninputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages\ndependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural\ncodecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate\ntransformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on\nSentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x\nstronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT\nenables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the\nAllClear benchmark.

Nonetheless,\nexisting zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the\nassumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their\neffectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are\nmore complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for\nreal-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency\nConsistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy\nimage and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,\nimage textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across\ndifferent frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we\ndeveloped cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize\nimage denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate\nthat our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of\ncomputational efficiency and denoising performance.",

Prior studies have\nhighlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the\nrepresentations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on\nmodel intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize\nthis paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate\nrepresentations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies\nacross diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich\nrepresentations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the\nneed for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,\nplug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and\ngeneralizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no\npretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on\nimage generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as\naudio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the\ngeneration quality and the training efficiency.

Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent\ndynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human\nmotion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly\nimproves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over\nstate-of-the-art approaches.

In contrast, reinforcement learning\n(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such\nas sample inefficiency and unstable convergence.

Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL\npretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive\ndual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during\ntraining.

We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective\noptimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima\noften emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data\naugmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better\ngeneralisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a\nrange of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation\ntend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety\nmetrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than\nflatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can\nreflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),\ncalling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.",

We evaluate this approach in\nthe context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly\nemerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from\ninherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our\nframework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their\ncorresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without\nrequiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only\nachieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both\nin-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

The existing\nstate-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in\nindividual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and\naccuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To\novercome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient\nModeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework\nfor PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state\ndetection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,\nwhile the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to\nrecognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a\nspatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to\ncapture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal\nencoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is\nevaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay\nbetween actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,\nrespectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in\ndelay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on\nunobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps.

        "summary": "Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,\nthese improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity\nand expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,\nnot all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be\nintegrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a\nnondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation\ninto deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the\nGumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall\nshort in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.\nOnce the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust\nto different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this\nend, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even\nduring inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and\nreduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as\nwell as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them\nbeing a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical\nconditions.",

        "summary": "Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as\nautonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate\nmultimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for\ndownstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made\nsignificant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious\nchallenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually\ndesigned loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss\nfunctions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images\nconstructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.\nOn the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient\nmagnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based\nperception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At\nfirst, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network\nto learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained\nreference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge\nenhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer\ndetails and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we\nintroduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both\ngradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.\nAngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and\ncorrect edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and\nM3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream\nmethods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method\nproduces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating\nsuperior fusion capability.",

In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection\nmethod that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model\ntraining. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar\nbackground regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from\nID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the\nlocal invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the\n$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to\nalleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data.

A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse\nof the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion\nfrequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,\nthis work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent\ndynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the\nhierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale\nstructure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking\nerror, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,\nthe dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately\nleverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of\ninaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and\nobjects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture\nrepresentations across different visual objects in the video facilitates\ncontrollable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video\nreconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video\nprocessing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally\nconsistent video editing.",

A promising direction involves combining\nauto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,\nreducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting\nmultiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to\ntoken incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during\ntraining remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is\nno mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions.

However, the principles underlying the\nconstruction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly\nunderstood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and\nstudy their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling\ntraining and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and\nquestion pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore\nscaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our\nfindings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM\nperformance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions\nand the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)\nscaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs\nper image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated\nby these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT\nreasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs\ntrained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.\nFor instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA\nmodel and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.\nFurthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost\nby 73% without sacrificing accuracy.

        "summary": "Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer\nnew opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics\nand manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of\nexpertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.\nSuccess with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,\nwhich can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning\nis a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This\nwork investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object\ndetection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,\nspecifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined\nthe impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator\ntool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.\nIt comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,\nutilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our\nfindings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic\nimage data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of\nsynthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection\nmodels.",

We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report\ngeneration from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident\nframe detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models\n(VLMs).

        "summary": "Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video\nclassification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with\nlinear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data\nwhile maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to\ndownstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream\ntask adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the\nsequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and\ntemporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective\npropagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal\ninformation between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of\ndiscriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State\nSpace Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines\nintra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key\nspatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering\n(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each\nframe. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread\ndiscriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By\nadaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and\nbetween frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in\nvideos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark\ndatasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by\n2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.",

To this end,\nexisting advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of\nhistorical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by\nrestoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these\nmethods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new\nknowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,\nresulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a\nclass-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time\nadaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain\nknowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different\ndomains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically\naccumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming\ndata, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively\nseparate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,\nalleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are\ndistinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation\nand storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain\nKnowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new\nknowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy\nknowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of\nnew and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency.

        "summary": "Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained\ndiffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two\ncritical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,\nthey struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,\nlet alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to\nmitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe\nshape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we\nidentify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively\nexploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first\npropose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate\nmetric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and\nunobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance\nthroughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide\nnovel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with\nvideo diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.\nExtensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our\nmethod consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and\nappearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our\nmethod naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong\ngeneralizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world\napplicability.

        "summary": "Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer\nvision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and\ninterior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate\nroom layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial\ntransformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:\nFirst, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the\ninput images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS\ntransformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to\nwarp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted\nparameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room\nlayouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid\nlayouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons\nwith state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation\nand emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama\nimages. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room\nlayout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and\n91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,\nrespectively.

        "summary": "The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in\n3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision\n(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes\nsolving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the\nabsence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this\nill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an\nexplicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion\npriors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably\nintroduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which\nparametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera\nmotion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we\npropose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical\nflow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by\nmodeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an\nimplicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal\ncoherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion\npriors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth\nestimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our\nframework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via\nimplicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments\ndemonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even\nwith supervised approaches.",

        "summary": "Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos\nare pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.\nHowever, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with\nmuch more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on\nthe more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval\n(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the\ngiven query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills\ngeneralization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language\npre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR\nnetwork. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic\nKnowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides\nsupervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model\ncomprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable\nknowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific\ninformation from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps.

        "summary": "Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet\ncurrent methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.\nThis inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which\nallocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical\nobjects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive\nGaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic\npriorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS\nintroduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and\nRegularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to\naggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained\ndetails on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering\npipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull\noccluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive\nexperiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves\nexceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,\nwhile significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to\nover 350 FPS.",

To address the dual\nchallenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in\nISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning\nframework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned\nwith the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis.

In the second stage, we introduce\nReal-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise\ncharacteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library.

        "summary": "Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last\nless than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately\nrecognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in\npsychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression\nrecognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient\nnature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While\ndynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal\nmotion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the\ndistinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a\nmicro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel\ndual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one\nencoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset\nphase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,\nand a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate\nfeatures from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and\nMMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms\nconventional single-phase DI-based approaches.

        "summary": "Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate\nregression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although\nrecent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face\nchallenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate\nmisalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a\n3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On\nbenchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or\nexceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot\nsetting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use\nspecial tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the\nmodel's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate\nprediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate\nhigh-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically\nrich supervision for training; \\3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage\ntraining process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with\nGRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages\ngeometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous\ncoordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable\nbehaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature\nof the initial SFT stage.

To\nmitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more\nscalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce\nambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment\nchallenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks\nthrough training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.\nHowever, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and\ncomplexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance\nsegmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher\nmodel serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an\nExponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate\nprecise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement\nthat enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance\ncenters. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and\nmasked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between\npredictions and pseudo-masks.

        "summary": "With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),\nremarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning\n(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three\nconundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation\nshift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise\nsub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the\nDiscriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address\nthese challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet\nefficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)\nnetwork, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a\nlightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each\nincremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new\nclasses, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the\ncurrent model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a\nresult, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different\nincremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable\ncomparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the\nDecoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and\nnegative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This\ndecoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the\nfeature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between\nstage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across\nall classes.

        "summary": "Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code\ndeblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized\nby highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.\nYet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To\naddress this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which\nembeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we\ndevelop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that\nsignificantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly\nblurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for\nfast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive\nDual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on\ninput blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.\nExtensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed.

        "summary": "Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to\nsmall targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based\ntracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and\ntexture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.\nMultispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides\ncrucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial\nconditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has\nhindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the\nfirst challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object\ntracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video\nsequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)\nComprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small\ntargets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and\n(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced\nambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and\nleverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and\norientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a\nlightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving\ncompatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for\nprecise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive\ntransformer.

We insert this continuous function as the middle\nlayer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a\ntri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend\nfor one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF\n(Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly\navailable data sets, validating the superior performance against the current\nstate-of-the-art.",

        "summary": "Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where\ninterpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in\ndiagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges\nto explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision\nTransformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and\nSwin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct\nboth quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:\nperipheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image\nclassification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers\nthe most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM\nconsistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,\nwhile Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in\nmisclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant\nmorphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model\ntransparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration\nof ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.",

To establish baselines across varying\ncomputational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by\nadapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging\nthe early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including\nSwin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is\nmotivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs\nproduce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of\nnon-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27\nhierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the\nfirst two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.\nMoreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs\nbetween accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight\nalternatives.",

Current techniques for\nphysically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face\nsignificant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes\nand simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can\ncompromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce\n\\our{} (\\textbf{G}aussian \\textbf{S}platting for \\textbf{V}irtual\n\\textbf{E}nvironment \\textbf{R}endering and \\textbf{S}cene \\textbf{E}diting), a\nnovel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an\nobject's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation.

This versatile architecture delivers\na highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D\nmanipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current\nstate-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study\ninvolving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is\nstatistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation\nand is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting\nand shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms\nthat our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing\nits potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.",

Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a\nsolution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression\nof photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited\nin-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected\nto real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a\nconstrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for\ncompressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly\noptimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that\nadheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our\ncoding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both\nbandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced\nin systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts\nto arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world\nsystem with a non-ideal impulse response function.",
