        "summary": "Text-to-Image (T2I) models have made remarkable progress in generating images\nfrom text prompts, but their output quality and safety still depend heavily on\nhow prompts are phrased. Existing safety methods typically refine prompts using\nlarge language models (LLMs), but they overlook the images produced, which can\nresult in unsafe outputs or unnecessary changes to already safe prompts. To\naddress this, we propose an iterative prompt refinement algorithm that uses\nVision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze both the input prompts and the\ngenerated images. By leveraging visual feedback, our method refines prompts\nmore effectively, improving safety while maintaining user intent and\nreliability comparable to existing LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we\nintroduce a new dataset labeled with both textual and visual safety signals\nusing off-the-shelf multi-modal LLM, enabling supervised fine-tuning.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our approach produces safer outputs\nwithout compromising alignment with user intent, offering a practical solution\nfor generating safer T2I content.

        "summary": "Understanding how spontaneous brain activity relates to stimulus-driven\nneural responses is a fundamental challenge in cognitive neuroscience. While\ntask-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) captures localized\nstimulus-evoked brain activation, its acquisition is costly, time-consuming,\nand difficult to scale across populations. In contrast, resting-state fMRI\n(rs-fMRI) is task-free and abundant, but lacks direct interpretability. We\nintroduce Rest2Visual, a conditional generative model that predicts visually\nevoked fMRI (ve-fMRI) from resting-state input and 2D visual stimuli. It\nfollows a volumetric encoder--decoder design, where multiscale 3D features from\nrs-fMRI are modulated by image embeddings via adaptive normalization, enabling\nspatially accurate, stimulus-specific activation synthesis. To enable model\ntraining, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset from the Natural Scenes\nDataset (NSD), aligning each rs-fMRI volume with stimulus images and their\ncorresponding ve-fMRI activation maps. Quantitative evaluation shows that the\npredicted activations closely match ground truth across standard similarity and\nrepresentational metrics, and support successful image reconstruction in\ndownstream decoding. Notably, the predicted maps preserve subject-specific\nstructure, demonstrating the model's capacity to generate individualized\nfunctional surrogates. Our results provide compelling evidence that\nindividualized spontaneous neural activity can be transformed into\nstimulus-aligned representations, opening new avenues for scalable, task-free\nfunctional brain modeling.",

We use spatially-aligned skeleton signals to replicate body\nmotion and implicit facial features extracted from source images to reenact\nexpressions, enabling the generation of character videos with high\ncontrollability and expressiveness. Furthermore, to enhance environmental\nintegration during character replacement, we develop an auxiliary Relighting\nLoRA.

Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy\nenhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to\nsubstantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain\ngaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to\naddress the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection\nfor BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with\ntheir multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric\nspaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain\nadaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware\nteacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a\nReliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model.\nSpecifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth\npredictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty\nestimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are\nessential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the\ndomain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric\nembedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two\ndomains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential\nMoving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts\ninformed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the\nsuperiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in\nfour cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D\nobject detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\\% NDS and 9.5\\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night\nadaptation.",

        "summary": "Imagine living in a world composed solely of primitive shapes, could you\nstill recognise familiar objects? Recent studies have shown that abstract\nimages-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic\ninformation to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from\nsuch images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster\nimages. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and\ninvestigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different\nabstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction\nImage Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images\ngenerated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then\ntrain and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks\nincluding classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a\ncomprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We\nalso discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective\nformat for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision\ntasks.",

We hope it better allows researchers to follow the\nstate-of-the-art in this very dynamic area. Meanwhile, a growing number of\ntestbeds have boosted the evolution of general-purpose large language models.\nThus, this year's MARS2 focuses on real-world and specialized scenarios to\nbroaden the multimodal reasoning applications of MLLMs. Our organizing team\nreleased two tailored datasets Lens and AdsQA as test sets, which support\ngeneral reasoning in 12 daily scenarios and domain-specific reasoning in\nadvertisement videos, respectively. We evaluated 40+ baselines that include\nboth generalist MLLMs and task-specific models, and opened up three competition\ntracks, i.e., Visual Grounding in Real-world Scenarios (VG-RS), Visual Question\nAnswering with Spatial Awareness (VQA-SA), and Visual Reasoning in Creative\nAdvertisement Videos (VR-Ads). Finally, 76 teams from the renowned academic and\nindustrial institutions have registered and 40+ valid submissions (out of\n1200+) have been included in our ranking lists. Our datasets, code sets (40+\nbaselines and 15+ participants' methods), and rankings are publicly available\non the MARS2 workshop website and our GitHub organization page\nhttps://github.com/mars2workshop/, where our updates and announcements of\nupcoming events will be continuously provided.",

        "summary": "Accurate histopathological diagnosis often requires multiple differently\nstained tissue sections, a process that is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and\nenvironmentally taxing due to the use of multiple chemical stains. Recently,\nvirtual staining has emerged as a promising alternative that is faster,\ntissue-conserving, and environmentally friendly. However, existing virtual\nstaining methods face significant challenges in clinical applications,\nprimarily due to their reliance on well-aligned paired data. Obtaining such\ndata is inherently difficult because chemical staining processes can distort\ntissue structures, and a single tissue section cannot undergo multiple staining\nprocedures without damage or loss of information. As a result, most available\nvirtual staining datasets are either unpaired or roughly paired, making it\ndifficult for existing methods to achieve accurate pixel-level supervision. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a robust virtual staining framework\nfeaturing cascaded registration mechanisms to resolve spatial mismatches\nbetween generated outputs and their corresponding ground truth. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels across five datasets, achieving an average improvement of 3.2% on\ninternal datasets and 10.1% on external datasets. Moreover, in datasets with\nsubstantial misalignment, our approach achieves a remarkable 23.8% improvement\nin peak signal-to-noise ratio compared to baseline models. The exceptional\nrobustness of the proposed method across diverse datasets simplifies the data\nacquisition process for virtual staining and offers new insights for advancing\nits development.",

        "summary": "Self-supervised learning through masked autoencoders has attracted great\nattention for remote sensing (RS) foundation model (FM) development, enabling\nimproved representation learning across diverse sensors and downstream tasks.\nHowever, existing RS FMs often either suffer from substantial computational\ncomplexity during both training and inference or exhibit limited\nrepresentational capacity. These issues restrict their practical applicability\nin RS. To address this limitation, we propose an adaptation for enhancing the\nefficiency of RS FMs by integrating the Soft mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism\ninto the FM. The integration of Soft MoEs into the FM allows modality-specific\nexpert specialization alongside shared cross-sensor representation learning. To\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptation, we apply it on the\nCross-Sensor Masked Autoencoder (CSMAE) model, resulting in the Cross-Sensor\nMixture-of-Experts (CSMoE) model. In addition, we introduce a thematic-climatic\ndescriptor-driven sampling strategy for the construction of a representative\nand diverse training set to train our CSMoE model. Extensive experiments on\nscene classification, semantic segmentation, and content-based image retrieval\ndemonstrate that our adaptation yields a reduction in computational\nrequirements while maintaining or improving representational performance.\nCompared to state-of-the-art RS FMs, CSMoE achieves a superior trade-off\nbetween representational capacity, accuracy, and computational efficiency. On\naverage, CSMoE achieves more than twice the computational efficiency of\nexisting RS FMs, while maintaining competitive performance across all\nexperiments. These results show the effectiveness of the proposed adaptation\nfor creating computationally efficient RS FMs. The code for the model, the\ntraining set creation, and the model weights will be available at\nhttps://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/csmoe.",

Therefore,\nadvancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video\nscenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the\nchallenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models,\nthis paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking\nframework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture\nthat leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic\ninformation from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to\nfurther enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce\nthe Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion\nModule (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic\ninformation to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the\nefficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the\neffectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality\nvideo scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing\nmethods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in\nconventional scenarios.",

As the successor to\nSAIL-VL, SAIL-VL2 achieves state-of-the-art performance at the 2B and 8B\nparameter scales across diverse image and video benchmarks, demonstrating\nstrong capabilities from fine-grained perception to complex reasoning. Three\ncore innovations drive its effectiveness. First, a large-scale data curation\npipeline with scoring and filtering strategies enhances both quality and\ndistribution across captioning, OCR, QA, and video data, improving training\nefficiency. Second, a progressive training framework begins with a powerful\npre-trained vision encoder (SAIL-ViT), advances through multimodal\npre-training, and culminates in a thinking-fusion SFT-RL hybrid paradigm that\nsystematically strengthens model capabilities. Third, architectural advances\nextend beyond dense LLMs to efficient sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) designs.\nWith these contributions, SAIL-VL2 demonstrates competitive performance across\n106 datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging reasoning\nbenchmarks such as MMMU and MathVista. Furthermore, on the OpenCompass\nleaderboard, SAIL-VL2-2B ranks first among officially released open-source\nmodels under the 4B parameter scale, while serving as an efficient and\nextensible foundation for the open-source multimodal community.",

This paper proposes MAP (Map-Assisted Planning), a novel\nmap-assisted end-to-end trajectory planning framework. MAP explicitly\nintegrates segmentation-based map features and the current ego status through a\nPlan-enhancing Online Mapping module, an Ego-status-guided Planning module, and\na Weight Adapter based on current ego status. Experiments conducted on the\nDAIR-V2X-seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 16.6%\nreduction in L2 displacement error, a 56.2% reduction in off-road rate, and a\n44.5% improvement in overall score compared to the UniV2X baseline, even\nwithout post-processing. Furthermore, it achieves top ranking in Track 2 of the\nEnd-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge of MEIS\nWorkshop @CVPR2025, outperforming the second-best model by 39.5% in terms of\noverall score.

        "summary": "Diffusion models like Stable Diffusion have become prominent in visual\nsynthesis tasks due to their powerful customization capabilities, which also\nintroduce significant security risks, including deepfakes and copyright\ninfringement. In response, a class of methods known as protective perturbation\nemerged, which mitigates image misuse by injecting imperceptible adversarial\nnoise. However, purification can remove protective perturbations, thereby\nexposing images again to the risk of malicious forgery. In this work, we\nformalize the anti-purification task, highlighting challenges that hinder\nexisting approaches, and propose a simple diagnostic protective perturbation\nnamed AntiPure. AntiPure exposes vulnerabilities of purification within the\n\"purification-customization\" workflow, owing to two guidance mechanisms: 1)\nPatch-wise Frequency Guidance, which reduces the model's influence over\nhigh-frequency components in the purified image, and 2) Erroneous Timestep\nGuidance, which disrupts the model's denoising strategy across different\ntimesteps. With additional guidance, AntiPure embeds imperceptible\nperturbations that persist under representative purification settings,\nachieving effective post-customization distortion. Experiments show that, as a\nstress test for purification, AntiPure achieves minimal perceptual discrepancy\nand maximal distortion, outperforming other protective perturbation methods\nwithin the purification-customization workflow.",

        "summary": "Recent advancements in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have established them as\nthe state-of-the-art method for video generation. However, their inherently\nsequential denoising process results in inevitable latency, limiting real-world\napplicability. Existing acceleration methods either compromise visual quality\ndue to architectural modifications or fail to reuse intermediate features at\nproper granularity. Our analysis reveals that DiT blocks are the primary\ncontributors to inference latency. Across diffusion timesteps, the feature\nvariations of DiT blocks exhibit a U-shaped pattern with high similarity during\nintermediate timesteps, which suggests substantial computational redundancy. In\nthis paper, we propose Block-Wise Caching (BWCache), a training-free method to\naccelerate DiT-based video generation. BWCache dynamically caches and reuses\nfeatures from DiT blocks across diffusion timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce\na similarity indicator that triggers feature reuse only when the differences\nbetween block features at adjacent timesteps fall below a threshold, thereby\nminimizing redundant computations while maintaining visual fidelity. Extensive\nexperiments on several video diffusion models demonstrate that BWCache achieves\nup to 2.24$\\times$ speedup with comparable visual quality.",

Despite the remarkable progress made in classification-based\ndetection, accurately localizing forged areas remains a significant challenge.\nA common strategy is to incorporate forged region annotations during model\ntraining alongside manipulated images. However, such approaches often neglect\nthe complementary nature of local detail and global semantic context, resulting\nin suboptimal localization performance. Moreover, an often-overlooked aspect is\nthe fusion strategy between local and global predictions. Naively combining the\noutputs from both branches can amplify noise and errors, thereby undermining\nthe effectiveness of the localization.\n  To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that independently\npredicts manipulated regions using both local and global perspectives.

Although linearly interpolating the\nembedding vectors of different textual descriptions can guide the model to\ngenerate a sequence of images with varying colors, this approach lacks precise\ncontrol over the range of color changes in the output images. Moreover, the\nrelationship between the interpolation coefficient and the resulting image\ncolor is unknown and uncontrollable.

To address this challenge,\nprior approaches incorporate attention mechanisms for implicit cross-modal\nlocal alignment. However, they lack the ability to verify whether all local\nfeatures are correctly aligned. Moreover, existing methods primarily focus on\nhard negative samples during model updates, with the goal of refining\ndistinctions between positive and negative pairs, often neglecting incorrectly\nmatched positive pairs. To alleviate these issues, we propose FMFA, a\ncross-modal Full-Mode Fine-grained Alignment framework, which enhances global\nmatching through explicit fine-grained alignment and existing implicit\nrelational reasoning -- hence the term ``full-mode\" -- without requiring\nadditional supervision. Specifically, we design an Adaptive Similarity\nDistribution Matching (A-SDM) module to rectify unmatched positive sample\npairs. A-SDM adaptively pulls the unmatched positive pairs closer in the joint\nembedding space, thereby achieving more precise global alignment. Additionally,\nwe introduce an Explicit Fine-grained Alignment (EFA) module, which makes up\nfor the lack of verification capability of implicit relational reasoning. EFA\nstrengthens explicit cross-modal fine-grained interactions by sparsifying the\nsimilarity matrix and employs a hard coding method for local alignment.

To address this issue, we propose Triple Query\nFormer (TQF), which factorizes the referring query into three specialized\ncomponents: an appearance query for static attributes, an intra-frame\ninteraction query for spatial relations, and an inter-frame motion query for\ntemporal association. Instead of relying solely on textual embeddings, our\nqueries are dynamically constructed by integrating both linguistic cues and\nvisual guidance. Furthermore, we introduce two motion-aware aggregation modules\nthat enhance object token representations: Intra-frame Interaction Aggregation\nincorporates position-aware interactions among objects within a single frame,\nwhile Inter-frame Motion Aggregation leverages trajectory-guided alignment\nacross frames to ensure temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on multiple\nRVOS benchmarks demonstrate the advantages of TQF and the effectiveness of our\nstructured query design and motion-aware aggregation modules.",

        "summary": "The rapid advancement of generative models, particularly diffusion-based\napproaches, has inadvertently facilitated their potential for misuse. Such\nmodels enable malicious exploiters to replicate artistic styles that capture an\nartist's creative labor, personal vision, and years of dedication in an\ninexpensive manner. This has led to a rise in the need and exploration of\nmethods for protecting artworks against style mimicry. Although generic\ndiffusion models can easily mimic an artistic style, finetuning amplifies this\ncapability, enabling the model to internalize and reproduce the style with\nhigher fidelity and control. We hypothesize that certain cross-attention layers\nexhibit heightened sensitivity to artistic styles. Sensitivity is measured\nthrough activation strengths of attention layers in response to style and\ncontent representations, and assessing their correlations with features\nextracted from external models. Based on our findings, we introduce an\nefficient and lightweight protection strategy, StyleProtect, that achieves\neffective style defense against fine-tuned diffusion models by updating only\nselected cross-attention layers. Our experiments utilize a carefully curated\nartwork dataset based on WikiArt, comprising representative works from 30\nartists known for their distinctive and influential styles and cartoon\nanimations from the Anita dataset. The proposed method demonstrates promising\nperformance in safeguarding unique styles of artworks and anime from malicious\ndiffusion customization, while maintaining competitive imperceptibility.",

This clustering-based strategy provides an\nalternative to traditional outlier rejection schemes such as RANSAC, in which\ncandidates are validated by reprojection error across all data points. In this\npaper, CLAP is extended to a more general framework beyond 2D localization,\nspecifically to 3D localization and image stitching.

Although multimodal\nclassification approaches integrating information from several modalities\noutperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful\ncontent defines a video's category.

        "summary": "Diffusion models enable high-quality virtual try-on (VTO) with their\nestablished image synthesis abilities. Despite the extensive end-to-end\ntraining of large pre-trained models involved in current VTO methods,\nreal-world applications often prioritize limited training and inference,\nserving, and deployment budgets for VTO. To solve this obstacle, we apply\nDoob's h-transform efficient fine-tuning (DEFT) for adapting large pre-trained\nunconditional models for downstream image-conditioned VTO abilities. DEFT\nfreezes the pre-trained model's parameters and trains a small h-transform\nnetwork to learn a conditional h-transform. The h-transform network allows\ntraining only 1.42 percent of the frozen parameters, compared to a baseline of\n5.52 percent in traditional parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).\n  To further improve DEFT's performance and decrease existing models' inference\ntime, we additionally propose an adaptive consistency loss. Consistency\ntraining distills slow but high-performing diffusion models into a fast one\nwhile retaining performance by enforcing consistencies along the inference\npath. Inspired by constrained optimization, instead of distillation, we combine\nthe consistency loss and the denoising score matching loss in a data-adaptive\nmanner for fine-tuning existing VTO models at a low cost. Empirical results\nshow the proposed DEFT-VTON method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VTO\ntasks, with as few as 15 denoising steps, while maintaining competitive\nresults.",

In this work, we introduce \\texttt{LivePixel}, a Python-based graphical\nuser interface that integrates with imaging systems, such as webcams,\nmicroscopes, and others, to enable real-time image annotation. LivePyxel is\ndesigned to be easy to use through a simple interface that allows users to\nprecisely delimit areas for annotation using tools commonly found in commercial\ngraphics editing software.

We propose BiasMap, a\nmodel-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational\nbiases in stable diffusion models. BiasMap leverages cross-attention\nattribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics (e.g.,\ngender, race) and semantics (e.g., professions), going deeper into\nrepresentational bias during the image generation. Using attribution maps of\nthese concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics-semantics concept\nentanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that\nremains hidden in existing fairness discovery approaches. In addition, we\nfurther utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion\nsampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected\nSoftIoU during the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness\ninterventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to\ndisentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate\nconcept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional\nbias mitigation.",

Next, SRC searches for a\ndiverse set of candidate responses from the fine-tuned LVLMs for each sample,\nfollowed by a proposed pairwise scoring strategy using a tailored scoring\nmodel, R-Scorer, to evaluate both rationale quality and factual consistency of\ncandidates.

By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens,\nour approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene\ncomplexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of\ninformation, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to\nstrengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a\nsemantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside\nsuperpixels and global context outside.

        "summary": "Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of\nautonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably\nface distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where\nrare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD)\ncases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on\ncomputer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation,\ntrajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study\nformulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing\nformal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms\n[1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces\nadaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving\nenvironments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals\nthat prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit\nmode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific\ndynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves\nsubstantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates.\nComprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show\nthat our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD\napproaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical\npath toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.",

In\nthis work, we propose a Cross-Distribution Diffusion Priors-Driven Iterative\nReconstruction (CDPIR) framework to tackle the OOD problem in SVCT. CDPIR\nintegrates cross-distribution diffusion priors, derived from a Scalable\nInterpolant Transformer (SiT), with model-based iterative reconstruction\nmethods. Specifically, we train a SiT backbone, an extension of the Diffusion\nTransformer (DiT) architecture, to establish a unified stochastic interpolant\nframework, leveraging Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) across multiple datasets.\nBy randomly dropping the conditioning with a null embedding during training,\nthe model learns both domain-specific and domain-invariant priors, enhancing\ngeneralizability. During sampling, the globally sensitive transformer-based\ndiffusion model exploits the cross-distribution prior within the unified\nstochastic interpolant framework, enabling flexible and stable control over\nmulti-distribution-to-noise interpolation paths and decoupled sampling\nstrategies, thereby improving adaptation to OOD reconstruction. By alternating\nbetween data fidelity and sampling updates, our model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with superior detail preservation in SVCT reconstructions.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that CDPIR significantly outperforms existing\napproaches, particularly under OOD conditions, highlighting its robustness and\npotential clinical value in challenging imaging scenarios.",

        "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is rapidly gaining popularity for its\nphotorealistic rendering quality and real-time performance, but it generates\nmassive amounts of data. Hence compressing 3DGS data is necessary for the cost\neffectiveness of 3DGS models. Recently, several anchor-based neural compression\nmethods have been proposed, achieving good 3DGS compression performance.\nHowever, they all rely on uniform scalar quantization (USQ) due to its\nsimplicity. A tantalizing question is whether more sophisticated quantizers can\nimprove the current 3DGS compression methods with very little extra overhead\nand minimal change to the system. The answer is yes by replacing USQ with\nlattice vector quantization (LVQ). To better capture scene-specific\ncharacteristics, we optimize the lattice basis for each scene, improving LVQ's\nadaptability and R-D efficiency. This scene-adaptive LVQ (SALVQ) strikes a\nbalance between the R-D efficiency of vector quantization and the low\ncomplexity of USQ. SALVQ can be seamlessly integrated into existing 3DGS\ncompression architectures, enhancing their R-D performance with minimal\nmodifications and computational overhead. Moreover, by scaling the lattice\nbasis vectors, SALVQ can dynamically adjust lattice density, enabling a single\nmodel to accommodate multiple bit rate targets. This flexibility eliminates the\nneed to train separate models for different compression levels, significantly\nreducing training time and memory consumption.",

        "summary": "High temporal resolution is essential for capturing fine-grained details in\nvideo understanding. However, current video large language models (VLLMs) and\nbenchmarks mostly rely on low-frame-rate sampling, such as uniform sampling or\nkeyframe selection, discarding dense temporal information. This compromise\navoids the high cost of tokenizing every frame, which otherwise leads to\nredundant computation and linear token growth as video length increases. While\nthis trade-off works for slowly changing content, it fails for tasks like\nlecture comprehension, where information appears in nearly every frame and\nrequires precise temporal alignment. To address this gap, we introduce Dense\nVideo Understanding (DVU), which enables high-FPS video comprehension by\nreducing both tokenization time and token overhead. Existing benchmarks are\nalso limited, as their QA pairs focus on coarse content changes. We therefore\npropose DIVE (Dense Information Video Evaluation), the first benchmark designed\nfor dense temporal reasoning. To make DVU practical, we present Gated Residual\nTokenization (GRT), a two-stage framework: (1) Motion-Compensated Inter-Gated\nTokenization uses pixel-level motion estimation to skip static regions during\ntokenization, achieving sub-linear growth in token count and compute. (2)\nSemantic-Scene Intra-Tokenization Merging fuses tokens across static regions\nwithin a scene, further reducing redundancy while preserving dynamic semantics.\nExperiments on DIVE show that GRT outperforms larger VLLM baselines and scales\npositively with FPS. These results highlight the importance of dense temporal\ninformation and demonstrate that GRT enables efficient, scalable high-FPS video\nunderstanding.",

        "summary": "While reasoning technology like Chain of Thought (CoT) has been widely\nadopted in Vision Language Action (VLA) models, it demonstrates promising\ncapabilities in end to end autonomous driving. However, recent efforts to\nintegrate CoT reasoning often fall short in simple scenarios, introducing\nunnecessary computational overhead without improving decision quality. To\naddress this, we propose AdaThinkDrive, a novel VLA framework with a dual mode\nreasoning mechanism inspired by fast and slow thinking. First, our framework is\npretrained on large scale autonomous driving (AD) scenarios using both question\nanswering (QA) and trajectory datasets to acquire world knowledge and driving\ncommonsense. During supervised fine tuning (SFT), we introduce a two mode\ndataset, fast answering (w/o CoT) and slow thinking (with CoT), enabling the\nmodel to distinguish between scenarios that require reasoning. Furthermore, an\nAdaptive Think Reward strategy is proposed in conjunction with the Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO), which rewards the model for selectively\napplying CoT by comparing trajectory quality across different reasoning modes.\nExtensive experiments on the Navsim benchmark show that AdaThinkDrive achieves\na PDMS of 90.3, surpassing the best vision only baseline by 1.7 points.\nMoreover, ablations show that AdaThinkDrive surpasses both the never Think and\nalways Think baselines, improving PDMS by 2.0 and 1.4, respectively. It also\nreduces inference time by 14% compared to the always Think baseline,\ndemonstrating its ability to balance accuracy and efficiency through adaptive\nreasoning.",

In many resource-limited edge devices, complicated\noperations can be calculated via lookup tables to reduce computational cost.\nMotivated by this, in this paper, we introduce a generic and efficient lookup\noperation which can be used as a basic operation for the construction of neural\nnetworks. Instead of calculating the multiplication of weights and activation\nvalues, simple yet efficient lookup operations are adopted to compute their\nresponses. To enable end-to-end optimization of the lookup operation, we\nconstruct the lookup tables in a differentiable manner and propose several\ntraining strategies to promote their convergence.

        "summary": "Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) seeks to identify anomalies from arbitrary\nnovel categories, offering a scalable and annotation-efficient solution.\nTraditionally, most ZSAD works have been based on the CLIP model, which\nperforms anomaly detection by calculating the similarity between visual and\ntext embeddings. Recently, vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have\ndemonstrated strong transferable representation capabilities. In this work, we\nare the first to adapt DINOv3 for ZSAD. However, this adaptation presents two\nkey challenges: (i) the domain bias between large-scale pretraining data and\nanomaly detection tasks leads to feature misalignment; and (ii) the inherent\nbias toward global semantics in pretrained representations often leads to\nsubtle anomalies being misinterpreted as part of the normal foreground objects,\nrather than being distinguished as abnormal regions. To overcome these\nchallenges, we introduce AD-DINOv3, a novel vision-language multimodal\nframework designed for ZSAD. Specifically, we formulate anomaly detection as a\nmultimodal contrastive learning problem, where DINOv3 is employed as the visual\nbackbone to extract patch tokens and a CLS token, and the CLIP text encoder\nprovides embeddings for both normal and abnormal prompts. To bridge the domain\ngap, lightweight adapters are introduced in both modalities, enabling their\nrepresentations to be recalibrated for the anomaly detection task. Beyond this\nbaseline alignment, we further design an Anomaly-Aware Calibration Module\n(AACM), which explicitly guides the CLS token to attend to anomalous regions\nrather than generic foreground semantics, thereby enhancing discriminability.\nExtensive experiments on eight industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate\nthat AD-DINOv3 consistently matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods,\nverifying its superiority as a general zero-shot anomaly detection framework.",

While generic\nobject detectors like YOLO exhibit strong performance in low-texture scenes,\ntheir effectiveness degrades in cluttered environments with low\nobject-background separability. To address these limitations, this work\npresents an enhanced iteration of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet -- a detection framework\nthat integrates generic object detection with camouflage object detection\ntechniques. Building upon the original architecture, the proposed iteration\nintroduces systematic advancements in training data composition, feature fusion\nstrategies, and backbone design. Specifically, the training process leverages\nlarge-scale, photo-realistic synthetic data, complemented by a small set of\nreal-world samples, to enhance robustness under visually complex conditions.\nThe contribution of intermediate multi-scale FEDER features is systematically\nevaluated, and detection performance is comprehensively benchmarked across\nmultiple YOLO-based backbone configurations. Empirical results indicate that\nintegrating intermediate FEDER features, in combination with backbone upgrades,\ncontributes to notable performance improvements. In the most promising\nconfiguration -- YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with a YOLOv8l backbone and FEDER\nfeatures derived from the DWD module -- these enhancements lead to a FNR\nreduction of up to 39.1 percentage points and a mAP increase of up to 62.8\npercentage points at an IoU threshold of 0.5, compared to the initial baseline.",

While recent\nmodels, including class-agnostic counting models and large vision-language\nmodels (VLMs), show promise in counting tasks, their ability to perform\nfine-grained, intent-driven counting remains unclear. In this paper, we\nintroduce PairTally, a benchmark dataset specifically designed to evaluate\nfine-grained visual counting. Each of the 681 high-resolution images in\nPairTally contains two object categories, requiring models to distinguish and\ncount based on subtle differences in shape, size, color, or semantics. The\ndataset includes both inter-category (distinct categories) and intra-category\n(closely related subcategories) settings, making it suitable for rigorous\nevaluation of selective counting capabilities. We benchmark a variety of\nstate-of-the-art models, including exemplar-based methods, language-prompted\nmodels, and large VLMs. Our results show that despite recent advances, current\nmodels struggle to reliably count what users intend, especially in fine-grained\nand visually ambiguous cases. PairTally provides a new foundation for\ndiagnosing and improving fine-grained visual counting systems.",

        "summary": "Few-Shot 3D Point Cloud Segmentation (FS-PCS) aims to predict per-point\nlabels for an unlabeled point cloud, given only a few labeled examples. To\nextract discriminative representations from the limited support set, existing\nmethods have constructed prototypes using conventional algorithms such as\nfarthest point sampling. However, we point out that its initial randomness\nsignificantly affects FS-PCS performance and that the prototype generation\nprocess remains underexplored despite its prevalence. This motivates us to\ninvestigate an advanced prototype generation method based on attention\nmechanism. Despite its potential, we found that vanilla module suffers from the\ndistributional gap between learnable prototypical tokens and support features.\nTo overcome this, we propose White Aggregation and Restoration Module (WARM),\nwhich resolves the misalignment by sandwiching cross-attention between\nwhitening and coloring transformations. Specifically, whitening aligns the\nsupport features to prototypical tokens before attention process, and\nsubsequently coloring restores the original distribution to the attended\ntokens.

In this paper, we propose a reconstruction\nalgorithm, namely LamiGauss, that combines Gaussian Splatting radiative\nrasterization with a dedicated detector-to-world transformation model\nincorporating the laminographic tilt angle. LamiGauss leverages an\ninitialization strategy that explicitly filters out common laminographic\nartifacts from the preliminary reconstruction, preventing redundant Gaussians\nfrom being allocated to false structures and thereby concentrating model\ncapacity on representing the genuine object. Our approach effectively optimizes\ndirectly from sparse projections, enabling accurate and efficient\nreconstruction with limited data.

        "summary": "In recent years, there has been a growing trend in computer vision towards\nexploiting RAW sensor data, which preserves richer information compared to\nconventional low-bit RGB images. Early studies mainly focused on enhancing\nvisual quality, while more recent efforts aim to leverage the abundant\ninformation in RAW data to improve the performance of visual perception tasks\nsuch as object detection and segmentation. However, existing approaches still\nface two key limitations: large-scale ISP networks impose heavy computational\noverhead, while methods based on tuning traditional ISP pipelines are\nrestricted by limited representational capacity.To address these issues, we\npropose Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP), a compact RAW-to-RGB\nframework that produces task-oriented representations for pretrained vision\nmodels. Instead of heavy dense convolutional pipelines, TA-ISP predicts a small\nset of lightweight, multi-scale modulation operators that act at global,\nregional, and pixel scales to reshape image statistics across different spatial\nextents. This factorized control significantly expands the range of spatially\nvarying transforms that can be represented while keeping memory usage,\ncomputation, and latency tightly constrained. Evaluated on several RAW-domain\ndetection and segmentation benchmarks under both daytime and nighttime\nconditions, TA-ISP consistently improves downstream accuracy while markedly\nreducing parameter count and inference time, making it well suited for\ndeployment on resource-constrained devices.",

        "summary": "Image registration is a fundamental task in medical image analysis.\nDeformations are often closely related to the morphological characteristics of\ntissues, making accurate feature extraction crucial. Recent weakly supervised\nmethods improve registration by incorporating anatomical priors such as\nsegmentation masks or landmarks, either as inputs or in the loss function.\nHowever, such weak labels are often not readily available, limiting their\npractical use. Motivated by the strong representation learning ability of\nvisual foundation models, this paper introduces SAMIR, an efficient medical\nimage registration framework that utilizes the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to\nenhance feature extraction. SAM is pretrained on large-scale natural image\ndatasets and can learn robust, general-purpose visual representations. Rather\nthan using raw input images, we design a task-specific adaptation pipeline\nusing SAM's image encoder to extract structure-aware feature embeddings,\nenabling more accurate modeling of anatomical consistency and deformation\npatterns. We further design a lightweight 3D head to refine features within the\nembedding space, adapting to local deformations in medical images.\nAdditionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Feature Consistency Loss to guide\ncoarse-to-fine feature matching and improve anatomical alignment. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that SAMIR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods on benchmark datasets for both intra-subject cardiac image registration\nand inter-subject abdomen CT image registration, achieving performance\nimprovements of 2.68% on ACDC and 6.44% on the abdomen dataset.

Recent advances allow robotic interventions with lesser risk.\nThe combination of robot interventions with scene understanding and mapping\nalso opens up the possibilities for automation. We present a novel pipeline\nthat enables real-time, semantically informed 3D reconstructions of the central\nairway using monocular endoscopic video.\n  Our approach combines DROID-SLAM with a segmentation model trained to\nidentify obstructive tissues. The SLAM module reconstructs the 3D geometry of\nthe airway in real time, while the segmentation masks guide the annotation of\nobstruction regions within the reconstructed point cloud. To validate our\npipeline, we evaluate the reconstruction quality using ex vivo models.\n  Qualitative and quantitative results show high similarity between ground\ntruth CT scans and the 3D reconstructions (0.62 mm Chamfer distance). By\nintegrating segmentation directly into the SLAM workflow, our system produces\nannotated 3D maps that highlight clinically relevant regions in real time.\nHigh-speed capabilities of the pipeline allows quicker reconstructions compared\nto previous work, reflecting the surgical scene more accurately.\n  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate semantic\nsegmentation with real-time monocular SLAM for endoscopic CAO scenarios.

Specifically, to address redundant 3D Gaussian primitives in SLAM, we\npropose merging them in voxel space based on geometric similarity. This reduces\nGPU memory usage without impacting system runtime performance. Furthermore,\nrendering quality is improved by initializing 3D Gaussian primitives via\nPatch-Grid (PG) point sampling, enabling more accurate modeling of the entire\nscene. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on publicly available datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our improvements.",

        "summary": "Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most commonly performed imaging investigation. In\nthe UK, many centres experience reporting delays due to radiologist workforce\nshortages. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of distinguishing normal\nfrom abnormal CXRs have emerged as a potential solution. If normal CXRs could\nbe safely identified and reported without human input, a substantial portion of\nradiology workload could be reduced.\n  This article examines the feasibility and implications of autonomous AI\nreporting of normal CXRs. Key issues include defining normal, ensuring\ngeneralisability across populations, and managing the sensitivity-specificity\ntrade-off. It also addresses legal and regulatory challenges, such as\ncompliance with IR(ME)R and GDPR, and the lack accountability frameworks for\nerrors. Further considerations include the impact on radiologists practice, the\nneed for robust post-market surveillance, and incorporation of patient\nperspectives. While the benefits are clear, adoption must be cautious.",

        "summary": "The classification of pixel spectra of hyperspectral images, i.e. spectral\nclassification, is used in many fields ranging from agricultural, over medical\nto remote sensing applications and is currently also expanding to areas such as\nautonomous driving. Even though for full hyperspectral images the\nbest-performing methods exploit spatial-spectral information, performing\nclassification solely on spectral information has its own advantages, e.g.\nsmaller model size and thus less data required for training. Moreover, spectral\ninformation is complementary to spatial information and improvements on either\npart can be used to improve spatial-spectral approaches in the future.\nRecently, 1D-Justo-LiuNet was proposed as a particularly efficient model with\nvery few parameters, which currently defines the state of the art in spectral\nclassification. However, we show that with limited training data the model\nperformance deteriorates. Therefore, we investigate MiniROCKET and\nHDC-MiniROCKET for spectral classification to mitigate that problem. The model\nextracts well-engineered features without trainable parameters in the feature\nextraction part and is therefore less vulnerable to limited training data. We\nshow that even though MiniROCKET has more parameters it outperforms\n1D-Justo-LiuNet in limited data scenarios and is mostly on par with it in the\ngeneral case",

        "summary": "Robust object pose estimation is essential for manipulation and interaction\ntasks in robotics, particularly in scenarios where visual data is limited or\nsensitive to lighting, occlusions, and appearances. Tactile sensors often offer\nlimited and local contact information, making it challenging to reconstruct the\npose from partial data. Our approach uses sensorimotor exploration to actively\ncontrol a robot hand to interact with the object. We train with Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) to explore and collect tactile data. The collected 3D point\nclouds are used to iteratively refine the object's shape and pose. In our\nsetup, one hand holds the object steady while the other performs active\nexploration. We show that our method can actively explore an object's surface\nto identify critical pose features without prior knowledge of the object's\ngeometry.

        "summary": "Accurate identification of deforestation from satellite images is essential\nin order to understand the geographical situation of an area. This paper\nintroduces a new distributed approach to identify as well as locate\ndeforestation across different clients using Federated Learning (FL). Federated\nLearning enables distributed network clients to collaboratively train a model\nwhile maintaining data privacy and security of the active users. In our\nframework, a client corresponds to an edge satellite center responsible for\nlocal data processing. Moreover, FL provides an advantage over centralized\ntraining method which requires combining data, thereby compromising with data\nsecurity of the clients. Our framework leverages the FLOWER framework with RAY\nframework to execute the distributed learning workload. Furthermore, efficient\nclient spawning is ensured by RAY as it can select definite amount of users to\ncreate an emulation environment. Our FL framework uses YOLOS-small (a Vision\nTransformer variant), Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, and Faster R-CNN\nwith a MobileNetV3 backbone models trained and tested on publicly available\ndatasets. Our approach provides us a different view for image\nsegmentation-based tasks on satellite imagery.",
