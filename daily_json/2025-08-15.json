        "summary": "This paper addresses the performance bottlenecks of existing text-driven\nimage generation methods in terms of semantic alignment accuracy and structural\nconsistency. A high-fidelity image generation method is proposed by integrating\ntext-image contrastive constraints with structural guidance mechanisms. The\napproach introduces a contrastive learning module that builds strong\ncross-modal alignment constraints to improve semantic matching between text and\nimage. At the same time, structural priors such as semantic layout maps or edge\nsketches are used to guide the generator in spatial-level structural modeling.\nThis enhances the layout completeness and detail fidelity of the generated\nimages. Within the overall framework, the model jointly optimizes contrastive\nloss, structural consistency loss, and semantic preservation loss. A\nmulti-objective supervision mechanism is adopted to improve the semantic\nconsistency and controllability of the generated content. Systematic\nexperiments are conducted on the COCO-2014 dataset. Sensitivity analyses are\nperformed on embedding dimensions, text length, and structural guidance\nstrength. Quantitative metrics confirm the superior performance of the proposed\nmethod in terms of CLIP Score, FID, and SSIM. The results show that the method\neffectively bridges the gap between semantic alignment and structural fidelity\nwithout increasing computational complexity. It demonstrates a strong ability\nto generate semantically clear and structurally complete images, offering a\nviable technical path for joint text-image modeling and image generation.",

        "summary": "Multimodal learning has gained much success in recent years. However, current\nmultimodal fusion methods adopt the attention mechanism of Transformers to\nimplicitly learn the underlying correlation of multimodal features. As a\nresult, the multimodal model cannot capture the essential features of each\nmodality, making it difficult to comprehend complex structures and correlations\nof multimodal inputs. This paper introduces a novel Multimodal Attention-based\nNormalizing Flow (MANGO) approach\\footnote{The source code of this work will be\npublicly available.} to developing explicit, interpretable, and tractable\nmultimodal fusion learning. In particular, we propose a new Invertible\nCross-Attention (ICA) layer to develop the Normalizing Flow-based Model for\nmultimodal data. To efficiently capture the complex, underlying correlations in\nmultimodal data in our proposed invertible cross-attention layer, we propose\nthree new cross-attention mechanisms: Modality-to-Modality Cross-Attention\n(MMCA), Inter-Modality Cross-Attention (IMCA), and Learnable Inter-Modality\nCross-Attention (LICA). Finally, we introduce a new Multimodal Attention-based\nNormalizing Flow to enable the scalability of our proposed method to\nhigh-dimensional multimodal data. Our experimental results on three different\nmultimodal learning tasks, i.e., semantic segmentation, image-to-image\ntranslation, and movie genre classification, have illustrated the\nstate-of-the-art (SoTA) performance of the proposed approach.",

        "summary": "Traditional cartoon and anime production involves keyframing, inbetweening,\nand colorization stages, which require intensive manual effort. Despite recent\nadvances in AI, existing methods often handle these stages separately, leading\nto error accumulation and artifacts. For instance, inbetweening approaches\nstruggle with large motions, while colorization methods require dense per-frame\nsketches. To address this, we introduce ToonComposer, a generative model that\nunifies inbetweening and colorization into a single post-keyframing stage.\nToonComposer employs a sparse sketch injection mechanism to provide precise\ncontrol using keyframe sketches. Additionally, it uses a cartoon adaptation\nmethod with the spatial low-rank adapter to tailor a modern video foundation\nmodel to the cartoon domain while keeping its temporal prior intact. Requiring\nas few as a single sketch and a colored reference frame, ToonComposer excels\nwith sparse inputs, while also supporting multiple sketches at any temporal\nlocation for more precise motion control. This dual capability reduces manual\nworkload and improves flexibility, empowering artists in real-world scenarios.\nTo evaluate our model, we further created PKBench, a benchmark featuring\nhuman-drawn sketches that simulate real-world use cases. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that ToonComposer outperforms existing methods in visual quality,\nmotion consistency, and production efficiency, offering a superior and more\nflexible solution for AI-assisted cartoon production.",

        "summary": "Diffusion transformers currently lead the field in high-quality video\ngeneration, but their slow iterative denoising process and prohibitive\nquadratic attention costs for long sequences create significant inference\nbottlenecks. While both step distillation and sparse attention mechanisms have\nshown promise as independent acceleration strategies, effectively combining\nthese approaches presents critical challenges -- training-free integration\nyields suboptimal results, while separately training sparse attention after\nstep distillation requires prohibitively expensive high-quality video data. To\novercome these limitations, we propose BLADE, an innovative data-free joint\ntraining framework that introduces: (1) an Adaptive Block-Sparse Attention\n(ASA) mechanism for dynamically generating content-aware sparsity masks to\nfocus computation on salient spatiotemporal features, and (2) a sparsity-aware\nstep distillation paradigm built upon Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM)\nthat directly incorporates sparsity into the distillation process rather than\ntreating it as a separate compression step, with fast convergence. We validate\nBLADE on text-to-video models like CogVideoX-5B and Wan2.1-1.3B. Our framework\ndemonstrates remarkable efficiency gains across different scales. On\nWan2.1-1.3B, BLADE achieves a 14.10x end-to-end inference acceleration over a\n50-step baseline. Moreover, on models such as CogVideoX-5B with short video\nsequence lengths, our framework delivers a robust 8.89x speedup. Crucially, the\nacceleration is accompanied by a consistent quality improvement. On the\nVBench-2.0 benchmark, BLADE boosts the score of CogVideoX-5B to 0.569 (from\n0.534) and Wan2.1-1.3B to 0.570 (from 0.563), results that are further\ncorroborated by superior ratings in human evaluations.

Existing benchmarks for video authenticity detection typically\nsuffer from limited realism, insufficient scale, and inadequate complexity,\nfailing to effectively evaluate modern vision-language models against\nsophisticated forgeries. To address this critical gap, we introduce AEGIS, a\nnovel large-scale benchmark explicitly targeting the detection of\nhyper-realistic and semantically nuanced AI-generated videos. AEGIS comprises\nover 10,000 rigorously curated real and synthetic videos generated by diverse,\nstate-of-the-art generative models, including Stable Video Diffusion,\nCogVideoX-5B, KLing, and Sora, encompassing open-source and proprietary\narchitectures. In particular, AEGIS features specially constructed challenging\nsubsets enhanced with robustness evaluation. Furthermore, we provide multimodal\nannotations spanning Semantic-Authenticity Descriptions, Motion Features, and\nLow-level Visual Features, facilitating authenticity detection and supporting\ndownstream tasks such as multimodal fusion and forgery localization. Extensive\nexperiments using advanced vision-language models demonstrate limited detection\ncapabilities on the most challenging subsets of AEGIS, highlighting the\ndataset's unique complexity and realism beyond the current generalization\ncapabilities of existing models. In essence, AEGIS establishes an indispensable\nevaluation benchmark, fundamentally advancing research toward developing\ngenuinely robust, reliable, broadly generalizable video authenticity detection\nmethodologies capable of addressing real-world forgery threats.

However, they still\nstruggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects\nspecified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely\non either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity\nrepresentations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they\nstill have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects\nand overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object\ninstances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps\nof the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image\ngeneration, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at\nthe early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region\nshould be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose\n\\textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to\nbe clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without\nrelying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method\npartitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time\nbased on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster\nis spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target\ndistribution.

However, current methods frequently produce videos\nwith motion blur and lip jitter, primarily due to their reliance on implicit\nmodeling of audio-facial motion correlations--an approach lacking explicit\narticulatory priors (i.e., anatomical guidance for speech-related facial\nmovements). To overcome this limitation, we propose HM-Talker, a novel\nframework for generating high-fidelity, temporally coherent talking heads.\nHM-Talker leverages a hybrid motion representation combining both implicit and\nexplicit motion cues. Explicit cues use Action Units (AUs), anatomically\ndefined facial muscle movements, alongside implicit features to minimize\nphoneme-viseme misalignment. Specifically, our Cross-Modal Disentanglement\nModule (CMDM) extracts complementary implicit/explicit motion features while\npredicting AUs directly from audio input aligned to visual cues. To mitigate\nidentity-dependent biases in explicit features and enhance cross-subject\ngeneralization, we introduce the Hybrid Motion Modeling Module (HMMM). This\nmodule dynamically merges randomly paired implicit/explicit features, enforcing\nidentity-agnostic learning. Together, these components enable robust lip\nsynchronization across diverse identities, advancing personalized talking head\nsynthesis.

        "summary": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in\ntext-to-image synthesis. However, in the domain of controllable text-to-image\ngeneration using DiTs, most existing methods still rely on the ControlNet\nparadigm originally designed for UNet-based diffusion models. This paradigm\nintroduces significant parameter overhead and increased computational costs. To\naddress these challenges, we propose the Nano Control Diffusion Transformer\n(NanoControl), which employs Flux as the backbone network. Our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art controllable text-to-image generation performance while\nincurring only a 0.024\\% increase in parameter count and a 0.029\\% increase in\nGFLOPs, thus enabling highly efficient controllable generation. Specifically,\nrather than duplicating the DiT backbone for control, we design a LoRA-style\n(low-rank adaptation) control module that directly learns control signals from\nraw conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce a KV-Context Augmentation\nmechanism that integrates condition-specific key-value information into the\nbackbone in a simple yet highly effective manner, facilitating deep fusion of\nconditional features. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that\nNanoControl significantly reduces computational overhead compared to\nconventional control approaches, while maintaining superior generation quality\nand achieving improved controllability.",

By learning\ngeometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets, STream3R generalizes well to\ndiverse and challenging scenarios, including dynamic scenes where traditional\nmethods often fail.

        "summary": "Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the creation of\nhigh-quality, visually compelling videos. However, generating videos that\nadhere to the laws of physics remains a critical challenge for applications\nrequiring realism and accuracy. In this work, we propose PhysHPO, a novel\nframework for Hierarchical Cross-Modal Direct Preference Optimization, to\ntackle this challenge by enabling fine-grained preference alignment for\nphysically plausible video generation. PhysHPO optimizes video alignment across\nfour hierarchical granularities: a) Instance Level, aligning the overall video\ncontent with the input prompt; b) State Level, ensuring temporal consistency\nusing boundary frames as anchors; c) Motion Level, modeling motion trajectories\nfor realistic dynamics; and d) Semantic Level, maintaining logical consistency\nbetween narrative and visuals. Recognizing that real-world videos are the best\nreflections of physical phenomena, we further introduce an automated data\nselection pipeline to efficiently identify and utilize \"good data\" from\nexisting large-scale text-video datasets, thereby eliminating the need for\ncostly and time-intensive dataset construction. Extensive experiments on both\nphysics-focused and general capability benchmarks demonstrate that PhysHPO\nsignificantly improves physical plausibility and overall video generation\nquality of advanced models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nwork to explore fine-grained preference alignment and data selection for video\ngeneration, paving the way for more realistic and human-preferred video\ngeneration paradigms.",

Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a principled\nframework for optimizing non-differentiable, preference-driven, and temporally\nstructured objectives. Recent advances demonstrate its effectiveness in\nenhancing controllability, consistency, and human alignment across generative\ntasks. This survey provides a systematic overview of RL-based methods for\nvisual content generation. We review the evolution of RL from classical control\nto its role as a general-purpose optimization tool, and examine its integration\ninto image, video, and 3D/4D generation. Across these domains, RL serves not\nonly as a fine-tuning mechanism but also as a structural component for aligning\ngeneration with complex, high-level goals.

        "summary": "Federated learning (FL) has proven essential for privacy-preserving,\ncollaborative training across distributed clients. Our prior work, TransFed,\nintroduced a robust transformer-based FL framework that leverages a\nlearn-to-adapt hypernetwork to generate personalized focal modulation layers\nper client, outperforming traditional methods in non-IID and cross-domain\nsettings. In this extended version, we propose AdaptFED, where we deepen the\ninvestigation of focal modulation in generalizable FL by incorporating: (1) a\nrefined adaptation strategy that integrates task-aware client embeddings to\npersonalize modulation dynamics further, (2) enhanced theoretical bounds on\nadaptation performance, and (3) broader empirical validation across additional\nmodalities, including time-series and multilingual data. We also introduce an\nefficient variant of TransFed that reduces server-client communication overhead\nvia low-rank hypernetwork conditioning, enabling scalable deployment in\nresource-constrained environments. Extensive experiments on eight diverse\ndatasets reaffirm the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art\nbaselines, particularly in source-free and cross-task federated setups. Our\nfindings not only extend the capabilities of focal modulation in FL but also\npave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and generalizable transformer-based\nfederated systems.

To address this issue, we propose BaCon-Stereo, a simple yet\neffective contrastive learning framework for self-supervised stereo network\ntraining in both non-occluded and occluded regions. We adopt a teacher-student\nparadigm with multi-baseline inputs, in which the stereo pairs fed into the\nteacher and student share the same reference view but differ in target views.\nGeometrically, regions occluded in the student's target view are often visible\nin the teacher's, making it easier for the teacher to predict in these regions.\nThe teacher's prediction is rescaled to match the student's baseline and then\nused to supervise the student. We also introduce an occlusion-aware attention\nmap to better guide the student in learning occlusion completion. To support\ntraining, we synthesize a multi-baseline dataset BaCon-20k.

Existing diffusion models often produce\nlow-fidelity images due to their inability to adequately capture morphological\ndetails, which may affect the robustness and reliability of object detection\nmodels. To enhance the accuracy and fidelity of generated objects in remote\nsensing, this paper proposes Object Fidelity Diffusion (OF-Diff), which\neffectively improves the fidelity of generated objects. Specifically, we are\nthe first to extract the prior shapes of objects based on the layout for\ndiffusion models in remote sensing. Then, we introduce a dual-branch diffusion\nmodel with diffusion consistency loss, which can generate high-fidelity remote\nsensing images without providing real images during the sampling phase.\nFurthermore, we introduce DDPO to fine-tune the diffusion process, making the\ngenerated remote sensing images more diverse and semantically consistent.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that OF-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods in the remote sensing across key quality metrics. Notably, the\nperformance of several polymorphic and small object classes shows significant\nimprovement.

        "summary": "Accurate vessel segmentation in X-ray angiograms is crucial for numerous\nclinical applications. However, the scarcity of annotated data presents a\nsignificant challenge, which has driven the adoption of self-supervised\nlearning (SSL) methods such as masked image modeling (MIM) to leverage\nlarge-scale unlabeled data for learning transferable representations.\nUnfortunately, conventional MIM often fails to capture vascular anatomy because\nof the severe class imbalance between vessel and background pixels, leading to\nweak vascular representations. To address this, we introduce Vascular\nanatomy-aware Masked Image Modeling (VasoMIM), a novel MIM framework tailored\nfor X-ray angiograms that explicitly integrates anatomical knowledge into the\npre-training process. Specifically, it comprises two complementary components:\nanatomy-guided masking strategy and anatomical consistency loss. The former\npreferentially masks vessel-containing patches to focus the model on\nreconstructing vessel-relevant regions. The latter enforces consistency in\nvascular semantics between the original and reconstructed images, thereby\nimproving the discriminability of vascular representations. Empirically,\nVasoMIM achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets. These\nfindings highlight its potential to facilitate X-ray angiogram analysis.",

        "summary": "Atlas construction is fundamental to medical image analysis, offering a\nstandardized spatial reference for tasks such as population-level anatomical\nmodeling. While data-driven registration methods have recently shown promise in\npairwise settings, their reliance on large training datasets, limited\ngeneralizability, and lack of true inference phases in groupwise contexts\nhinder their practical use. In contrast, model-driven methods offer\ntraining-free, theoretically grounded, and data-efficient alternatives, though\nthey often face scalability and optimization challenges when applied to large\n3D datasets. In this work, we introduce DARC (Diffeomorphic Atlas Registration\nvia Coordinate descent), a novel model-driven groupwise registration framework\nfor atlas construction. DARC supports a broad range of image dissimilarity\nmetrics and efficiently handles arbitrary numbers of 3D images without\nincurring GPU memory issues. Through a coordinate descent strategy and a\ncentrality-enforcing activation function, DARC produces unbiased, diffeomorphic\natlases with high anatomical fidelity. Beyond atlas construction, we\ndemonstrate two key applications: (1) One-shot segmentation, where labels\nannotated only on the atlas are propagated to subjects via inverse\ndeformations, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot methods; and (2) shape\nsynthesis, where new anatomical variants are generated by warping the atlas\nmesh using synthesized diffeomorphic deformation fields. Overall, DARC offers a\nflexible, generalizable, and resource-efficient framework for atlas\nconstruction and applications.",

        "title": "Forgery Guided Learning Strategy with Dual Perception Network for Deepfake Cross-domain Detection",
        "summary": "The emergence of deepfake technology has introduced a range of societal\nproblems, garnering considerable attention. Current deepfake detection methods\nperform well on specific datasets, but exhibit poor performance when applied to\ndatasets with unknown forgery techniques. Moreover, as the gap between emerging\nand traditional forgery techniques continues to widen, cross-domain detection\nmethods that rely on common forgery traces are becoming increasingly\nineffective. This situation highlights the urgency of developing deepfake\ndetection technology with strong generalization to cope with fast iterative\nforgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a Forgery Guided\nLearning (FGL) strategy designed to enable detection networks to continuously\nadapt to unknown forgery techniques. Specifically, the FGL strategy captures\nthe differential information between known and unknown forgery techniques,\nallowing the model to dynamically adjust its learning process in real time. To\nfurther improve the ability to perceive forgery traces, we design a Dual\nPerception Network (DPNet) that captures both differences and relationships\namong forgery traces. In the frequency stream, the network dynamically\nperceives and extracts discriminative features across various forgery\ntechniques, establishing essential detection cues. These features are then\nintegrated with spatial features and projected into the embedding space. In\naddition, graph convolution is employed to perceive relationships across the\nentire feature space, facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of\nforgery trace correlations. Extensive experiments show that our approach\ngeneralizes well across different scenarios and effectively handles unknown\nforgery challenges, providing robust support for deepfake detection.

A total of nine research groups submitted\ndiverse segmentation models, employing a variety of architectural designs,\nincluding transformer-based solutions, lightweight models, and segmentation\nnetworks guided by generative frameworks.

        "title": "Exploiting Discriminative Codebook Prior for Autoregressive Image Generation",
        "summary": "Advanced discrete token-based autoregressive image generation systems first\ntokenize images into sequences of token indices with a codebook, and then model\nthese sequences in an autoregressive paradigm. While autoregressive generative\nmodels are trained only on index values, the prior encoded in the codebook,\nwhich contains rich token similarity information, is not exploited. Recent\nstudies have attempted to incorporate this prior by performing naive k-means\nclustering on the tokens, helping to facilitate the training of generative\nmodels with a reduced codebook. However, we reveal that k-means clustering\nperforms poorly in the codebook feature space due to inherent issues, including\ntoken space disparity and centroid distance inaccuracy. In this work, we\npropose the Discriminative Codebook Prior Extractor (DCPE) as an alternative to\nk-means clustering for more effectively mining and utilizing the token\nsimilarity information embedded in the codebook. DCPE replaces the commonly\nused centroid-based distance, which is found to be unsuitable and inaccurate\nfor the token feature space, with a more reasonable instance-based distance.\nUsing an agglomerative merging technique, it further addresses the token space\ndisparity issue by avoiding splitting high-density regions and aggregating\nlow-density ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCPE is plug-and-play\nand integrates seamlessly with existing codebook prior-based paradigms. With\nthe discriminative prior extracted, DCPE accelerates the training of\nautoregressive models by 42% on LlamaGen-B and improves final FID and IS\nperformance.",

        "summary": "Synthesizing novel views from a single input image is a challenging task. It\nrequires extrapolating the 3D structure of a scene while inferring details in\noccluded regions, and maintaining geometric consistency across viewpoints. Many\nexisting methods must fine-tune large diffusion backbones using multiple views\nor train a diffusion model from scratch, which is extremely expensive.\nAdditionally, they suffer from blurry reconstruction and poor generalization.\nThis gap presents the opportunity to explore an explicit lightweight view\ntranslation framework that can directly utilize the high-fidelity generative\ncapabilities of a pretrained diffusion model while reconstructing a scene from\na novel view. Given the DDIM-inverted latent of a single input image, we employ\na camera pose-conditioned translation U-Net, TUNet, to predict the inverted\nlatent corresponding to the desired target view. However, the image sampled\nusing the predicted latent may result in a blurry reconstruction. To this end,\nwe propose a novel fusion strategy that exploits the inherent noise correlation\nstructure observed in DDIM inversion. The proposed fusion strategy helps\npreserve the texture and fine-grained details. To synthesize the novel view, we\nuse the fused latent as the initial condition for DDIM sampling, leveraging the\ngenerative prior of the pretrained diffusion model.

Recently, some FS-IAD methods based\non Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have been proposed with some\nachievements through prompt learning or fine-tuning. However, existing LVLMs\nfocus on general tasks but lack basic industrial knowledge and reasoning\ncapabilities related to FS-IAD, making these methods far from specialized human\nquality inspectors. To address these challenges, we propose a unified\nframework, IADGPT, designed to perform FS-IAD in a human-like manner, while\nalso handling associated localization and reasoning tasks, even for diverse and\nnovel industrial products. To this end, we introduce a three-stage progressive\ntraining strategy inspired by humans. Specifically, the first two stages\ngradually guide IADGPT in acquiring fundamental industrial knowledge and\ndiscrepancy awareness. In the third stage, we design an in-context\nlearning-based training paradigm, enabling IADGPT to leverage a few-shot image\nas the exemplars for improved generalization to novel products. In addition, we\ndesign a strategy that enables IADGPT to output image-level and pixel-level\nanomaly scores using the logits output and the attention map, respectively, in\nconjunction with the language output to accomplish anomaly reasoning. To\nsupport our training, we present a new dataset comprising 100K images across\n400 diverse industrial product categories with extensive attribute-level\ntextual annotations.

To handle this challenge, we begin with a\nthorough cleaning of the baseline HSFace dataset, identifying and removing\nmislabeled or inconsistent identities through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\nstrategy combining face embedding clustering and GPT-4o-assisted verification.\nWe retain the largest consistent identity cluster and apply data augmentation\nup to a fixed number of images per identity. To further diversify the dataset,\nwe generate synthetic identities using Stable Diffusion with prompt\nengineering. As diffusion models are computationally intensive, we generate\nonly one reference image per identity and efficiently expand it using Vec2Face,\nwhich rapidly produces 49 identity-consistent variants. This hybrid approach\nfuses GAN-based and diffusion-based samples, enabling efficient construction of\na diverse and high-quality dataset. To address the high visual similarity among\nsynthetic identities, we adopt a curriculum learning strategy by placing them\nearly in the training schedule, allowing the model to progress from easier to\nharder samples.

In this way, the performance degradation\ncan be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally\naligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further\nexploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments\nconducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of\nUniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification\nprocess. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance\ndegradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity.\nAdditionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels\nacross tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for\nfuture multi-modal vision research.

        "summary": "Visual transfer learning for unseen categories presents an active research\ntopic yet a challenging task, due to the inherent conflict between preserving\ncategory-specific representations and acquiring transferable knowledge.\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) pre-trained on large amounts of image-text pairs\noffer a promising solution. However, existing prompt tuning methods rely on\nsparse category labels or disparate LLM-generated descriptions, which fragment\nknowledge representation and hinder transferability. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce Semantic Prompt Tuning (SemPT), a novel framework that\ntackles the generalization challenge by leveraging shared attribute-level\nknowledge across categories. Specifically, SemPT adopts a two-step prompting\nstrategy to guide LLM in extracting shared visual attributes and generating\nattribute-level descriptions, capturing transferable semantic cues beyond\nlabels while ensuring coherent structure. Then, visually guided weighting is\napplied to the embeddings of attribute-level descriptions to reduce noise from\nirrelevant attributes and enhance the text embeddings. Additionally, image\nembeddings are jointly aligned with both label and attribute-enhanced text\nembeddings, balancing discrimination for seen categories and transferability to\nunseen ones. Considering the availability of category exposure, our inference\ndynamically selects between standard label embeddings for seen categories and\nattribute-enhanced embeddings for unseen ones to ensure effective adaptation.\nExtensive experiments on 15 benchmark datasets demonstrate that SemPT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across various settings, including base-to-novel\ngeneralization, cross-dataset transfer, cross-domain transfer, and few-shot\nlearning.",

        "summary": "Conditional image generative models hold considerable promise to produce\ninfinite amounts of synthetic training data. Yet, recent progress in generation\nquality has come at the expense of generation diversity, limiting the utility\nof these models as a source of synthetic training data. Although guidance-based\napproaches have been introduced to improve the utility of generated data by\nfocusing on quality or diversity, the (implicit or explicit) utility functions\noftentimes disregard the potential distribution shift between synthetic and\nreal data. In this work, we introduce Chamfer Guidance: a training-free\nguidance approach which leverages a handful of real exemplar images to\ncharacterize the quality and diversity of synthetic data. We show that by\nleveraging the proposed Chamfer Guidance, we can boost the diversity of the\ngenerations w.r.t. a dataset of real images while maintaining or improving the\ngeneration quality on ImageNet-1k and standard geo-diversity benchmarks. Our\napproach achieves state-of-the-art few-shot performance with as little as 2\nexemplar real images, obtaining 96.4\\% in terms of precision, and 86.4\\% in\nterms of distributional coverage, which increase to 97.5\\% and 92.7\\%,\nrespectively, when using 32 real images. We showcase the benefits of the\nChamfer Guidance generation by training downstream image classifiers on\nsynthetic data, achieving accuracy boost of up to 15\\% for in-distribution over\nthe baselines, and up to 16\\% in out-of-distribution. Furthermore, our approach\ndoes not require using the unconditional model, and thus obtains a 31\\%\nreduction in FLOPs w.r.t. classifier-free-guidance-based approaches at sampling\ntime.",

        "summary": "Bolt defect detection is critical to ensure the safety of transmission lines.\nHowever, the scarcity of defect images and imbalanced data distributions\nsignificantly limit detection performance. To address this problem, we propose\na segmentationdriven bolt defect editing method (SBDE) to augment the dataset.\nFirst, a bolt attribute segmentation model (Bolt-SAM) is proposed, which\nenhances the segmentation of complex bolt attributes through the CLAHE-FFT\nAdapter (CFA) and Multipart- Aware Mask Decoder (MAMD), generating high-quality\nmasks for subsequent editing tasks. Second, a mask optimization module (MOD) is\ndesigned and integrated with the image inpainting model (LaMa) to construct the\nbolt defect attribute editing model (MOD-LaMa), which converts normal bolts\ninto defective ones through attribute editing. Finally, an editing recovery\naugmentation (ERA) strategy is proposed to recover and put the edited defect\nbolts back into the original inspection scenes and expand the defect detection\ndataset. We constructed multiple bolt datasets and conducted extensive\nexperiments. Experimental results demonstrate that the bolt defect images\ngenerated by SBDE significantly outperform state-of-the-art image editing\nmodels, and effectively improve the performance of bolt defect detection, which\nfully verifies the effectiveness and application potential of the proposed\nmethod.

To address this, we propose a comprehensive optimization\nframework integrating multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA) with dual geometric\nconstraints. Our system computes pixel colors through adaptive blending of\nquadruple subsamples, effectively reducing aliasing artifacts in high-frequency\ncomponents. The framework introduces two constraints: (a) an adaptive weighting\nstrategy that prioritizes under-reconstructed regions through dynamic gradient\nanalysis, and (b) gradient differential constraints enforcing geometric\nregularization at object boundaries. This targeted optimization enables the\nmodel to allocate computational resources preferentially to critical regions\nrequiring refinement while maintaining global consistency.

However, large-scale STAS diagnosis in LUAD remains a labor-intensive\nendeavor, compounded by the propensity for oversight and misdiagnosis due to\nits distinctive pathological characteristics and morphological features.\nConsequently, there is a pressing clinical imperative to leverage deep learning\nmodels for STAS diagnosis. This study initially assembled histopathological\nimages from STAS patients at the Second Xiangya Hospital and the Third Xiangya\nHospital of Central South University, alongside the TCGA-LUAD cohort. Three\nsenior pathologists conducted cross-verification annotations to construct the\nSTAS-SXY, STAS-TXY, and STAS-TCGA datasets. We then propose a multi-pattern\nattention-aware multiple instance learning framework, named STAMP, to analyze\nand diagnose the presence of STAS across multi-center histopathology images.\nSpecifically, the dual-branch architecture guides the model to learn\nSTAS-associated pathological features from distinct semantic spaces.\nTransformer-based instance encoding and a multi-pattern attention aggregation\nmodules dynamically selects regions closely associated with STAS pathology,\nsuppressing irrelevant noise and enhancing the discriminative power of global\nrepresentations. Moreover, a similarity regularization constraint prevents\nfeature redundancy across branches, thereby improving overall diagnostic\naccuracy.

        "summary": "Online video super-resolution (VSR) is an important technique for many\nreal-world video processing applications, which aims to restore the current\nhigh-resolution video frame based on temporally previous frames. Most of the\nexisting online VSR methods solely employ one neighboring previous frame to\nachieve temporal alignment, which limits long-range temporal modeling of\nvideos. Recently, state space models (SSMs) have been proposed with linear\ncomputational complexity and a global receptive field, which significantly\nimprove computational efficiency and performance. In this context, this paper\npresents a novel online VSR method based on Trajectory-aware Shifted SSMs\n(TS-Mamba), leveraging both long-term trajectory modeling and low-complexity\nMamba to achieve efficient spatio-temporal information aggregation.\nSpecifically, TS-Mamba first constructs the trajectories within a video to\nselect the most similar tokens from the previous frames. Then, a\nTrajectory-aware Shifted Mamba Aggregation (TSMA) module consisting of proposed\nshifted SSMs blocks is employed to aggregate the selected tokens. The shifted\nSSMs blocks are designed based on Hilbert scannings and corresponding shift\noperations to compensate for scanning losses and strengthen the spatial\ncontinuity of Mamba. Additionally, we propose a trajectory-aware loss function\nto supervise the trajectory generation, ensuring the accuracy of token\nselection when training our model. Extensive experiments on three widely used\nVSR test datasets demonstrate that compared with six online VSR benchmark\nmodels, our TS-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases and\nover 22.7\\% complexity reduction (in MACs).

However, existing\nmethods typically require dual-modality annotations to output detection results\nfor both modalities during prediction, which incurs high annotation costs. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a novel infrared-visible Decoupled Object\nDetection framework with Single-modality Annotations, called DOD-SA. The\narchitecture of DOD-SA is built upon a Single- and Dual-Modality Collaborative\nTeacher-Student Network (CoSD-TSNet), which consists of a single-modality\nbranch (SM-Branch) and a dual-modality decoupled branch (DMD-Branch). The\nteacher model generates pseudo-labels for the unlabeled modality,\nsimultaneously supporting the training of the student model. The collaborative\ndesign enables cross-modality knowledge transfer from the labeled modality to\nthe unlabeled modality, and facilitates effective SM-to-DMD branch supervision.\nTo further improve the decoupling ability of the model and the pseudo-label\nquality, we introduce a Progressive and Self-Tuning Training Strategy (PaST)\nthat trains the model in three stages: (1) pretraining SM-Branch, (2) guiding\nthe learning of DMD-Branch by SM-Branch, and (3) refining DMD-Branch. In\naddition, we design a Pseudo Label Assigner (PLA) to align and pair labels\nacross modalities, explicitly addressing modality misalignment during training.\nExtensive experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA).",

For example, when generating an image of ``Charlie\nChaplin\", a ``mustache\" consistently appears even if explicitly instructed not\nto include it, as the concept of ``mustache\" is strongly entangled with\n``Charlie Chaplin\". To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to\ndirectly suppress such entangled content within the text embedding space of\ndiffusion models. Our method introduces a delta vector that modifies the text\nembedding to weaken the influence of undesired content in the generated image,\nand we further demonstrate that this delta vector can be easily obtained\nthrough a zero-shot approach. Furthermore, we propose a Selective Suppression\nwith Delta Vector (SSDV) method to adapt delta vector into the cross-attention\nmechanism, enabling more effective suppression of unwanted content in regions\nwhere it would otherwise be generated. Additionally, we enabled more precise\nsuppression in personalized T2I models by optimizing delta vector, which\nprevious baselines were unable to achieve. Extensive experimental results\ndemonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods, both\nin terms of quantitative and qualitative metrics.",

        "summary": "Image generation models trained on large datasets can synthesize high-quality\nimages but often produce spatially inconsistent and distorted images due to\nlimited information about the underlying structures and spatial layouts. In\nthis work, we leverage intrinsic scene properties (e.g., depth, segmentation\nmaps) that provide rich information about the underlying scene, unlike prior\napproaches that solely rely on image-text pairs or use intrinsics as\nconditional inputs. Our approach aims to co-generate both images and their\ncorresponding intrinsics, enabling the model to implicitly capture the\nunderlying scene structure and generate more spatially consistent and realistic\nimages. Specifically, we first extract rich intrinsic scene properties from a\nlarge image dataset with pre-trained estimators, eliminating the need for\nadditional scene information or explicit 3D representations. We then aggregate\nvarious intrinsic scene properties into a single latent variable using an\nautoencoder. Building upon pre-trained large-scale Latent Diffusion Models\n(LDMs), our method simultaneously denoises the image and intrinsic domains by\ncarefully sharing mutual information so that the image and intrinsic reflect\neach other without degrading image quality. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our method corrects spatial inconsistencies and produces a more natural\nlayout of scenes while maintaining the fidelity and textual alignment of the\nbase model (e.g., Stable Diffusion).",

This visual-to-neural\nmapping is inherently a one-to-many relationship, as identical visual inputs\nreliably evoke variable hemodynamic responses across trials, contexts, and\nsubjects. However, existing deterministic methods struggle to simultaneously\nmodel this biological variability while capturing the underlying functional\nconsistency that encodes stimulus information. To address these limitations, we\npropose SynBrain, a generative framework that simulates the transformation from\nvisual semantics to neural responses in a probabilistic and biologically\ninterpretable manner. SynBrain introduces two key components: (i) BrainVAE\nmodels neural representations as continuous probability distributions via\nprobabilistic learning while maintaining functional consistency through visual\nsemantic constraints; (ii) A Semantic-to-Neural Mapper acts as a semantic\ntransmission pathway, projecting visual semantics into the neural response\nmanifold to facilitate high-fidelity fMRI synthesis. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that SynBrain surpasses state-of-the-art methods in\nsubject-specific visual-to-fMRI encoding performance. Furthermore, SynBrain\nadapts efficiently to new subjects with few-shot data and synthesizes\nhigh-quality fMRI signals that are effective in improving data-limited\nfMRI-to-image decoding performance.

        "summary": "As an emerging novel view synthesis approach, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)\ndemonstrates fast training/rendering with superior visual quality. The two\ntasks of 3DGS, Gaussian creation and view rendering, are typically separated\nover time or devices, and thus storage/transmission and finally compression of\n3DGS Gaussians become necessary. We begin with a correlation and statistical\nanalysis of 3DGS Gaussian attributes. An inspiring finding in this work reveals\nthat spherical harmonic AC attributes precisely follow Laplace distributions,\nwhile mixtures of Gaussian distributions can approximate rotation, scaling, and\nopacity. Additionally, harmonic AC attributes manifest weak correlations with\nother attributes except for inherited correlations from a color space. A\nfactorized and parameterized entropy coding method, EntropyGS, is hereinafter\nproposed. During encoding, distribution parameters of each Gaussian attribute\nare estimated to assist their entropy coding. The quantization for entropy\ncoding is adaptively performed according to Gaussian attribute types. EntropyGS\ndemonstrates about 30x rate reduction on benchmark datasets while maintaining\nsimilar rendering quality compared to input 3DGS data, with a fast encoding and\ndecoding time.",

        "summary": "Large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have transformed general-purpose\nvisual recognition through strong zero-shot capabilities. However, their\nperformance degrades significantly in niche, safety-critical domains such as\nindustrial spill detection, where hazardous events are rare, sensitive, and\ndifficult to annotate. This scarcity -- driven by privacy concerns, data\nsensitivity, and the infrequency of real incidents -- renders conventional\nfine-tuning of detectors infeasible for most industrial settings.\n  We address this challenge by introducing a scalable framework centered on a\nhigh-quality synthetic data generation pipeline. We demonstrate that this\nsynthetic corpus enables effective Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of\nVLMs and substantially boosts the performance of state-of-the-art object\ndetectors such as YOLO and DETR. Notably, in the absence of synthetic data\n(SynSpill dataset), VLMs still generalize better to unseen spill scenarios than\nthese detectors. When SynSpill is used, both VLMs and detectors achieve marked\nimprovements, with their performance becoming comparable.\n  Our results underscore that high-fidelity synthetic data is a powerful means\nto bridge the domain gap in safety-critical applications. The combination of\nsynthetic generation and lightweight adaptation offers a cost-effective,\nscalable pathway for deploying vision systems in industrial environments where\nreal data is scarce/impractical to obtain.\n  Project Page: https://synspill.vercel.app",

        "summary": "The current advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) models\nhave paved the way for new possibilities for generating high-resolution\nsynthetic images, thereby offering a promising alternative to traditional image\nacquisition for training computer vision models in agriculture. In the context\nof crop disease diagnosis, GenAI models are being used to create synthetic\nimages of various diseases, potentially facilitating model creation and\nreducing the dependency on resource-intensive in-field data collection.\nHowever, limited research has been conducted on evaluating the effectiveness of\nintegrating real with synthetic images to improve disease classification\nperformance. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether combining a\nlimited number of real images with synthetic images can enhance the prediction\naccuracy of an EfficientNetV2-L model for classifying watermelon\n\\textit{(Citrullus lanatus)} diseases. The training dataset was divided into\nfive treatments: H0 (only real images), H1 (only synthetic images), H2 (1:1\nreal-to-synthetic), H3 (1:10 real-to-synthetic), and H4 (H3 + random images to\nimprove variability and model generalization). All treatments were trained\nusing a custom EfficientNetV2-L architecture with enhanced fine-tuning and\ntransfer learning techniques. Models trained on H2, H3, and H4 treatments\ndemonstrated high precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Additionally, the\nweighted F1-score increased from 0.65 (on H0) to 1.00 (on H3-H4) signifying\nthat the addition of a small number of real images with a considerable volume\nof synthetic images improved model performance and generalizability. Overall,\nthis validates the findings that synthetic images alone cannot adequately\nsubstitute for real images; instead, both must be used in a hybrid manner to\nmaximize model performance for crop disease classification.",

        "summary": "Learning-based autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to\nadversarial patches, posing serious safety and security risks in their\nreal-world deployment. Black-box attacks, notable for their high attack success\nrate without model knowledge, are especially concerning, with their\ntransferability extensively studied to reduce computational costs compared to\nquery-based attacks. Previous transferability-based black-box attacks typically\nadopt mean Average Precision (mAP) as the evaluation metric and design training\nloss accordingly. However, due to the presence of multiple detected bounding\nboxes and the relatively lenient Intersection over Union (IoU) thresholds, the\nattack effectiveness of these approaches is often overestimated, resulting in\nreduced success rates in practical attacking scenarios. Furthermore, patches\ntrained on low-resolution data often fail to maintain effectiveness on\nhigh-resolution images, limiting their transferability to autonomous driving\ndatasets. To fill this gap, we propose P$^3$A, a Powerful and Practical Patch\nAttack framework for 2D object detection in autonomous driving, specifically\noptimized for high-resolution datasets. First, we introduce a novel metric,\nPractical Attack Success Rate (PASR), to more accurately quantify attack\neffectiveness with greater relevance for pedestrian safety. Second, we present\na tailored Localization-Confidence Suppression Loss (LCSL) to improve attack\ntransferability under PASR. Finally, to maintain the transferability for\nhigh-resolution datasets, we further incorporate the Probabilistic\nScale-Preserving Padding (PSPP) into the patch attack pipeline as a data\npreprocessing step.

        "summary": "End-to-end autonomous driving systems promise stronger performance through\nunified optimization of perception, motion forecasting, and planning. However,\nvision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather\nconditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical\nchallenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding\nand long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.\nTo address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end\ncamera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through\nsparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve\nstrong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines\nand motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the\nstate-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving\ntasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA),\nonline mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory\nplanning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal\nconsistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop\nnuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We\nshow the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where\naccurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are\nessential for collision avoidance.

        "summary": "Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for the reliable deployment of\nmachine learning models in-the-wild, enabling accurate identification of test\nsamples that differ from the training data distribution. Existing methods rely\non auxiliary outlier samples or in-distribution (ID) data to generate outlier\ninformation for training, but due to limited outliers and their mismatch with\nreal test OOD samples, they often fail to provide sufficient semantic\nsupervision, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a\nnovel OOD detection method called Retrieval-Augmented Prompt (RAP). RAP\naugments a pre-trained vision-language model's prompts by retrieving external\nknowledge, offering enhanced semantic supervision for OOD detection. During\ntraining, RAP retrieves descriptive words for outliers based on joint\nsimilarity with external textual knowledge and uses them to augment the model's\nOOD prompts. During testing, RAP dynamically updates OOD prompts in real-time\nbased on the encountered OOD samples, enabling the model to rapidly adapt to\nthe test environment. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on large-scale OOD detection benchmarks. For\nexample, in 1-shot OOD detection on the ImageNet-1k dataset, RAP reduces the\naverage FPR95 by 7.05% and improves the AUROC by 1.71% compared to previous\nmethods.

However, known issues with AR\ndepth perception due to vergence-accommodation conflict and occlusion handling\nlimitations of the currently commercially available display technology present\nacute challenges in surgical settings where precision is paramount. This study\npresents a novel methodology for utilizing AR guidance to register anatomical\ntargets and provide real-time instrument navigation using placement of\nsimulated external ventricular drain catheters on a phantom model as the\nclinical scenario. The system registers target positions to the patient through\na novel surface tracing method and uses real-time infrared tool tracking to aid\nin catheter placement, relying only on the onboard sensors of the Microsoft\nHoloLens 2. A group of intended users performed the procedure of simulated\ninsertions under two AR guidance conditions: static in-situ visualization,\nwhere planned trajectories are overlaid directly onto the patient anatomy, and\nreal-time tool-tracking guidance, where live feedback of the catheter's pose is\nprovided relative to the plan. Following the insertion tests, computed\ntomography scans of the phantom models were acquired, allowing for evaluation\nof insertion accuracy, target deviation, angular error, and depth precision.\nSystem Usability Scale surveys assessed user experience and cognitive workload.\nTool-tracking guidance improved performance metrics across all accuracy\nmeasures and was preferred by users in subjective evaluations.

        "summary": "Salient object detection (SOD) in optical remote sensing images (ORSIs) faces\nnumerous challenges, including significant variations in target scales and low\ncontrast between targets and the background. Existing methods based on vision\ntransformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim\nto leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively\nintegrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To\novercome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional\nperception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to\nsimultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature\nrepresentation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to\nextract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement\nof these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical\ngraph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer\ninteraction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing\nthe model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground\nand background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder\nof GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and\nmulti-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It\nperforms adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale\nconvolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing\nMamba's local modeling capability.

        "summary": "Deep learning segmentation relies heavily on labeled data, but manual\nlabeling is laborious and time-consuming, especially for volumetric images such\nas brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While recent domain-randomization\ntechniques alleviate the dependency on labeled data by synthesizing diverse\ntraining images from label maps, they offer limited anatomical variability when\nvery few label maps are available. Semi-supervised self-training addresses\nlabel scarcity by iteratively incorporating model predictions into the training\nset, enabling networks to learn from unlabeled data. In this work, we combine\ndomain randomization with self-training to train three-dimensional\nskull-stripping networks using as little as a single labeled example. First, we\nautomatically bin voxel intensities, yielding labels we use to synthesize\nimages for training an initial skull-stripping model. Second, we train a\nconvolutional autoencoder (AE) on the labeled example and use its\nreconstruction error to assess the quality of brain masks predicted for\nunlabeled data. Third, we select the top-ranking pseudo-labels to fine-tune the\nnetwork, achieving skull-stripping performance on out-of-distribution data that\napproaches models trained with more labeled images. We compare AE-based ranking\nto consistency-based ranking under test-time augmentation, finding that the AE\napproach yields a stronger correlation with segmentation accuracy. Our results\nhighlight the potential of combining domain randomization and AE-based quality\ncontrol to enable effective semi-supervised segmentation from extremely limited\nlabeled data. This strategy may ease the labeling burden that slows progress in\nstudies involving new anatomical structures or emerging imaging techniques.",

In this paper,\nwe introduce We-Math 2.0, a unified system that integrates a structured\nmathematical knowledge system, model-centric data space modeling, and a\nreinforcement learning (RL)-based training paradigm to comprehensively enhance\nthe mathematical reasoning abilities of MLLMs. The key contributions of We-Math\n2.0 are fourfold: (1) MathBook Knowledge System: We construct a five-level\nhierarchical system encompassing 491 knowledge points and 1,819 fundamental\nprinciples. (2) MathBook-Standard & Pro: We develop MathBook-Standard, a\ndataset that ensures broad conceptual coverage and flexibility through dual\nexpansion.

        "summary": "The transnational ivory trade continues to drive the decline of elephant\npopulations across Africa, and trafficking networks remain difficult to\ndisrupt. Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information\non the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and\nhandwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA\nhave identified where elephants were poached and established connections among\nshipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are\nextremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to\nobtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely\ndocumented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting\nand analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel,\nscalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085\nphotographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period\n(2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000\nindividual markings, which were then labeled and described using\nstate-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring \"signature markings\"\nthat connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were\nobserved in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these\nseizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements\nother investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are\nunavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in\nwildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting\nanalysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.",

        "title": "From Intent to Execution: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reinforcement Learning for Precise CAD Code Generation",
        "summary": "Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a vital role in engineering and\nmanufacturing, yet current CAD workflows require extensive domain expertise and\nmanual modeling effort. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have\nmade it possible to generate code from natural language, opening new\nopportunities for automating parametric 3D modeling. However, directly\ntranslating human design intent into executable CAD code remains highly\nchallenging, due to the need for logical reasoning, syntactic correctness, and\nnumerical precision. In this work, we propose CAD-RL, a multimodal\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) guided reinforcement learning post training framework\nfor CAD modeling code generation. Our method combines CoT-based Cold Start with\ngoal-driven reinforcement learning post training using three task-specific\nrewards: executability reward, geometric accuracy reward, and external\nevaluation reward. To ensure stable policy learning under sparse and\nhigh-variance reward conditions, we introduce three targeted optimization\nstrategies: Trust Region Stretch for improved exploration, Precision Token Loss\nfor enhanced dimensions parameter accuracy, and Overlong Filtering to reduce\nnoisy supervision. To support training and benchmarking, we release ExeCAD, a\nnoval dataset comprising 16,540 real-world CAD examples with paired natural\nlanguage and structured design language descriptions, executable CADQuery\nscripts, and rendered 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that CAD-RL achieves\nsignificant improvements in reasoning quality, output precision, and code\nexecutability over existing VLMs.",

        "summary": "In this work, we tackle the problem of video classincremental learning\n(VCIL). Many existing VCIL methods mitigate catastrophic forgetting by\nrehearsal training with a few temporally dense samples stored in episodic\nmemory, which is memory-inefficient. Alternatively, some methods store\ntemporally sparse samples, sacrificing essential temporal information and\nthereby resulting in inferior performance. To address this trade-off between\nmemory-efficiency and performance, we propose EpiSodic and SEmaNTIc memory\nintegrAtion for video class-incremental Learning (ESSENTIAL). ESSENTIAL\nconsists of episodic memory for storing temporally sparse features and semantic\nmemory for storing general knowledge represented by learnable prompts. We\nintroduce a novel memory retrieval (MR) module that integrates episodic memory\nand semantic prompts through cross-attention, enabling the retrieval of\ntemporally dense features from temporally sparse features. We rigorously\nvalidate ESSENTIAL on diverse datasets: UCF-101, HMDB51, and\nSomething-Something-V2 from the TCD benchmark and UCF-101, ActivityNet, and\nKinetics-400 from the vCLIMB benchmark. Remarkably, with significantly reduced\nmemory, ESSENTIAL achieves favorable performance on the benchmarks.",

Recent heatmap-based approaches can localize potential regions of\nsymmetry axes but often lack precision in identifying individual axes. In this\nwork, we propose a novel framework for axis-level detection of the two most\ncommon symmetry types-reflection and rotation-by representing them as explicit\ngeometric primitives, i.e. lines and points. Our method employs a dual-branch\narchitecture that is equivariant to the dihedral group, with each branch\nspecialized to exploit the structure of dihedral group-equivariant features for\nits respective symmetry type. For reflection symmetry, we introduce\norientational anchors, aligned with group components, to enable\norientation-specific detection, and a reflectional matching that measures\nsimilarity between patterns and their mirrored counterparts across candidate\naxes. For rotational symmetry, we propose a rotational matching that compares\npatterns at fixed angular intervals to identify rotational centers.

To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce \\textbf{EgoCross}, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the\ncross-domain generalization of MLLMs in EgocentricQA. EgoCross covers four\ndiverse and challenging domains, including surgery, industry, extreme sports,\nand animal perspective, representing realistic and high-impact application\nscenarios. It comprises approximately 1,000 QA pairs across 798 video clips,\nspanning four key QA tasks: prediction, recognition, localization, and\ncounting. Each QA pair provides both OpenQA and CloseQA formats to support\nfine-grained evaluation. Extensive experiments show that most existing MLLMs,\nwhether general-purpose or egocentric-specialized, struggle to generalize to\ndomains beyond daily life, highlighting the limitations of current models.\nFurthermore, we conduct several pilot studies, \\eg, fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning, to explore potential improvements.

Specifically, an event\ncorrection module (ECM) temporally aligns asynchronous event streams with image\nframes via optical-flow-based warping, jointly optimized with the detection\nnetwork to learn task-aware event representations. The event dynamic upsampling\nmodule (EDUM) enhances spatial resolution of event frames to match image\nstructures, ensuring precise spatiotemporal alignment. The cross-modal mamba\nfusion module (CMM) uses adaptive feature fusion with a novel interlaced\nscanning mechanism, effectively integrating complementary information for\nrobust detection. Experiments conducted on the DSEC-Det and PKU-DAVIS-SOD\ndatasets demonstrate that MCFNet significantly outperforms existing methods in\nvarious poor lighting and fast moving traffic scenarios. Notably, on the\nDSEC-Det dataset, MCFNet achieves a remarkable improvement, surpassing the best\nexisting methods by 7.4% in mAP50 and 1.7% in mAP metrics, respectively.

Existing methods typically only model\nlow-order correlations between feature nodes and perform feature extraction and\nenhancement within a single temporal scale. Although hypergraphs have been\nwidely used for high-order correlation learning, they have received limited\nattention in MIRSTD. To explore the potential of hypergraphs and enhance\nmulti-timescale feature representation, we propose HyperTea, which integrates\nglobal and local temporal perspectives to effectively model high-order\nspatiotemporal correlations of features. HyperTea consists of three modules:\nthe global temporal enhancement module (GTEM) realizes global temporal context\nenhancement through semantic aggregation and propagation; the local temporal\nenhancement module (LTEM) is designed to capture local motion patterns between\nadjacent frames and then enhance local temporal context; additionally, we\nfurther develop a temporal alignment module (TAM) to address potential\ncross-scale feature misalignment. To our best knowledge, HyperTea is the first\nwork to integrate convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs), and hypergraph neural networks (HGNNs) for MIRSTD,\nsignificantly improving detection performance.

        "summary": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show immense promise for\nachieving truly human-like interactions, progress is hindered by the lack of\nfine-grained evaluation frameworks for human-centered scenarios, encompassing\nboth the understanding of complex human intentions and the provision of\nempathetic, context-aware responses. Here we introduce HumanSense, a\ncomprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the human-centered perception and\ninteraction capabilities of MLLMs, with a particular focus on deep\nunderstanding of extended multimodal contexts and the formulation of rational\nfeedback. Our evaluation reveals that leading MLLMs still have considerable\nroom for improvement, particularly for advanced interaction-oriented tasks.\nSupplementing visual input with audio and text information yields substantial\nimprovements, and Omni-modal models show advantages on these tasks.\nFurthermore, we argue that appropriate feedback stems from a contextual\nanalysis of the interlocutor's needs and emotions, with reasoning ability\nserving as the key to unlocking it. Accordingly, we employ a multi-stage,\nmodality-progressive reinforcement learning to enhance the reasoning abilities\nof an Omni model, achieving substantial gains on evaluation results.\nAdditionally, we observe that successful reasoning processes exhibit highly\nconsistent thought patterns. By designing corresponding prompts, we also\nenhance the performance of non-reasoning models in a training-free manner.\nProject page:\n\\textcolor{brightpink}https://digital-avatar.github.io/ai/HumanSense/",

        "summary": "Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) and Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)\nrepresent two mainstream model quantization approaches. However, PTQ often\nleads to unacceptable performance degradation in quantized models, while QAT\nimposes substantial GPU memory requirements and extended training time due to\nweight fine-tuning.In this paper, we propose PTQAT, a novel general hybrid\nquantization algorithm for the efficient deployment of 3D perception networks.\nTo address the speed accuracy trade-off between PTQ and QAT, our method selects\ncritical layers for QAT fine-tuning and performs PTQ on the remaining layers.\nContrary to intuition, fine-tuning the layers with smaller output discrepancies\nbefore and after quantization, rather than those with larger discrepancies,\nactually leads to greater improvements in the model's quantization accuracy.\nThis means we better compensate for quantization errors during their\npropagation, rather than addressing them at the point where they occur. The\nproposed PTQAT achieves similar performance to QAT with more efficiency by\nfreezing nearly 50% of quantifiable layers. Additionally, PTQAT is a universal\nquantization method that supports various quantization bit widths (4 bits) as\nwell as different model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers. The\nexperimental results on nuScenes across diverse 3D perception tasks, including\nobject detection, semantic segmentation, and occupancy prediction, show that\nour method consistently outperforms QAT-only baselines. Notably, it achieves\n0.2%-0.9% NDS and 0.3%-1.0% mAP gains in object detection, 0.3%-2.0% mIoU gains\nin semantic segmentation and occupancy prediction while fine-tuning fewer\nweights.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we introduce SC-Lane, a novel slope-aware and temporally\nconsistent heightmap estimation framework for 3D lane detection. Unlike\nprevious approaches that rely on fixed slope anchors, SC-Lane adaptively\ndetermines the fusion of slope-specific height features, improving robustness\nto diverse road geometries. To achieve this, we propose a Slope-Aware Adaptive\nFeature module that dynamically predicts the appropriate weights from image\ncues for integrating multi-slope representations into a unified heightmap.\nAdditionally, a Height Consistency Module enforces temporal coherence, ensuring\nstable and accurate height estimation across consecutive frames, which is\ncrucial for real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate the effectiveness of\nSC-Lane, we employ three standardized metrics-Mean Absolute Error(MAE), Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE), and threshold-based accuracy-which, although common\nin surface and depth estimation, have been underutilized for road height\nassessment. Using the LiDAR-derived heightmap dataset introduced in prior work\n[20], we benchmark our method under these metrics, thereby establishing a\nrigorous standard for future comparisons. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane\nbenchmark demonstrate that SC-Lane significantly improves both height\nestimation and 3D lane detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance with\nan F-score of 64.3%, outperforming existing methods by a notable margin.

However, existing models often suffer from degraded\ngeneralization when deployed in real-world scenarios.

To address these\nissues, we propose a Pose-driven Quality-controlled Data Augmentation Framework\n(PQ-DAF) that leverages a vision-language model for sample filtering to\ncost-effectively expand training data and enhance cross-domain robustness.\nSpecifically, we employ a Progressive Conditional Diffusion Model (PCDMs) to\naccurately capture key driver pose features and synthesize diverse training\nexamples.

        "summary": "While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or\nexplicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit)\nlabel imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous\nobject boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present,\nsuch mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data\naugmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and\nits label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's\ngeneralization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel\naugmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to\naddress such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing\ncontrolled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving\nthe original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust\nrepresentations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves\nperformance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in\naverage on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even\nwithout bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit\nlabel noise.

        "summary": "Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) plays a critical role in\nmodern materials science, enabling direct imaging of atomic structures and\ntheir evolution under external interferences. However, interpreting\ntime-resolved STEM data remains challenging due to two entangled degradation\neffects: spatial drift caused by mechanical and thermal instabilities, and\nbeam-induced signal loss resulting from radiation damage. These factors distort\nboth geometry and intensity in complex, temporally correlated ways, making it\ndifficult for existing methods to explicitly separate their effects or model\nmaterial dynamics at atomic resolution. In this work, we present AtomDiffuser,\na time-aware degradation modeling framework that disentangles sample drift and\nradiometric attenuation by predicting an affine transformation and a spatially\nvarying decay map between any two STEM frames. Unlike traditional denoising or\nregistration pipelines, our method leverages degradation as a physically\nheuristic, temporally conditioned process, enabling interpretable structural\nevolutions across time. Trained on synthetic degradation processes,\nAtomDiffuser also generalizes well to real-world cryo-STEM data. It further\nsupports high-resolution degradation inference and drift alignment, offering\ntools for visualizing and quantifying degradation patterns that correlate with\nradiation-induced atomic instabilities.",

With large\nfoundation models (FMs) demonstrating impressive capabilities, using FMs in FL\nthrough cost-efficient adapter tuning has become a popular approach. Given the\nrapidly evolving healthcare environment, it is crucial for individual clients\nto quickly adapt to new tasks or diseases by tuning adapters while drawing upon\npast experiences. In this work, we introduce Federated Knowledge-Enhanced\nInitialization (FedKEI), a novel framework that leverages cross-client and\ncross-task transfer from past knowledge to generate informed initializations\nfor learning new tasks with adapters. FedKEI begins with a global clustering\nprocess at the server to generalize knowledge across tasks, followed by the\noptimization of aggregation weights across clusters (inter-cluster weights) and\nwithin each cluster (intra-cluster weights) to personalize knowledge transfer\nfor each new task. To facilitate more effective learning of the inter- and\nintra-cluster weights, we adopt a bi-level optimization scheme that\ncollaboratively learns the global intra-cluster weights across clients and\noptimizes the local inter-cluster weights toward each client's task objective.\nExtensive experiments on three benchmark datasets of different modalities,\nincluding dermatology, chest X-rays, and retinal OCT, demonstrate FedKEI's\nadvantage in adapting to new diseases compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "title": "VIFSS: View-Invariant and Figure Skating-Specific Pose Representation Learning for Temporal Action Segmentation",
        "summary": "Understanding human actions from videos plays a critical role across various\ndomains, including sports analytics. In figure skating, accurately recognizing\nthe type and timing of jumps a skater performs is essential for objective\nperformance evaluation. However, this task typically requires expert-level\nknowledge due to the fine-grained and complex nature of jump procedures. While\nrecent approaches have attempted to automate this task using Temporal Action\nSegmentation (TAS), there are two major limitations to TAS for figure skating:\nthe annotated data is insufficient, and existing methods do not account for the\ninherent three-dimensional aspects and procedural structure of jump actions. In\nthis work, we propose a new TAS framework for figure skating jumps that\nexplicitly incorporates both the three-dimensional nature and the semantic\nprocedure of jump movements. First, we propose a novel View-Invariant, Figure\nSkating-Specific pose representation learning approach (VIFSS) that combines\ncontrastive learning as pre-training and action classification as fine-tuning.\nFor view-invariant contrastive pre-training, we construct FS-Jump3D, the first\npublicly available 3D pose dataset specialized for figure skating jumps.\nSecond, we introduce a fine-grained annotation scheme that marks the ``entry\n(preparation)'' and ``landing'' phases, enabling TAS models to learn the\nprocedural structure of jumps. Extensive experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework. Our method achieves over 92% F1@50 on\nelement-level TAS, which requires recognizing both jump types and rotation\nlevels. Furthermore, we show that view-invariant contrastive pre-training is\nparticularly effective when fine-tuning data is limited, highlighting the\npracticality of our approach in real-world scenarios.",

        "summary": "Although appearance-based point-of-gaze (PoG) estimation has improved, the\nestimators still struggle to generalize across individuals due to personal\ndifferences. Therefore, person-specific calibration is required for accurate\nPoG estimation. However, calibrated PoG estimators are often sensitive to head\npose variations. To address this, we investigate the key factors influencing\ncalibrated estimators and explore pose-robust calibration strategies.\nSpecifically, we first construct a benchmark, MobilePoG, which includes facial\nimages from 32 individuals focusing on designated points under either fixed or\ncontinuously changing head poses. Using this benchmark, we systematically\nanalyze how the diversity of calibration points and head poses influences\nestimation accuracy. Our experiments show that introducing a wider range of\nhead poses during calibration improves the estimator's ability to handle pose\nvariation. Building on this insight, we propose a dynamic calibration strategy\nin which users fixate on calibration points while moving their phones. This\nstrategy naturally introduces head pose variation during a user-friendly and\nefficient calibration process, ultimately producing a better calibrated PoG\nestimator that is less sensitive to head pose variations than those using\nconventional calibration strategies. Codes and datasets are available at our\nproject page.",

        "summary": "Advances in surgical video analysis are transforming operating rooms into\nintelligent, data-driven environments. Computer-assisted systems support full\nsurgical workflow, from preoperative planning to intraoperative guidance and\npostoperative assessment. However, developing robust and generalizable models\nfor surgical video understanding remains challenging due to (I) annotation\nscarcity, (II) spatiotemporal complexity, and (III) domain gap across\nprocedures and institutions. This doctoral research aims to bridge the gap\nbetween deep learning-based surgical video analysis in research and its\nreal-world clinical deployment. To address the core challenge of recognizing\nsurgical phases, actions, and events, critical for analysis, I benchmarked\nstate-of-the-art neural network architectures to identify the most effective\ndesigns for each task. I further improved performance by proposing novel\narchitectures and integrating advanced modules. Given the high cost of expert\nannotations and the domain gap across surgical video sources, I focused on\nreducing reliance on labeled data. We developed semi-supervised frameworks that\nimprove model performance across tasks by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled\nsurgical video. We introduced novel semi-supervised frameworks, including DIST,\nSemiVT-Surge, and ENCORE, that achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging\nsurgical datasets by leveraging minimal labeled data and enhancing model\ntraining through dynamic pseudo-labeling. To support reproducibility and\nadvance the field, we released two multi-task datasets: GynSurg, the largest\ngynecologic laparoscopy dataset, and Cataract-1K, the largest cataract surgery\nvideo dataset. Together, this work contributes to robust, data-efficient, and\nclinically scalable solutions for surgical video analysis, laying the\nfoundation for generalizable AI systems that can meaningfully impact surgical\ncare and training.",

        "summary": "Cross-view localization aims to estimate the 3 degrees of freedom pose of a\nground-view image by registering it to aerial or satellite imagery. It is\nessential in GNSS-denied environments such as urban canyons and disaster zones.\nExisting methods either regress poses directly or align features in a shared\nbird's-eye view (BEV) space, both built upon accurate spatial correspondences\nbetween perspectives. However, these methods fail to establish strict\ncross-view correspondences, yielding only coarse or geometrically inconsistent\nmatches. Consequently, fine-grained image matching between ground and aerial\nviews remains an unsolved problem, which in turn constrains the\ninterpretability of localization results. In this paper, we revisit cross-view\nlocalization from the perspective of cross-view image matching and propose a\nnovel framework that improves both matching and localization. Specifically, we\nintroduce a Surface Model to model visible regions for accurate BEV projection,\nand a SimRefiner module to refine the similarity matrix through local-global\nresidual correction, eliminating the reliance on post-processing like RANSAC.\nTo further support research in this area, we introduce CVFM, the first\nbenchmark with 32,509 cross-view image pairs annotated with pixel-level\ncorrespondences.

We tackle this\nchallenge with a method that jointly reconstructs data across TEs, addressing\nsevere motion.

        "summary": "Land cover, both present and future, has a significant effect on several\nimportant Earth system processes. For example, impervious surfaces heat up and\nspeed up surface water runoff and reduce groundwater infiltration, with\nconcomitant effects on regional hydrology and flood risk. While regional Earth\nSystem models have increasing skill at forecasting hydrologic and atmospheric\nprocesses at high resolution in future climate scenarios, our ability to\nforecast land-use and land-cover change (LULC), a critical input to risk and\nconsequences assessment for these scenarios, has lagged behind. In this paper,\nwe propose a new paradigm exploiting Generative AI (GenAI) for land cover\nchange forecasting by framing LULC forecasting as a data synthesis problem\nconditioned on historical and auxiliary data-sources. We discuss desirable\nproperties of generative models that fundament our research premise, and\ndemonstrate the feasibility of our methodology through experiments on\nimperviousness forecasting using historical data covering the entire\nconterminous United States. Specifically, we train a diffusion model for\ndecadal forecasting of imperviousness and compare its performance to a baseline\nthat assumes no change at all. Evaluation across 12 metropolitan areas for a\nyear held-out during training indicate that for average resolutions $\\geq\n0.7\\times0.7km^2$ our model yields MAE lower than such a baseline. This finding\ncorroborates that such a generative model can capture spatiotemporal patterns\nfrom historical data that are significant for projecting future change.\nFinally, we discuss future research to incorporate auxiliary information on\nphysical properties about the Earth, as well as supporting simulation of\ndifferent scenarios by means of driver variables.",

        "summary": "Metal artifacts, caused by high-density metallic implants in computed\ntomography (CT) imaging, severely degrade image quality, complicating diagnosis\nand treatment planning. While existing deep learning algorithms have achieved\nnotable success in Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR), they often struggle to\nsuppress artifacts while preserving structural details. To address this\nchallenge, we propose FIND-Net (Fourier-Integrated Network with Dictionary\nKernels), a novel MAR framework that integrates frequency and spatial domain\nprocessing to achieve superior artifact suppression and structural\npreservation. FIND-Net incorporates Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) layers and\ntrainable Gaussian filtering, treating MAR as a hybrid task operating in both\nspatial and frequency domains. This approach enhances global contextual\nunderstanding and frequency selectivity, effectively reducing artifacts while\nmaintaining anatomical structures. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that\nFIND-Net achieves statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art\nMAR methods, with a 3.07% MAE reduction, 0.18% SSIM increase, and 0.90% PSNR\nimprovement, confirming robustness across varying artifact complexities.\nFurthermore, evaluations on real-world clinical CT scans confirm FIND-Net's\nability to minimize modifications to clean anatomical regions while effectively\nsuppressing metal-induced distortions. These findings highlight FIND-Net's\npotential for advancing MAR performance, offering superior structural\npreservation and improved clinical applicability.

This survey aims to address this gap by categorizing visual\nreasoning into five major types (relational, symbolic, temporal, causal, and\ncommonsense) and systematically examining their implementation through\narchitectures such as graph-based models, memory networks, attention\nmechanisms, and neuro-symbolic systems. We review evaluation protocols designed\nto assess functional correctness, structural consistency, and causal validity,\nand critically analyze their limitations in terms of generalizability,\nreproducibility, and explanatory power. Beyond evaluation, we identify key open\nchallenges in visual reasoning, including scalability to complex scenes, deeper\nintegration of symbolic and neural paradigms, the lack of comprehensive\nbenchmark datasets, and reasoning under weak supervision. Finally, we outline a\nforward-looking research agenda for next-generation vision systems, emphasizing\nthat bridging perception and reasoning is essential for building transparent,\ntrustworthy, and cross-domain adaptive AI systems, particularly in critical\ndomains such as autonomous driving and medical diagnostics.",

However, the lack of machine-readable floor plans\nrender large-scale interpretation both time-consuming and error-prone.\nAutomated symbol spotting offers a scalable solution by enabling the\nidentification of service key symbols directly from floor plans, supporting\nworkflows such as cost estimation, infrastructure maintenance, and regulatory\ncompliance. This work introduces a labelled Digitised Electrical Layout Plans\n(DELP) dataset comprising 45 scanned electrical layout plans annotated with\n2,450 instances across 34 distinct service key classes. A systematic evaluation\nframework is proposed using pretrained object detection models for DELP\ndataset. Among the models benchmarked, YOLOv8 achieves the highest performance\nwith a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.5\\%. Using YOLOv8, we develop\nSkeySpot, a lightweight, open-source toolkit for real-time detection,\nclassification, and quantification of electrical symbols. SkeySpot produces\nstructured, standardised outputs that can be scaled up for interoperable\nbuilding information workflows, ultimately enabling compatibility across\ndownstream applications and regulatory platforms. By lowering dependency on\nproprietary CAD systems and reducing manual annotation effort, this approach\nmakes the digitisation of electrical layouts more accessible to small and\nmedium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the construction industry, while supporting\nbroader goals of standardisation, interoperability, and sustainability in the\nbuilt environment.",

In this work, we introduce\nContrastive Residual Injection and Semantic Prompting (CRISP), an earlier\nattempt tailored to address the instance-wise, category-wise, and task-wise\nconfusion in continual video instance segmentation. For instance-wise learning,\nwe model instance tracking and construct instance correlation loss, which\nemphasizes the correlation with the prior query space while strengthening the\nspecificity of the current task query. For category-wise learning, we build an\nadaptive residual semantic prompt (ARSP) learning framework, which constructs a\nlearnable semantic residual prompt pool generated by category text and uses an\nadjustive query-prompt matching mechanism to build a mapping relationship\nbetween the query of the current task and the semantic residual prompt.\nMeanwhile, a semantic consistency loss based on the contrastive learning is\nintroduced to maintain semantic coherence between object queries and residual\nprompts during incremental training. For task-wise learning, to ensure the\ncorrelation at the inter-task level within the query space, we introduce a\nconcise yet powerful initialization strategy for incremental prompts. Extensive\nexperiments on YouTube-VIS-2019 and YouTube-VIS-2021 datasets demonstrate that\nCRISP significantly outperforms existing continual segmentation methods in the\nlong-term continual video instance segmentation task, avoiding catastrophic\nforgetting and effectively improving segmentation and classification\nperformance.

        "summary": "As the oldest mature writing system, Oracle Bone Script (OBS) has long posed\nsignificant challenges for archaeological decipherment due to its rarity,\nabstractness, and pictographic diversity. Current deep learning-based methods\nhave made exciting progress on the OBS decipherment task, but existing\napproaches often ignore the intricate connections between glyphs and the\nsemantics of OBS. This results in limited generalization and interpretability,\nespecially when addressing zero-shot settings and undeciphered OBS. To this\nend, we propose an interpretable OBS decipherment method based on Large\nVision-Language Models, which synergistically combines radical analysis and\npictograph-semantic understanding to bridge the gap between glyphs and meanings\nof OBS. Specifically, we propose a progressive training strategy that guides\nthe model from radical recognition and analysis to pictographic analysis and\nmutual analysis, thus enabling reasoning from glyph to meaning. We also design\na Radical-Pictographic Dual Matching mechanism informed by the analysis\nresults, significantly enhancing the model's zero-shot decipherment\nperformance. To facilitate model training, we propose the Pictographic\nDecipherment OBS Dataset, which comprises 47,157 Chinese characters annotated\nwith OBS images and pictographic analysis texts. Experimental results on public\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art Top-10\naccuracy and superior zero-shot decipherment capabilities. More importantly,\nour model delivers logical analysis processes, possibly providing\narchaeologically valuable reference results for undeciphered OBS, and thus has\npotential applications in digital humanities and historical research. The\ndataset and code will be released in https://github.com/PKXX1943/PD-OBS.",

In this study, we evaluated GPT-4o, GPT-5-nano, GPT-5-mini, and\nGPT-5 on a curated brain tumor VQA benchmark derived from 3 Brain Tumor\nSegmentation (BraTS) datasets - glioblastoma (GLI), meningioma (MEN), and brain\nmetastases (MET).

        "title": "Cooperative Face Liveness Detection from Optical Flow",
        "summary": "In this work, we proposed a novel cooperative video-based face liveness\ndetection method based on a new user interaction scenario where participants\nare instructed to slowly move their frontal-oriented face closer to the camera.\nThis controlled approaching face protocol, combined with optical flow analysis,\nrepresents the core innovation of our approach. By designing a system where\nusers follow this specific movement pattern, we enable robust extraction of\nfacial volume information through neural optical flow estimation, significantly\nimproving discrimination between genuine faces and various presentation attacks\n(including printed photos, screen displays, masks, and video replays). Our\nmethod processes both the predicted optical flows and RGB frames through a\nneural classifier, effectively leveraging spatial-temporal features for more\nreliable liveness detection compared to passive methods.",

        "title": "From Diagnosis to Improvement: Probing Spatio-Physical Reasoning in Vision Language Models",
        "summary": "Spatio-physical reasoning, a foundation capability for understanding the real\nphysics world, is a critical step towards building robust world models. While\nrecent vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable progress in\nspecialized domains like multimodal mathematics and pure spatial understanding,\ntheir capability for spatio-physical reasoning remains largely unexplored. This\npaper provides a comprehensive diagnostic analysis of mainstream VLMs,\nrevealing that current models perform inadequately on this crucial task.\nFurther detailed analysis shows that this underperformance is largely\nattributable to biases caused by human-like prior and a lack of deep reasoning.\nTo address these challenges, we apply supervised fine-tuning followed by\nrule-based reinforcement learning to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, resulting in significant\nimprovements in spatio-physical reasoning capabilities and surpassing leading\nproprietary models. Nevertheless, despite this success, the model's\ngeneralization to new physics scenarios remains limited -- underscoring the\npressing need for new approaches in spatio-physical reasoning.",
