        "summary": "While the Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining(CLIP) model has achieved\nremarkable success in a variety of downstream vison language understanding\ntasks, enhancing its capability for fine-grained image-text alignment remains\nan active research focus. To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy\nof explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,\ne.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local\nregions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual\ndescriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language\nalignment. However, the inherent token length limitation of CLIP's text encoder\nfundamentally limits CLIP to process more granular textual information embedded\nin long text sequences. To synergistically leverage the advantages of enhancing\nboth visual and textual content processing granularity, we propose PixCLIP, a\nnovel framework designed to concurrently accommodate visual prompt inputs and\nprocess lengthy textual descriptions. Specifically, we first establish an\nautomated annotation pipeline capable of generating pixel-level localized,\nlong-form textual descriptions for images. Utilizing this pipeline, we\nconstruct LongGRIT, a high-quality dataset comprising nearly 1.5 million\nsamples. Secondly, we replace CLIP's original text encoder with the LLM and\npropose a three-branch pixel-text alignment learning framework, facilitating\nfine-grained alignment between image regions and corresponding textual\ndescriptions at arbitrary granularity. Experiments demonstrate that PixCLIP\nshowcases breakthroughs in pixel-level interaction and handling long-form\ntexts, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

        "summary": "Feed-forward 3D reconstruction for autonomous driving has advanced rapidly,\nyet existing methods struggle with the joint challenges of sparse,\nnon-overlapping camera views and complex scene dynamics. We present UniSplat, a\ngeneral feed-forward framework that learns robust dynamic scene reconstruction\nthrough unified latent spatio-temporal fusion. UniSplat constructs a 3D latent\nscaffold, a structured representation that captures geometric and semantic\nscene context by leveraging pretrained foundation models. To effectively\nintegrate information across spatial views and temporal frames, we introduce an\nefficient fusion mechanism that operates directly within the 3D scaffold,\nenabling consistent spatio-temporal alignment. To ensure complete and detailed\nreconstructions, we design a dual-branch decoder that generates dynamic-aware\nGaussians from the fused scaffold by combining point-anchored refinement with\nvoxel-based generation, and maintain a persistent memory of static Gaussians to\nenable streaming scene completion beyond current camera coverage. Extensive\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that UniSplat achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, while providing robust\nand high-quality renderings even for viewpoints outside the original camera\ncoverage.",

        "summary": "\"Thinking with Text\" and \"Thinking with Images\" paradigm significantly\nimprove the reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) and Vision\nLanguage Models (VLMs). However, these paradigms have inherent limitations. (1)\nImages capture only single moments and fail to represent dynamic processes or\ncontinuous changes, and (2) The separation of text and vision as distinct\nmodalities, hindering unified multimodal understanding and generation. To\novercome these limitations, we introduce \"Thinking with Video\", a new paradigm\nthat leverages video generation models, such as Sora-2, to bridge visual and\ntextual reasoning in a unified temporal framework. To support this exploration,\nwe developed the Video Thinking Benchmark (VideoThinkBench). VideoThinkBench\nencompasses two task categories: (1) vision-centric tasks (e.g., Eyeballing\nPuzzles), and (2) text-centric tasks (e.g., subsets of GSM8K, MMMU). Our\nevaluation establishes Sora-2 as a capable reasoner. On vision-centric tasks,\nSora-2 is generally comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) VLMs, and even\nsurpasses VLMs on several tasks, such as Eyeballing Games. On text-centric\ntasks, Sora-2 achieves 92% accuracy on MATH, and 75.53% accuracy on MMMU.\nFurthermore, we systematically analyse the source of these abilities. We also\nfind that self-consistency and in-context learning can improve Sora-2's\nperformance. In summary, our findings demonstrate that the video generation\nmodel is the potential unified multimodal understanding and generation model,\npositions \"thinking with video\" as a unified multimodal reasoning paradigm.",

However, current VLA models typically\ncontain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data\npretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as\nlimited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training\nparadigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language\nbackbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.\nIn this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces\ncomputation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong\nperformance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native\nmultimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated\ndiffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together\nforming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training\nparadigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the\nrepresentations of the VLM. Notably, with only 0.77 billion parameters, Evo-1\nachieves state-of-the-art results on the Meta-World and RoboTwin suite,\nsurpassing the previous best models by 12.4% and 6.9%, respectively, and also\nattains a competitive result of 94.8% on LIBERO.

The\nParkland Grading Scale (PGS) provides a clinically validated framework for\nstratifying inflammation severity; however, its automation in surgical videos\nremains largely unexplored, particularly in realistic scenarios where complete\nvideos must be analyzed without prior manual curation. Methods: In this work,\nwe introduce STC-Net, a novel framework for SingleTimestamp-based Complexity\nestimation in LC via the PGS, designed to operate under weak temporal\nsupervision. Unlike prior methods limited to static images or manually trimmed\nclips, STC-Net operates directly on full videos. It jointly performs temporal\nlocalization and grading through a localization, window proposal, and grading\nmodule. We introduce a novel loss formulation combining hard and soft\nlocalization objectives and background-aware grading supervision. Results:\nEvaluated on a private dataset of 1,859 LC videos, STC-Net achieves an accuracy\nof 62.11% and an F1-score of 61.42%, outperforming non-localized baselines by\nover 10% in both metrics and highlighting the effectiveness of weak supervision\nfor surgical complexity assessment. Conclusion: STC-Net demonstrates a scalable\nand effective approach for automated PGS-based surgical complexity estimation\nfrom full LC videos, making it promising for post-operative analysis and\nsurgical training.",

Motivated by this, we propose a new evaluation framework comprising 8\nmetrics related to three dimensions (i) quality, (ii) naturalness, and (iii)\nsynchronization. In selecting the metrics, we place emphasis on efficiency, as\nwell as alignment with human preferences.

Our extensive experiments on 85,000 videos generated by\n17 state-of-the-art models suggest that while many algorithms excel in lip\nsynchronization, they face challenges with generating expressiveness and\nartifact-free details. These videos were generated based on a novel real\ndataset, that we have curated, in order to mitigate bias of training data.

Once a network has been trained, however, its\nmemory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we\nfocus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.\nWhereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing\nan isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use\ndata-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we\nminimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed\nas $\\lVert (W - \\widetilde{W}) \\Sigma^{1/2}\\rVert_F$ where $\\Sigma^{1/2}$ is\nthe square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,\n$\\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new\nalternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor\ndecompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike\nconventional compression pipelines, which almost always require\npost-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves\ncompetitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same\ncovariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only\na minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training\ndataset is unavailable.

        "summary": "Analyzing octopuses in their natural habitats is challenging due to their\ncamouflage capability, rapid changes in skin texture and color, non-rigid body\ndeformations, and frequent occlusions, all of which are compounded by variable\nunderwater lighting and turbidity. Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated\ndatasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised\nAI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative\nbaseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained\nYOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate\nthe initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data\nfor the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by\nproviding a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further\nmanual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal\nconsistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively\nevaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of\nground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,\nand test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory\nperformance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted\napproach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods\nof complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually\nprompted model fails. By reducing the need for manual analysis in real-world\nscenarios, this work provides a practical tool that paves the way for more\nefficient behavioral studies of wild cephalopods.",

Existing solutions often apply\nend-to-end imitation learning with Vision-Language Action (VLA) models or\nsymbolic approaches with Action Model Learning (AML). On the one hand, current\nVLA models are limited by the lack of high-level symbolic planning, which\nhinders their abilities in long-horizon tasks.

In this\npaper we present a new neuro-symbolic approach, GraSP-VLA, a framework that\nuses a Continuous Scene Graph representation to generate a symbolic\nrepresentation of human demonstrations.

Importantly, the focus of this work is not on training deep\nlearning models for image processing but on using existing open source models\nto extract deep features from imaging data.\n  Significance The tutorial provides MATLAB code tutorial demonstrations,\nshowcasing the processing of imaging data from various imaging modalities\ncommonly encountered in analytical chemistry.

Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nrepresentations, which project multi-sensor data into a top-down spatial\nformat, have emerged as a powerful approach for robust perception. Although\nBEV-based fusion architectures have demonstrated strong performance through\nmultimodal integration, the effects of sensor occlusions, caused by\nenvironmental conditions such as fog, haze, or physical obstructions, on 3D\ndetection accuracy remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate the\nimpact of occlusions on both camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)\noutputs using the BEVFusion architecture, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset.\nDetection performance is measured using mean Average Precision (mAP) and the\nnuScenes Detection Score (NDS). Our results show that moderate camera\nocclusions lead to a 41.3% drop in mAP (from 35.6% to 20.9%) when detection is\nbased only on the camera. On the other hand, LiDAR sharply drops in performance\nonly under heavy occlusion, with mAP falling by 47.3% (from 64.7% to 34.1%),\nwith a severe impact on long-range detection. In fused settings, the effect\ndepends on which sensor is occluded: occluding the camera leads to a minor 4.1%\ndrop (from 68.5% to 65.7%), while occluding LiDAR results in a larger 26.8%\ndrop (to 50.1%), revealing the model's stronger reliance on LiDAR for the task\nof 3D object detection.

        "summary": "Most text-to-video(T2V) diffusion models depend on pre-trained text encoders\nfor semantic alignment, yet they often fail to maintain video quality when\nprovided with concise prompts rather than well-designed ones. The primary issue\nlies in their limited textual semantics understanding. Moreover, these text\nencoders cannot rephrase prompts online to better align with user intentions,\nwhich limits both the scalability and usability of the models, To address these\nchallenges, we introduce RISE-T2V, which uniquely integrates the processes of\nprompt rephrasing and semantic feature extraction into a single and seamless\nstep instead of two separate steps. RISE-T2V is universal and can be applied to\nvarious pre-trained LLMs and video diffusion models(VDMs), significantly\nenhancing their capabilities for T2V tasks. We propose an innovative module\ncalled the Rephrasing Adapter, enabling diffusion models to utilize text hidden\nstates during the next token prediction of the LLM as a condition for video\ngeneration. By employing a Rephrasing Adapter, the video generation model can\nimplicitly rephrase basic prompts into more comprehensive representations that\nbetter match the user's intent. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful\ncapabilities of LLMs to enable video generation models to accomplish a broader\nrange of T2V tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE-T2V is a\nversatile framework applicable to different video diffusion model\narchitectures, significantly enhancing the ability of T2V models to generate\nhigh-quality videos that align with user intent.

        "summary": "Herbicide field trials require accurate identification of plant species and\nassessment of herbicide-induced damage across diverse environments. While\ngeneral-purpose vision foundation models have shown promising results in\ncomplex visual domains, their performance can be limited in agriculture, where\nfine-grained distinctions between species and damage types are critical.\n  In this work, we adapt a general-purpose vision foundation model to herbicide\ntrial characterization. Trained using a self-supervised learning approach on a\nlarge, curated agricultural dataset, the model learns rich and transferable\nrepresentations optimized for herbicide trials images.\n  Our domain-specific model significantly outperforms the best general-purpose\nfoundation model in both species identification (F1 score improvement from 0.91\nto 0.94) and damage classification (from 0.26 to 0.33). Under unseen conditions\n(new locations and other time), it achieves even greater gains (species\nidentification from 0.56 to 0.66; damage classification from 0.17 to 0.27). In\ndomain-shift scenarios, such as drone imagery, it maintains strong performance\n(species classification from 0.49 to 0.60).\n  Additionally, we show that domain-specific pretraining enhances segmentation\naccuracy, particularly in low-annotation regimes. An annotation-efficiency\nanalysis reveals that, under unseen conditions, the domain-specific model\nachieves 5.4% higher F1 score than the general-purpose model, while using 80%\nfewer labeled samples.\n  These results demonstrate the generalization capabilities of domain-specific\nfoundation models and their potential to significantly reduce manual annotation\nefforts, offering a scalable and automated solution for herbicide trial\nanalysis.",

To address\nthese challenges, we propose a DINOv2-Driven Gait Representation Learning\n(DinoGRL) framework that leverages the rich visual priors of DINOv2 to learn\ngait features complementary to appearance cues, facilitating robust\nsequence-level representations for cross-modal retrieval.

Recent studies suggest that\ndiffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,\nknown as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent\nrepresentations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a\nsignal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates\nclosed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the\nlearned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.\nOperating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates\npartial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A\ntemporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a\nfeature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables\ntransparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro\nAUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under\npost-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong\nseparability between known and unseen generators.

In this\nstudy, we investigate the adaptation of Sapiens, a human-centric foundation\nmodel designed for pose estimation, to medical imaging through multi-dataset\npretraining, establishing a new state of the art across multiple datasets.

In digital\npathology, registration enables direct comparison and integration of\ninformation from different stains or imaging modalities, sup-porting\napplications such as biomarker analysis and tissue reconstruction. Accurate\nregistration of images from different modalities is an essential step in\ndigital pathology. In this study, we investigated how various color\ntransformation techniques affect image registration between hematoxylin and\neosin (H&E) stained images and non-linear multimodal images. We used a dataset\nof 20 tissue sample pairs, with each pair undergoing several preprocessing\nsteps, including different color transformation (CycleGAN, Macenko, Reinhard,\nVahadane), inversion, contrast adjustment, intensity normalization, and\ndenoising. All images were registered using the VALIS registration method,\nwhich first applies rigid registration and then performs non-rigid registration\nin two steps on both low and high-resolution images. Registration performance\nwas evaluated using the relative Target Registration Error (rTRE). We reported\nthe median of median rTRE values (MMrTRE) and the average of median rTRE values\n(AMrTRE) for each method.

In this paper, we study how to enable\ncomputer-use agents to learn from online videos at inference time effectively.\nWe propose a framework that retrieves and filters tutorial videos, converts\nthem into structured demonstration trajectories, and dynamically selects\ntrajectories as in-context guidance during execution. Particularly, using a\nVLM, we infer UI actions, segment videos into short subsequences of actions,\nand assign each subsequence a textual objective. At inference time, a two-stage\nselection mechanism dynamically chooses a single trajectory to add in context\nat each step, focusing the agent on the most helpful local guidance for its\nnext decision. Experiments on two widely used benchmarks show that our\nframework consistently outperforms strong base agents and variants that use\nonly textual tutorials or transcripts.

        "summary": "Accurate perception of the marine environment through robust multi-object\ntracking (MOT) is essential for ensuring safe vessel navigation and effective\nmaritime surveillance. However, the complicated maritime environment often\ncauses camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant\nchallenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient\nDual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the\nframework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an\nobject detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated\nbranch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible\nColumnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to\nleverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset\ndemonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT\nattains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while\nmaintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.\nCode is available at:\nhttps://github.com/BiscuitsLzy/DMSORT-An-efficient-parallel-maritime-multi-object-tracking-architecture-.",

However, existing specialized methods primarily focus on generic\nsynthesis and lack mechanisms for precise control over sketch styles. In this\nwork, we propose a training-free framework based on diffusion models that\nenables explicit style guidance via textual prompts and referenced style\nsketches. Unlike previous style transfer methods that overwrite key and value\nmatrices in self-attention, we incorporate the reference features as auxiliary\ninformation with linear smoothing and leverage a style-content guidance\nmechanism. This design effectively reduces content leakage from reference\nsketches and enhances synthesis quality, especially in cases with low\nstructural similarity between reference and target sketches. Furthermore, we\nextend our framework to support controllable multi-style generation by\nintegrating features from multiple reference sketches, coordinated via a joint\nAdaIN module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves\nhigh-quality sketch generation with accurate style alignment and improved\nflexibility in style control.

        "summary": "In this paper, we propose Tortoise and Hare Guidance (THG), a training-free\nstrategy that accelerates diffusion sampling while maintaining high-fidelity\ngeneration. We demonstrate that the noise estimate and the additional guidance\nterm exhibit markedly different sensitivity to numerical error by reformulating\nthe classifier-free guidance (CFG) ODE as a multirate system of ODEs. Our\nerror-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust\nto approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers\nfail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the\ncomputation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with\nthe tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the\nadditional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.\nWe also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively\nselects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large\nextrapolation spans. THG reduces the number of function evaluations (NFE) by up\nto 30% with virtually no loss in generation fidelity ($\\Delta$ImageReward\n$\\leq$ 0.032) and outperforms state-of-the-art CFG-based training-free\naccelerators under identical computation budgets.

To address\nthis issue, we propose SpatialLock, a novel framework that leverages perception\nsignals and grounding information to jointly control the generation of spatial\nlocations. SpatialLock incorporates two components: Position-Engaged Injection\n(PoI) and Position-Guided Learning (PoG).

CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local\nfeature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.\nTransformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but\nare inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we\nintroduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function\nbased Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By\nleveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the\nKolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the\ninefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and\ndata-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in\nparameter count compared to SwinUNETR.

Existing approaches primarily align neural activity\ndirectly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to\ncapture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep\nrobustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first\nend-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain\nalignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and\nlinguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain\nrepresentations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned\nvisual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual\nreliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel\nuncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during\nalignment. By leveraging learnable language-anchored semantic matrices to\nenhance cross-modal correlations and employing a two-stage training strategy of\nsingle-modality pretraining followed by multimodal fine-tuning, Bratrix-M\nimproves alignment precision. Extensive experiments on EEG, MEG, and fMRI\nbenchmarks demonstrate that Bratrix improves retrieval, reconstruction, and\ncaptioning performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, specifically\nsurpassing 14.3% in 200-way EEG retrieval task.

However, PPG signal\nquality is challenged by motion artifacts, illumination changes, and\ninter-subject physiological variability, making robust feature extraction and\nclassification crucial. This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective\nbiometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from\nlow-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings\nfrom 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The\nraw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline\ndrift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude\nnormalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG\nsegment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the\nContinuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient\ncardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed\nCVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision\nTransformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long\nShort-Term Memory network (LSTM). The experimental results on 46 subjects\ndemonstrate an authentication accuracy of 98%, validating the robustness of the\nmodel to noise and variability between subjects. Due to its efficiency,\nscalability, and inherent liveness detection capability, the proposed system is\nwell-suited for real-world mobile and embedded biometric security applications.",

        "summary": "Humans can quickly and effortlessly extract a variety of information about\nothers' social interactions from visual input, ranging from visuospatial cues\nlike whether two people are facing each other to higher-level information. Yet,\nthe computations supporting these abilities remain poorly understood, and\nsocial interaction recognition continues to challenge even the most advanced AI\nvision systems. Here, we hypothesized that humans rely on 3D visuospatial pose\ninformation to make social interaction judgments, which is absent in most AI\nvision models. To test this, we combined state-of-the-art pose and depth\nestimation algorithms to extract 3D joint positions of people in short video\nclips depicting everyday human actions and compared their ability to predict\nhuman social interaction judgments with current AI vision models. Strikingly,\n3D joint positions outperformed most current AI vision models, revealing that\nkey social information is available in explicit body position but not in the\nlearned features of most vision models, including even the layer-wise\nembeddings of the pose models used to extract joint positions. To uncover the\ncritical pose features humans use to make social judgments, we derived a\ncompact set of 3D social pose features describing only the 3D position and\ndirection of faces in the videos. We found that these minimal descriptors\nmatched the predictive strength of the full set of 3D joints and significantly\nimproved the performance of off-the-shelf AI vision models when combined with\ntheir embeddings. Moreover, the degree to which 3D social pose features were\nrepresented in each off-the-shelf AI vision model predicted the model's ability\nto match human social judgments. Together, our findings provide strong evidence\nthat human social scene understanding relies on explicit representations of 3D\npose and can be supported by simple, structured visuospatial primitives.",

        "summary": "Modern scene reconstruction methods are able to accurately recover 3D\nsurfaces that are visible in one or more images. However, this leads to\nincomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress\nhas been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using\ngenerative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors\nand ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements\nshould be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,\nrepetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable. In this\nwork, we present a synthetic dataset -- Room Envelopes -- that facilitates\nprogress on this task by providing a set of RGB images and two associated\npointmaps for each image: one capturing the visible surface and one capturing\nthe first surface once fittings and fixtures are removed, that is, the\nstructural layout. As we show, this enables direct supervision for feed-forward\nmonocular geometry estimators that predict both the first visible surface and\nthe first layout surface. This confers an understanding of the scene's extent,\nas well as the shape and location of its objects.",

        "summary": "Unknown anomaly detection in medical imaging remains a fundamental challenge\ndue to the scarcity of labeled anomalies and the high cost of expert\nsupervision. We introduce an unsupervised, oracle-free framework that\nincrementally expands a trusted set of normal samples without any anomaly\nlabels. Starting from a small, verified seed of normal images, our method\nalternates between lightweight adapter updates and uncertainty-gated sample\nadmission. A frozen pretrained vision backbone is augmented with tiny\nconvolutional adapters, ensuring rapid domain adaptation with negligible\ncomputational overhead. Extracted embeddings are stored in a compact coreset\nenabling efficient k-nearest neighbor anomaly (k-NN) scoring. Safety during\nincremental expansion is enforced by dual probabilistic gates, a sample is\nadmitted into the normal memory only if its distance to the existing coreset\nlies within a calibrated z-score threshold, and its SWAG-based epistemic\nuncertainty remains below a seed-calibrated bound. This mechanism prevents\ndrift and false inclusions without relying on generative reconstruction or\nreplay buffers. Empirically, our system steadily refines the notion of\nnormality as unlabeled data arrive, producing substantial gains over baselines.\nOn COVID-CXR, ROC-AUC improves from 0.9489 to 0.9982 (F1: 0.8048 to 0.9746); on\nPneumonia CXR, ROC-AUC rises from 0.6834 to 0.8968; and on Brain MRI ND-5,\nROC-AUC increases from 0.6041 to 0.7269 and PR-AUC from 0.7539 to 0.8211.

To assess the effectiveness of this new representation, we\nconducted a comparative analysis between the original dataset and its variant\nusing a VGG16 model.

        "summary": "Accurate geometric modeling of the aortic valve from 3D CT images is\nessential for biomechanical analysis and patient-specific simulations to assess\nvalve health or make a preoperative plan. However, it remains challenging to\ngenerate aortic valve meshes with both high-quality and consistency across\ndifferent patients. Traditional approaches often produce triangular meshes with\nirregular topologies, which can result in poorly shaped elements and\ninconsistent correspondence due to inter-patient anatomical variation. In this\nwork, we address these challenges by introducing a template-fitting pipeline\nwith deep neural networks to generate structured quad (i.e., quadrilateral)\nmeshes from 3D CT images to represent aortic valve geometries. By remeshing\naortic valves of all patients with a common quad mesh template, we ensure a\nuniform mesh topology with consistent node-to-node and element-to-element\ncorrespondence across patients. This consistency enables us to simplify the\nlearning objective of the deep neural networks, by employing a loss function\nwith only two terms (i.e., a geometry reconstruction term and a smoothness\nregularization term), which is sufficient to preserve mesh smoothness and\nelement quality. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach\nproduces high-quality aortic valve surface meshes with improved smoothness and\nshape quality, while requiring fewer explicit regularization terms compared to\nthe traditional methods. These results highlight that using structured quad\nmeshes for the template and neural network training not only ensures mesh\ncorrespondence and quality but also simplifies the training process, thus\nenhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of aortic valve modeling.",

Using the DroneTrashNet dataset,\nwe demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and mean average\nprecision (mAP), while achieving low latency and compact model size suitable\nfor deployment on resource-constrained aerial drones. Benchmarking our model\nagainst state-of-the-art lightweight YOLO variants further highlights its\noptimal balance of accuracy and efficiency. Our results validate the\neffectiveness of combining data-centric and model-centric enhancements for\nrobust, real-time waste detection in desert environments.",

        "title": "Investigating Robot Control Policy Learning for Autonomous X-ray-guided Spine Procedures",
        "summary": "Imitation learning-based robot control policies are enjoying renewed interest\nin video-based robotics. However, it remains unclear whether this approach\napplies to X-ray-guided procedures, such as spine instrumentation. This is\nbecause interpretation of multi-view X-rays is complex. We examine\nopportunities and challenges for imitation policy learning in bi-plane-guided\ncannula insertion. We develop an in silico sandbox for scalable, automated\nsimulation of X-ray-guided spine procedures with a high degree of realism. We\ncurate a dataset of correct trajectories and corresponding bi-planar X-ray\nsequences that emulate the stepwise alignment of providers. We then train\nimitation learning policies for planning and open-loop control that iteratively\nalign a cannula solely based on visual information. This precisely controlled\nsetup offers insights into limitations and capabilities of this method. Our\npolicy succeeded on the first attempt in 68.5% of cases, maintaining safe\nintra-pedicular trajectories across diverse vertebral levels. The policy\ngeneralized to complex anatomy, including fractures, and remained robust to\nvaried initializations. Rollouts on real bi-planar X-rays further suggest that\nthe model can produce plausible trajectories, despite training exclusively in\nsimulation. While these preliminary results are promising, we also identify\nlimitations, especially in entry point precision. Full closed-look control will\nrequire additional considerations around how to provide sufficiently frequent\nfeedback. With more robust priors and domain knowledge, such models may provide\na foundation for future efforts toward lightweight and CT-free robotic\nintra-operative spinal navigation.",

        "title": "Computed Tomography (CT)-derived Cardiovascular Flow Estimation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks Improves with Sinogram-based Training: A Simulation Study",
        "summary": "Background: Non-invasive imaging-based assessment of blood flow plays a\ncritical role in evaluating heart function and structure. Computed Tomography\n(CT) is a widely-used imaging modality that can robustly evaluate\ncardiovascular anatomy and function, but direct methods to estimate blood flow\nvelocity from movies of contrast evolution have not been developed.\n  Purpose: This study evaluates the impact of CT imaging on Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINN)-based flow estimation and proposes an improved\nframework, SinoFlow, which uses sinogram data directly to estimate blood flow.\n  Methods: We generated pulsatile flow fields in an idealized 2D vessel\nbifurcation using computational fluid dynamics and simulated CT scans with\nvarying gantry rotation speeds, tube currents, and pulse mode imaging settings.\nWe compared the performance of PINN-based flow estimation using reconstructed\nimages (ImageFlow) to SinoFlow.\n  Results: SinoFlow significantly improved flow estimation performance by\navoiding propagating errors introduced by filtered backprojection. SinoFlow was\nrobust across all tested gantry rotation speeds and consistently produced lower\nmean squared error and velocity errors than ImageFlow. Additionally, SinoFlow\nwas compatible with pulsed-mode imaging and maintained higher accuracy with\nshorter pulse widths.\n  Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of SinoFlow for CT-based\nflow estimation, providing a more promising approach for non-invasive blood\nflow assessment. The findings aim to inform future applications of PINNs to CT\nimages and provide a solution for image-based estimation, with reasonable\nacquisition parameters yielding accurate flow estimates.",

        "summary": "Deep learned (DL) models for image recognition have been shown to fail to\ngeneralize to data from different devices, populations, etc. COVID-19 detection\nfrom Chest X-rays (CXRs), in particular, has been shown to fail to generalize\nto out-of-distribution (OOD) data from new clinical sources not covered in the\ntraining set. This occurs because models learn to exploit shortcuts -\nsource-specific artifacts that do not translate to new distributions - rather\nthan reasonable biomarkers to maximize performance on in-distribution (ID)\ndata. Rendering the models more robust to distribution shifts, our study\ninvestigates the use of fundamental noise injection techniques (Gaussian,\nSpeckle, Poisson, and Salt and Pepper) during training. Our empirical results\ndemonstrate that this technique can significantly reduce the performance gap\nbetween ID and OOD evaluation from 0.10-0.20 to 0.01-0.06, based on results\naveraged over ten random seeds across key metrics such as AUC, F1, accuracy,\nrecall and specificity.

        "title": "SILVI: Simple Interface for Labeling Video Interactions",
        "summary": "Computer vision methods are increasingly used for the automated analysis of\nlarge volumes of video data collected through camera traps, drones, or direct\nobservations of animals in the wild. While recent advances have focused\nprimarily on detecting individual actions, much less work has addressed the\ndetection and annotation of interactions -- a crucial aspect for understanding\nsocial and individualized animal behavior. Existing open-source annotation\ntools support either behavioral labeling without localization of individuals,\nor localization without the capacity to capture interactions. To bridge this\ngap, we present SILVI, an open-source labeling software that integrates both\nfunctionalities. SILVI enables researchers to annotate behaviors and\ninteractions directly within video data, generating structured outputs suitable\nfor training and validating computer vision models. By linking behavioral\necology with computer vision, SILVI facilitates the development of automated\napproaches for fine-grained behavioral analyses. Although developed primarily\nin the context of animal behavior, SILVI could be useful more broadly to\nannotate human interactions in other videos that require extracting dynamic\nscene graphs.

        "title": "Disentangled Concepts Speak Louder Than Words:Explainable Video Action Recognition",
        "summary": "Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle\nhow movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,\nexisting methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it\nunclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based\napproaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit\nnature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based\nExplainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions\nthrough disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We\ndefine motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large\nlanguage model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an\nante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these\nconcepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101\n-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with\ncompetitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE\nthrough a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial\nfor model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.",
