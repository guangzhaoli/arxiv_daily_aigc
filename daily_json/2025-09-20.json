        "summary": "4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving\ndue to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement\ncapability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on\npillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to\nonly a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded\nrepresentation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes\nindependently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their\ninference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the\nreal-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these\nlimitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely\nRadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and\ndistributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding\nboxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed\nto transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and\nemploys the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization,\nyielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to\nthe optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of\n3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts\nbounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to\nenable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on\nTJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves\nstate-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster\ninference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous\ndriving.",

        "summary": "Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation\nby supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings,\nusing a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt\nand ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two\nfundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads\nto coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2)\n2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in\ngeometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object\nscenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D\ngeneration framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into\nthe SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard\ntext-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded\nsupervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their\ninherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which\nsignificantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves\nrelational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the\nopen-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.\nExperiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D\nsignificantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity,\ngeometric coherence, and spatial correctness.",

This design significantly enhances both\ntemporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene\nunderstanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves\nspatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations\nfor future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.\nAdditionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects\nspatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on\ndynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.\nExtensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in\naction-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving\ngeneration quality with 4.4$\\times$ faster inference.

        "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities\nbut remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial\nattacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world\napplications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the\nfactual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through\ntest-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models\n(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act\nloop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating\ncross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without\naccess to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate\nreasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed\nprimarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent\nadversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense\nmechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on\nhallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,\nand (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE\nhallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\\%\nto +40.67\\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE,\nORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\\% across LVLMs. When combined\nwith defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further\nimproves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\\% to\n+48.00\\% across evaluation metrics.

CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was\nrestricted to a pair of domains.

Style mapping via\nreference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of\nStarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and\nneed an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to\ntranslate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation.

        "summary": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but\ntheir practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior\nefforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or\nreducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the\npossibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process.\nIn this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework\nbased on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution\noutputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine\nimages from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed\narchitecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even\nsuperior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is\napplicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive\nexperiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across\nCIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our\nmethod. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and\nsettings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional\nCIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional\nCIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an\nFID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1\nproduces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together\nwith substantial efficiency gains.",

        "summary": "Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in\nautonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains\nchallenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but\ndepth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well\nas the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome\nthese limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that\nunifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end\npipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via\ndual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional\nalignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine\nregistration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel\ncorrespondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction\nmodeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise\nregistration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient\nnormalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence\nrefinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nCrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry\nbenchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and\nrobustness.",

        "summary": "We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth\nmeasurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors.\nThese sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but\nimage a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data\nin the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes\nrich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse\nmeasurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few\nmeasurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple\nparametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a\nknown object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both\nfeed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering\nwithin an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter\nestimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method\neffectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both\nsimulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial\nresults for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to\nexplore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.",

        "summary": "Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion\nmodels, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales.\nThis \"one-size-fits-all\" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of\ndifferent prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or\nfixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to\ngeneralize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a\nframework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from\na suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space\nevaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a\nhuman preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the\nreverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search\nto select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance\nschedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3,\nshowing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text\nrendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default\nImagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate\nfor overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts\ntargeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that\nthe optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and\nprovides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.",

Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this\npaper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance\nMRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM\ndevelopment pipeline, including \\textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,\nNaive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \\textit{reward head\narchitecture}, \\textit{training strategies}, \\textit{data curation} (covering\nover ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \\textit{backbone model}\nand \\textit{model scale}, and \\textit{ensemble methods}.\n  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \\textbf{BaseReward}, a\npowerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling.

        "summary": "Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language\nmodels, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to\nintractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process\nto enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks,\nincluding solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated\nintegration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion\nNegative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that\noptimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching.\nDiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit\npolicy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals\ninto the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with\narbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and\nrequires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy\noptimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in\nhead-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT\nimproves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO\nachieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging\nmultiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of\nSD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.",

        "title": "Towards Robust Visual Continual Learning with Multi-Prototype Supervision",
        "summary": "Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a\nPretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual\nContinual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two\ncritical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name\nresults in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual\ndiversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual\nappearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework\nthat replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.\nSpecifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category\ndisambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic\nprototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to\nadaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive\nexperiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently\nenhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for\nlanguage-guided continual learning.",

        "summary": "Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and\nfood security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by\naffecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm\nmanagement systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in\novercoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data\nanalysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal\ndata for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral\ndata, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To\nresolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield\nPrediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with\nspatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and\ndependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained\nmodels trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive\nlearning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing\nspatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing\ndata. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of\nthe proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.\nMTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8,\nand an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield\nprediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The\noutstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and\nprovides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions,\npotentially improving crop yields.",

While recent neural surface reconstruction\nmethods have achieved remarkable results in static 3D reconstruction, extending\nthese approaches with comparable quality for dynamic scenes introduces\nsignificant computational and representational challenges. Existing dynamic\nmethods focus on novel-view synthesis, therefore, their extracted meshes tend\nto be noisy. Even approaches aiming for geometric fidelity often result in too\nsmooth meshes due to the ill-posedness of the problem.

        "summary": "Image denoising plays a critical role in biomedical and microscopy imaging,\nespecially when acquiring wide-field fluorescence-stained images. This task\nfaces challenges in multiple fronts, including limitations in image acquisition\nconditions, complex noise types, algorithm adaptability, and clinical\napplication demands. Although many deep learning-based denoising techniques\nhave demonstrated promising results, further improvements are needed in\npreserving image details, enhancing algorithmic efficiency, and increasing\nclinical interpretability. We propose an unsupervised image denoising method\nbased on a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. The approach\nintroduces a multi-scale adaptive generator based on the Wavelet Transform and\na dual-branch discriminator that integrates difference perception feature maps\nwith original features. Experimental results on multiple biomedical microscopy\nimage datasets show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art denoising\nperformance, particularly excelling in the preservation of high-frequency\ninformation. Furthermore, the dual-branch discriminator is seamlessly\ncompatible with various GAN frameworks. The proposed quality-aware,\nwavelet-driven GAN denoising model is termed as QWD-GAN.",

        "summary": "Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing\nmethods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to\nestimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and\nhence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron\nTomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost\nuncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode\nwhere the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model\nthat learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL\ncycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure\nuncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not\nrely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method\nsuitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data\nuncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to\nthe upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the\nproposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The\nresults demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.",

In\nthis paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called\nChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and\nKeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these\nissues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism\nthat systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage\nprocess to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal\ninformation. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective\ntemporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection\ndetection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.\nSecondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm\nwith a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models\nto leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our\nproposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench\ncompared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while\nenabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B\nparameter alternatives.",

        "summary": "The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in\nsupervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios.\nRecently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed\nto enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised\nlearning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the\nchallenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.\nAlthough some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,\nsuch domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,\nwe address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a\nMinimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves\nall semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)\nmaximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We\ntheoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information\ntheory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency\nand minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we\nimplement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a\nlearnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve\nsufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel\nsemantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism\nfor capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new\nstate-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks,\nconsistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or\ndomain labels during representation learning.",

Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform\nsmoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying\ndeformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation,\nwe propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements\nanatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation\npatterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into\nanatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains\nare then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized\npartial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global\ndeformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%\nDice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms\nexisting methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios\n(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our\nSegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on\nsegmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a\nsegmentation problem.

(iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:\nEach image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding\nchallenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on\nMCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.\nNotably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this\ndegradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing\ndetection robustness.

DSKI\ncomprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for\nextracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during\ntraining, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts\ndetection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods\nand human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical\nmodalities.",

The multimodal\nobservations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band\nvisible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites,\nand (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar\n(CALIOP\\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\\slash CloudSat).

We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with\nseveral baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all\ndesigned to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is\nevaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall,\nF1-score, and IoU.

Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple\nsub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing\nexponential computational overhead during inference.

However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous\ncontexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually\nexpected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification\nand hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the\nObject Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark\nthat evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate\nfrom expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling,\nwhich identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2)\nCLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are\nlikely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating\n18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal\nsignificant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual\nincongruity.

        "summary": "Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of\ntasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In\nhandwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the\nsample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the\ncalligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word\nspacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in\ninconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes\nmulti-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These\nmulti-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.\nSecondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word\nspacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional\ndiffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly\ngenerated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal\ncoordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our\nproposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by\ncalligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke\ngeneration in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed\ndiffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and\nis competitive with recent image generation networks.",

Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that\nsimply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic\ndiversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform\ntraining strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in\nsuboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above\nchallenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label\nConsistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence\nreliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.\nSpecifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish\nclean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency\nto uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label\nConsistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the\nseparation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly,\nwe adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are\noptimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text\nreplacement during training.

        "summary": "Micro-ultrasound (micro-US) is a promising imaging technique for cancer\ndetection and computer-assisted visualization. This study investigates prostate\ncapsule segmentation using deep learning techniques from micro-US images,\naddressing the challenges posed by the ambiguous boundaries of the prostate\ncapsule. Existing methods often struggle in such cases, motivating the\ndevelopment of a tailored approach. This study introduces an adaptive focal\nloss function that dynamically emphasizes both hard and easy regions, taking\ninto account their respective difficulty levels and annotation variability. The\nproposed methodology has two primary strategies: integrating a standard focal\nloss function as a baseline to design an adaptive focal loss function for\nproper prostate capsule segmentation. The focal loss baseline provides a robust\nfoundation, incorporating class balancing and focusing on examples that are\ndifficult to classify. The adaptive focal loss offers additional flexibility,\naddressing the fuzzy region of the prostate capsule and annotation variability\nby dilating the hard regions identified through discrepancies between expert\nand non-expert annotations. The proposed method dynamically adjusts the\nsegmentation model's weights better to identify the fuzzy regions of the\nprostate capsule. The proposed adaptive focal loss function demonstrates\nsuperior performance, achieving a mean dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.940 and a\nmean Hausdorff distance (HD) of 1.949 mm in the testing dataset. These results\nhighlight the effectiveness of integrating advanced loss functions and adaptive\ntechniques into deep learning models. This enhances the accuracy of prostate\ncapsule segmentation in micro-US images, offering the potential to improve\nclinical decision-making in prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning.",

        "summary": "Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three\ncore problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA)\nsolutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified\nprinciple address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and\nfoster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)\nas a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent\nspace that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,\ntext, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent\nzones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as\ncompositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional\nimage generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses\nan image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We\ndemonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN\ncan enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA\nRectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without\nmodifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently\n(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation\nlearning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and\nSimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear\nclassification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously\n(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,\nLZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA\nclassification accuracy on CIFAR10.

We introduce\n\\textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate\nfeatures from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and\nfuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most\ndiscriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the\nmiddle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for\nlanguage tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located\nin the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across\nvarying datasets: a mysterious \"Layer $12$\" consistently yields the best\nperformance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under\nDiT-XL/2-256$\\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that\npinpoints the locally optimal \"image-text\"$\\times$\"block-timestep\" pair among a\nfew candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search.

In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework\ndesigned with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using\n3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our\napproach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth\nestimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions\nwith a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable\nalignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we\npropose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a\nfine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce\noverfitting.

        "summary": "Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to\nboth emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and\nemotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire\nunderstanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis\npredominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary\nnon-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional\nMultimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,\nwhich enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively\ncapture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,\nlow-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for\ncross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into\nsub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to\ncapture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an\nimage-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal\ninteraction at both local and global representations of image information.\nAdditionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale\nimage strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into\nsub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a\nmultimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as\nemotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent\nimprovements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness\nof our proposed method.

These\nmodels include afferent connections (retina and LGN to the visual cortex) and\nlong-range projections (connections across different visual cortical areas).\nHowever, in the mammalian visual system, there are connections within each\nvisual cortical area, known as lateral (or horizontal) connections. These would\nroughly correspond to connections within CNN feature maps, and this important\narchitectural feature is missing in current CNN models. In this paper, we\npresent how such lateral connections can be modeled within the standard CNN\nframework, and test its benefits and analyze its emergent properties in\nrelation to the biological visual system. We will focus on two main\narchitectural features of lateral connections: (1) recurrent activation and (2)\nseparation of excitatory and inhibitory connections. We show that recurrent CNN\nusing weight sharing is equivalent to lateral connections, and propose a custom\nloss function to separate excitatory and inhibitory weights. The addition of\nthese two leads to increased classification accuracy, and importantly, the\nactivation properties and connection properties of the resulting model show\nproperties similar to those observed in the biological visual system. We expect\nour approach to help align CNN closer to its biological counterpart and better\nunderstand the principles of visual cortical computation.",

        "summary": "Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) is a popular framework for solving imaging inverse\nproblems by integrating learned priors in the form of denoisers trained to\nremove Gaussian noise from images. In standard PnP methods, the denoiser is\napplied directly in the image domain, serving as an implicit prior on natural\nimages. This paper considers an alternative analysis formulation of PnP, in\nwhich the prior is imposed on a transformed representation of the image, such\nas its gradient. Specifically, we train a Gaussian denoiser to operate in the\ngradient domain, rather than on the image itself. Conceptually, this is an\nextension of total variation (TV) regularization to learned TV regularization.\nTo incorporate this gradient-domain prior in image reconstruction algorithms,\nwe develop two analysis PnP algorithms based on half-quadratic splitting\n(APnP-HQS) and the alternating direction method of multipliers (APnP-ADMM). We\nevaluate our approach on image deblurring and super-resolution, demonstrating\nthat the analysis formulation achieves performance comparable to image-domain\nPnP algorithms.",

        "summary": "Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to\nheterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation\nmodels (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in\npredicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment\nresponse and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a\nneuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,\nenabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining\ncross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones\n(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class\nimbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers\n(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),\ncontinuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1\nwild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular\nprediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean\nbalanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with\nthe largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to\n0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).\nFor survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647\nto 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral\nregions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields\nmore site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon\nmarkers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for\nprospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional\nsignals to advance precision neuro-oncology.",

In contrast, prevailing\nmachine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in\nexcessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and\nmodel size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and\nreal-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework\naiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision\nmodels. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential\ndecision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions\npertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations,\nand actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory\nintegrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning,\nenabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without\nadditional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17\nbenchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition,\nfine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving\nand medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side\ncomparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction\nwithout sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and\nresource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via\nits fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient,\nflexible, and interpretable computer vision.

In our framework, the forward process performs\n\\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally\ncoupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase,\ngradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The\nreverse process then performs \\textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse\npatterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach\nenables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical\ngeneration process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale\ndetails. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware\nnetworks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive\nresults on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation\nquality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.\nUltimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired\nsynchronization dynamics as structured priors in generative modeling.",

        "summary": "Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members\nand categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing\ndeep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g.,\ntransformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic\ndependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on\nimplicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual\nreasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel\nframework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large\nLanguage Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by\nintroducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP>\ntokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and\nlanguage instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained\ncommonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP>\ntokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities\nand learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively.\nAlso, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the\n<ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then,\nwe design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates\nMLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual\nfeatures, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and\nqualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed\nmethod in GAD taks.",

        "summary": "Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of\nrecognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR\nover recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world\nvisual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and\npose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local\nIntegrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon\ntwo key insights: (i) learning an initial \\textit{coarse} alignment between\nvisual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content\nfacilitates the subsequent learning of \\textit{precise} visual-to-speech\nmappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain\nlocal regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues\nfor lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path\nfeature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features\nwithin a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the\nmodel learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding\nacoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a\ncoarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a\nContextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features\nwith relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,\nrefining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our\nframework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive\nlearning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual\nchallenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3\nbenchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced\nchallenging Mandarin dataset.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder\nframework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as\nsufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D\nrepresentation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both\nimage-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation.\nSegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In\nthe encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image\nfeatures from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for\n3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D\nanchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries\nobtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries\nserve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively\navoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory\nwhile faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The\nintroducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate\ncross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D\nachieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D\ninstance segmentation benchmarks.

        "summary": "Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a\nfundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are\ninherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing\ndata-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth\nnormals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency\nmakes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the\navailability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the\ncase. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface\nrepresentations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening\nproperties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using\nB-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline\ncontrol points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of\na fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very\ndifficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we\ndevelop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface\nreconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and\nthe number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth\nsurfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction\nmethod with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing\nwidely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all\nof them both qualitatively and quantitatively.",

        "summary": "Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure\nacross multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption\nof view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across\ndifferent views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often\npresent a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across\ndifferent views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work,\nwe consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order\nshift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view\nclustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view\nclustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to\nunderstand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the\npartially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with\npartially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining\ninvariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational\nAuto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing\ninformation to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed\nto perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive\nregularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this\npaper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal\nlearning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data\nillustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.",

        "summary": "Autonomous Driving (AD) systems have made notable progress, but their\nperformance in long-tail, safety-critical scenarios remains limited. These rare\ncases contribute a disproportionate number of accidents. Vision-Language Action\n(VLA) models have strong reasoning abilities and offer a potential solution,\nbut their effectiveness is limited by the lack of high-quality data and\ninefficient learning in such conditions. To address these challenges, we\npropose CoReVLA, a continual learning end-to-end autonomous driving framework\nthat improves the performance in long-tail scenarios through a dual-stage\nprocess of data Collection and behavior Refinement. First, the model is jointly\nfine-tuned on a mixture of open-source driving QA datasets, allowing it to\nacquire a foundational understanding of driving scenarios. Next, CoReVLA is\ndeployed within the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) simulation\nplatform, where driver takeover data is collected from real-time interactions.\nEach takeover indicates a long-tail scenario that CoReVLA fails to handle\nreliably. Finally, the model is refined via Direct Preference Optimization\n(DPO), allowing it to learn directly from human preferences and thereby avoid\nreward hacking caused by manually designed rewards. Extensive open-loop and\nclosed-loop experiments demonstrate that the proposed CoReVLA model can\naccurately perceive driving scenarios and make appropriate decisions. On the\nBench2Drive benchmark, CoReVLA achieves a Driving Score (DS) of 72.18 and a\nSuccess Rate (SR) of 50%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 7.96 DS and\n15% SR under long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. Furthermore, case studies\ndemonstrate the model's ability to continually improve its performance in\nsimilar failure-prone scenarios by leveraging past takeover experiences.

While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research\ndue to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture\nfine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular\nmemory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view\nmethods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic\nsegmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the\nrapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot\nrecognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current\nstate-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for\nLiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our\nknowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation,\ncoupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard\nprojection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for\nrange-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to\nthe encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies\ninherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to\nthe geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism\nin the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial\npatterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images.

One way of\nhandling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive\nfield families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of\nfreedom in the image transformations.\n  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial\nand spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of\nthe shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive\nfields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,\nroughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie\ngroups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which\ndescribe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales\ncan be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output\nfrom corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,\nstructurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional\npreferences.\n  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships\nbetween spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different\nvalues of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more\nefficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of\nmulti-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating\nidealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological\nvision.",

        "summary": "Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between\nvisually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that\nremains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class\ndifferences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization\nnetworks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep\nunderstanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream\ntasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial\nredundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required\nparts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that\nfirst extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,\nfrom which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a\nweight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh\nthe impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus\nrepresentations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based\nmethods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to\neliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks\n(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect\ndatasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method\nachieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while\nconsistently outperforming our baseline encoder.",

        "summary": "The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by\ndelivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training\nlarge-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial\nmemory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,\nwhich can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we\npropose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian\nSplatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a\nsubset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this\ndramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and\noptimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's\nlimited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three\nsystem-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters\nfor fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer\nupdates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize\nunnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive\nevaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly\nlowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds\ncomparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian\nSplatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the\nnumber of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,\nleading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)\nimprovement.",

        "summary": "This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient\nObject Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols,\nparticularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly\ndifferent sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel\nperspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD\nmetrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation\noutcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed\ninto a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being\ndirectly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the\nprediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet\npotentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading\nto biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this\nchallenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.\nThe core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then\naggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size\nimbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated\noptimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle\nand significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad\nrange of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly\nintegrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present\ngeneralization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the\nvalidity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments\nspeak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at\nhttps://github.com/Ferry-Li/SI-SOD.",

However, existing pruning-based approaches\noften fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters\nresponsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of\nfine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior\nperformance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater\ninterpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we\npropose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \\emph{selection} mechanism\nto identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an\n\\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two\ncomplementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through\nthe inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that\njointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and\nsample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner\nproblem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer\nproblem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing\nclean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains\nstrong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive\nresults compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches.

To address these limitations, we propose a\nnovel framework named FMD-TransUNet for precise abdominal multi-organ\nsegmentation. It innovatively integrates the Multi-axis External Weight Block\n(MEWB) and the improved dual attention module (DA+) into the TransUNet\nframework. The MEWB extracts multi-axis frequency-domain features to capture\nboth global anatomical structures and local boundary details, providing\ncomplementary information to spatial-domain representations. The DA+ block\nutilizes depthwise separable convolutions and incorporates spatial and channel\nattention mechanisms to enhance feature fusion, reduce redundant information,\nand narrow the semantic gap between the encoder and decoder. Experimental\nvalidation on the Synapse dataset shows that FMD-TransUNet outperforms other\nrecent state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average DSC of 81.32\\% and a HD\nof 16.35 mm across eight abdominal organs. Compared to the baseline model, the\naverage DSC increased by 3.84\\%, and the average HD decreased by 15.34 mm.\nThese results demonstrate the effectiveness of FMD-TransUNet in improving the\naccuracy of abdominal multi-organ segmentation.",

Therefore, this work\npresents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and\nradars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV).

We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the\nFPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures\nwith the main goal of reducing inference time.

Open in-situ datasets\nfrom principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual\nannotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage\noften leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep\nlearning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address\nthis issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically\ncoherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a\nminimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain\nunderexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially\nin the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address\nthis gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for\nsystematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale\nland cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both\ninput-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation\nby postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models.\nAdditionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to\nimprove performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual\nSentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff\nbetween accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our\nresults show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of\ncommon pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.\nInput-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas\noutput-level aggregation performs best with more data.

        "summary": "Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications\nsuch as video editing and autonomous driving. While Cutie provides strong\nquery-based segmentation and SAM2 offers enriched representations via a\npretrained ViT encoder, each has limitations in feature capacity and temporal\nmodeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their\ncomplementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder\nof SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We\nfurther adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant,\nachieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to\nour final model as SCOPE (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). This\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion\nprediction for robust video object segmentation.

Traditional methods like geometric\nalgorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise,\nlimited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a\nframework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything\nModel (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using\ngrid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we\ncreate robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for\nprecise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts.\nRoom masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering,\nfollowed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and\nregularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room\ntopological relationships.

Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some\nlimitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we\nadditionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity.

        "summary": "Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change\ndetection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD\ndatasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and\na lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully\nsupport practical applications. At the methodological level, most current\napproaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a\npost-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further\nimprovements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new\nbenchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the\ndataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more\nfine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved\nroads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)\nmethod, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and\nbackgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model\ncollaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its\nability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal\ninteraction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction\nFusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the\nmodel's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,\nJL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive\nresults compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,\nand 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively.

We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to\nadoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.\nSpecifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through\nearly prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to\nbuild shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when\ntransitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets\nand AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In\naddition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to\ncapture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.\n  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and\nworkflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By\ndocumenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address\nthe gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world\nAI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.",

        "summary": "Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology\n(CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent\nstudies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the\nstructure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we\nsystematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation\nmodels using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models\nanalyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and\nself-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through\nrepresentational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find\nthat UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,\nwhereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having\nthe same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee\nhigher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a\nhigh slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain\nnormalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%\n(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language\nmodels demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more\ndistributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight\nopportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model\nensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape\nmodel representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging\ndomains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can\nhelp ensure effective development and deployment.",
