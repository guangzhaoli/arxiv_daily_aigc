        "summary": "Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving\nunprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer\narchitectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when\nextending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive\nformulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from\nshort-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models\ncannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their\ntraining horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from\nthe compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we\npropose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in\nlong-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video\nteachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on\nexploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the\nstudent model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos.\nOur method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to\n20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure\nand error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous\nmethods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of\ngenerating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the\nmaximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x\nlonger than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and\nour proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially\noutperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency.

        "summary": "Video stylization plays a key role in content creation, but it remains a\nchallenging problem. Na\\\"ively applying image stylization frame-by-frame hurts\ntemporal consistency and reduces style richness. Alternatively, training a\ndedicated video stylization model typically requires paired video data and is\ncomputationally expensive. In this paper, we propose FreeViS, a training-free\nvideo stylization framework that generates stylized videos with rich style\ndetails and strong temporal coherence. Our method integrates multiple stylized\nreferences to a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) model, effectively mitigating\nthe propagation errors observed in prior works, without introducing flickers\nand stutters. In addition, it leverages high-frequency compensation to\nconstrain the content layout and motion, together with flow-based motion cues\nto preserve style textures in low-saliency regions. Through extensive\nevaluations, FreeViS delivers higher stylization fidelity and superior temporal\nconsistency, outperforming recent baselines and achieving strong human\npreference. Our training-free pipeline offers a practical and economic solution\nfor high-quality, temporally coherent video stylization.

        "summary": "Text-to-image (T2I) models excel on single-entity prompts but struggle with\nmulti-subject descriptions, often showing attribute leakage, identity\nentanglement, and subject omissions. We introduce the first theoretical\nframework with a principled, optimizable objective for steering sampling\ndynamics toward multi-subject fidelity. Viewing flow matching (FM) through\nstochastic optimal control (SOC), we formulate subject disentanglement as\ncontrol over a trained FM sampler. This yields two architecture-agnostic\nalgorithms: (i) a training-free test-time controller that perturbs the base\nvelocity with a single-pass update, and (ii) Adjoint Matching, a lightweight\nfine-tuning rule that regresses a control network to a backward adjoint signal\nwhile preserving base-model capabilities. The same formulation unifies prior\nattention heuristics, extends to diffusion models via a flow-diffusion\ncorrespondence, and provides the first fine-tuning route explicitly designed\nfor multi-subject fidelity. Empirically, on Stable Diffusion 3.5, FLUX, and\nStable Diffusion XL, both algorithms consistently improve multi-subject\nalignment while maintaining base-model style. Test-time control runs\nefficiently on commodity GPUs, and fine-tuned controllers trained on limited\nprompts generalize to unseen ones.

TempoControl utilizes cross-attention\nmaps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of\nconcepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention\nusing three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a\ncontrol signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via\nenergy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy).

However, existing approaches for vision tasks often rely on indirect\nrepresentations, such as generating coordinates as text for detection, which\nlimits performance and prevents dense prediction tasks like segmentation. To\novercome these challenges, we introduce Patch-as-Decodable Token (PaDT), a\nunified paradigm that enables MLLMs to directly generate both textual and\ndiverse visual outputs. Central to PaDT are Visual Reference Tokens (VRTs),\nderived from visual patch embeddings of query images and interleaved seamlessly\nwith LLM's output textual tokens. A lightweight decoder then transforms LLM's\noutputs into detection, segmentation, and grounding predictions. Unlike prior\nmethods, PaDT processes VRTs independently at each forward pass and dynamically\nexpands the embedding table, thus improving localization and differentiation\namong similar objects. We further tailor a training strategy for PaDT by\nrandomly selecting VRTs for supervised fine-tuning and introducing a robust\nper-token cross-entropy loss. Our empirical studies across four visual\nperception and understanding tasks suggest PaDT consistently achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance, even compared with significantly larger MLLM\nmodels.

However, constructing\nsuch models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous\nembeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality\nimages but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive\napproaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but\noften face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In\nthis work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments\npre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a\nMixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and\ngeneration within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve\nvisual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete\nrepresentation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel\ntokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual\ndetails with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments\nacross diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves\ncompetitive or superior results in both understanding and generation\nbenchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time\ncompared to prior unified MLLMs.",

        "summary": "Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training\ndatasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative\nexamples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models\nand large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large\nVision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can\noutperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose\nthe first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We\nprove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during\ninstruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model\nparameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model\nduring training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters\nexamples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their\nattention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a\nbalanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in\nlarge-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can\ndiscard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while\nfully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and\nspeeding up its training by 1.2x.

        "summary": "While there has been significant progress in the field of 3D avatar creation\nfrom visual observations, modeling physically plausible dynamics of humans with\nloose garments remains a challenging problem. Although a few existing works\naddress this problem by leveraging physical simulation, they suffer from\nlimited accuracy or robustness to novel animation inputs. In this work, we\npresent MPMAvatar, a framework for creating 3D human avatars from multi-view\nvideos that supports highly realistic, robust animation, as well as\nphotorealistic rendering from free viewpoints. For accurate and robust dynamics\nmodeling, our key idea is to use a Material Point Method-based simulator, which\nwe carefully tailor to model garments with complex deformations and contact\nwith the underlying body by incorporating an anisotropic constitutive model and\na novel collision handling algorithm. We combine this dynamics modeling scheme\nwith our canonical avatar that can be rendered using 3D Gaussian Splatting with\nquasi-shadowing, enabling high-fidelity rendering for physically realistic\nanimations. In our experiments, we demonstrate that MPMAvatar significantly\noutperforms the existing state-of-the-art physics-based avatar in terms of (1)\ndynamics modeling accuracy, (2) rendering accuracy, and (3) robustness and\nefficiency. Additionally, we present a novel application in which our avatar\ngeneralizes to unseen interactions in a zero-shot manner-which was not\nachievable with previous learning-based methods due to their limited simulation\ngeneralizability.

High-resolution text-to-image generators are\ncurrently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative\nto their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key\ntechnical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this\nlimitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across\nresolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal\nfrom lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a\ntrain-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that\nrecalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size.\nNoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and\nis compatible with existing models.

While diffusion models have achieved\nremarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous\nGaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework\nfor jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond\nunification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and\nprincipled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited\nfor posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion\nposterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields\nsparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs\nsamplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked\ndiffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized\nexpectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and\nanchored remasking for adaptive decoding.

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video\ngeneration that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and\neffects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method\ngenerates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We\npropose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion\nsupervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion\nmodels (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate\nsignificant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,\nKineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual\nconditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support\nfor synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that\nKineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.\nAblation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and\nhigh-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made\npublicly available.",

        "summary": "Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a\nvariety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the\n\"needle in a haystack\" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced\nfrom raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions\nalleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing\ntoken count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal\ndynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In\nthis work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and\ndemonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips,\nwhich are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To\nmaintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token\nfootprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically\nbalances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count\nper video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our\ntraining-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and\n10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively.

        "summary": "Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target\nregion, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion,\nare insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image\nmanifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow\nmatching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly\nstronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based\nediting has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the\nfirst framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based\nediting, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first\nshow that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:\nunlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently\nstructured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To\novercome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,\nwhere affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature\nsupervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization\nadapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving\nbackground fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.\nFor evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)\nfeaturing region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on\nDragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and\nregion-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image\nediting.

The recently introduced ReasonMap highlights this gap\nby showing that even advanced MLLMs struggle with spatial reasoning in\nstructured and information-rich settings such as transit maps, a task of clear\npractical and scientific importance. However, standard reinforcement learning\n(RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To\naddress this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that\nintroduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks,\nenabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding\nskills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to\nimprove both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.\nRewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware\nreward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse\nrewards while providing richer supervision.

        "summary": "Understanding how neural populations in higher visual areas encode\nobject-centered visual information remains a central challenge in computational\nneuroscience. Prior works have investigated representational alignment between\nartificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings\nare indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations\nthemselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features\nfrom neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations.\nThis leaves open a scientific question: \"how feature-specific visual\ninformation is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas,\nand whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful\nsubspaces.\" To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages\nthe generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the\nvisual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first\nuses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent\nsubspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information\n(MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific\nvisual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on\nmulti-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of\ntwo macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies\nneural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual\nfeatures, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and\nintra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of\nstructured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our\nunderstanding of its encoding principles.",

Existing neural rendering approaches\noften rely on simplified BRDF models or parameterizations that couple diffuse\nand specular components, which restricts faithful material recovery and limits\nrelighting fidelity. We propose a relightable framework that integrates a\nmicrofacet BRDF with the specular-glossiness parameterization into 2D Gaussian\nSplatting with deferred shading. This formulation enables more physically\nconsistent material decomposition, while diffusion-based priors for surface\nnormals and diffuse color guide early-stage optimization and mitigate\nambiguity. A coarse-to-fine optimization of the environment map accelerates\nconvergence and preserves high-dynamic-range specular reflections.

Previous approaches usually rely\non point clouds or require pre-defined homeomorphic mappings for untextured\ndata. Our method overcomes these limitations by leveraging mesh-guided 3D\nGaussian Splatting (3DGS) for high-fidelity geometry and appearance modeling.\nThe core of our framework is a unified deformation strategy that anchors\n3DGaussians to reconstructed mesh patches, ensuring geometrically consistent\ntransformations while preserving texture fidelity through topology-aware\nconstraints. In parallel, our framework establishes unsupervised semantic\ncorrespondence by using the mesh topology as a geometric prior and maintains\nstructural integrity via physically plausible point trajectories. This\nintegrated approach preserves both local detail and global semantic coherence\nthroughout the morphing process with out requiring labeled data. On our\nproposed TexMorph benchmark, GaussianMorphing substantially outperforms prior\n2D/3D methods, reducing color consistency error ($\\Delta E$) by 22.2% and EI by\n26.2%.

To address these issues, we propose\n4DGS-Craft, a consistent and interactive 4DGS editing framework. We first\nintroduce a 4D-aware InstructPix2Pix model to ensure both view and temporal\nconsistency. This model incorporates 4D VGGT geometry features extracted from\nthe initial scene, enabling it to capture underlying 4D geometric structures\nduring editing. We further enhance this model with a multi-view grid module\nthat enforces consistency by iteratively refining multi-view input images while\njointly optimizing the underlying 4D scene. Furthermore, we preserve the\nconsistency of non-edited regions through a novel Gaussian selection mechanism,\nwhich identifies and optimizes only the Gaussians within the edited regions.\nBeyond consistency, facilitating user interaction is also crucial for effective\n4DGS editing. Therefore, we design an LLM-based module for user intent\nunderstanding. This module employs a user instruction template to define atomic\nediting operations and leverages an LLM for reasoning. As a result, our\nframework can interpret user intent and decompose complex instructions into a\nlogical sequence of atomic operations, enabling it to handle intricate user\ncommands and further enhance editing performance.

        "summary": "The 'trust deficit' in online fruit and vegetable e-commerce stems from the\ninability of digital transactions to provide direct sensory perception of\nproduct quality. This paper constructs a 'Trust Pyramid' model through\n'dual-source verification' of consumer trust. Experiments confirm that quality\nis the cornerstone of trust. The study reveals an 'impossible triangle' in\nagricultural product grading, comprising biological characteristics,\ntimeliness, and economic viability, highlighting the limitations of traditional\nabsolute grading standards. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we propose\nthe 'Triangular Trust Index' (TTI). We redefine the role of algorithms from\n'decision-makers' to 'providers of transparent decision-making bases',\ndesigning the explainable AI framework--TriAlignXA. This framework supports\ntrustworthy online transactions within agricultural constraints through\nmulti-objective optimization. Its core relies on three engines: the\nBio-Adaptive Engine for granular quality description; the Timeliness\nOptimization Engine for processing efficiency; and the Economic Optimization\nEngine for cost control. Additionally, the \"Pre-Mapping Mechanism\" encodes\nprocess data into QR codes, transparently conveying quality information.\nExperiments on grading tasks demonstrate significantly higher accuracy than\nbaseline models. Empirical evidence and theoretical analysis verify the\nframework's balancing capability in addressing the \"impossible triangle\". This\nresearch provides comprehensive support--from theory to practice--for building\na trustworthy online produce ecosystem, establishing a critical pathway from\nalgorithmic decision-making to consumer trust.",

Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential\nEquations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse\ndenoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively\nexplore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference\nalignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves\nprecise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in\nreinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic\nSampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration\nwhile enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise,\nthereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently,\nto eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a\nMulti-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages\ncomputed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and\nrobust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various\nreward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations,\ndemonstrate that our $\\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing\nflow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.",

MedQ-Bench defines two complementary\ntasks: (1) MedQ-Perception, which probes low-level perceptual capability via\nhuman-curated questions on fundamental visual attributes; and (2)\nMedQ-Reasoning, encompassing both no-reference and comparison reasoning tasks,\naligning model evaluation with human-like reasoning on image quality. The\nbenchmark spans five imaging modalities and over forty quality attributes,\ntotaling 2,600 perceptual queries and 708 reasoning assessments, covering\ndiverse image sources including authentic clinical acquisitions, images with\nsimulated degradations via physics-based reconstructions, and AI-generated\nimages. To evaluate reasoning ability, we propose a multi-dimensional judging\nprotocol that assesses model outputs along four complementary axes. We further\nconduct rigorous human-AI alignment validation by comparing LLM-based judgement\nwith radiologists. Our evaluation of 14 state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrates\nthat models exhibit preliminary but unstable perceptual and reasoning skills,\nwith insufficient accuracy for reliable clinical use. These findings highlight\nthe need for targeted optimization of MLLMs in medical IQA. We hope that\nMedQ-Bench will catalyze further exploration and unlock the untapped potential\nof MLLMs for medical image quality evaluation.",

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at many multimodal tasks, yet they\nfrequently struggle with tasks requiring precise understanding and handling of\nfine-grained visual elements. This is mainly due to information loss during\nimage encoding or insufficient attention to critical regions. Recent work has\nshown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the\nreasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details\nduring their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often\noverused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual\ndetails. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for\nadaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level\noperations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply\noperation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in\ntextual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided\nreinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own\nresponses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be\ninvoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal\nreasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while\nsignificantly reducing unnecessary visual operations.

        "summary": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) leverages information fusion from diverse\nmodalities (e.g., text, audio, visual) to enhance sentiment prediction.\nHowever, simple fusion techniques often fail to account for variations in\nmodality quality, such as those that are noisy, missing, or semantically\nconflicting.

To mitigate this limitation, we introduce\na simple yet efficient \\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{G}ated \\textbf{F}usion\n\\textbf{N}etwork that adaptively adjusts feature weights via a dual gate fusion\nmechanism based on information entropy and modality importance.

        "summary": "This paper tackles the challenge of robust reconstruction, i.e., the task of\nreconstructing a 3D scene from a set of inconsistent multi-view images. Some\nrecent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and\nperform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D\nscene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations\nfor robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to\ndecouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and\nreconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this\nend, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based\non a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent\nimages into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion\nmodel to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D\nscenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view\ndegradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from\nlarge-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image\ninconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of\nour method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style\nof the reconstructed 3D scene. Project page:\nhttps://jin-cao-tma.github.io/UniVerse.github.io/",

Our approach performs point-wise\nreconstruction using 2D selected image warps optimized through a graph-based\nframework.

Additionally, our framework decouples\nconstraints on depth and conformal scale, which are inseparable in other\napproaches, enabling more precise depth estimation. To address the sensitivity\nof the formulated problem, we employ a parallel separable iterative\noptimization strategy. Furthermore, a self-supervised learning framework,\nutilizing an encoder-decoder network, is incorporated to generate dense 3D\npoint clouds with texture.

In this work, we\nintroduce Discrete Facial Encoding (DFE), an unsupervised, data-driven\nalternative of compact and interpretable dictionary of facial expressions from\n3D mesh sequences learned through a Residual Vector Quantized Variational\nAutoencoder (RVQ-VAE). Our approach first extracts identity-invariant\nexpression features from images using a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM), effectively\ndisentangling factors such as head pose and facial geometry. We then encode\nthese features using an RVQ-VAE, producing a sequence of discrete tokens from a\nshared codebook, where each token captures a specific, reusable facial\ndeformation pattern that contributes to the overall expression. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that Discrete Facial Encoding captures\nmore precise facial behaviors than FACS and other facial encoding alternatives.\nWe evaluate the utility of our representation across three high-level\npsychological tasks: stress detection, personality prediction, and depression\ndetection. Using a simple Bag-of-Words model built on top of the learned\ntokens, our system consistently outperforms both FACS-based pipelines and\nstrong image and video representation learning models such as Masked\nAutoencoders.

This layer produces visual prompts that act as an added textural bias\nto the input image, adapting its ``style'' to a target domain. To optimize\nthese visual reprogramming layers, we use multiple objective functions that\noptimize the intra- and inter-domain distribution differences when\ndomain-adapting visual prompts are applied. This process does not require\nmodifying the backbone parameters, allowing the same backbone to be reused\nacross different domains.\n  We evaluate VirDA on Office-31 and obtain 92.8% mean accuracy with only 1.5M\ntrainable parameters. VirDA surpasses PDA, the state-of-the-art\nparameter-efficient UDA baseline, by +1.6% accuracy while using just 46% of its\nparameters.

        "summary": "Imaging inverse problems aims to recover high-dimensional signals from\nundersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite\nsolutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity,\nprior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or\nlearned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors\ntypically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work,\nwe propose \\textit{Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space} (NPN), a novel\nclass of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in\nthe image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection\nof the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two\nkey advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the\nnull-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information\northogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing\nprocess. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems,\ncompatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to\nconventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on\nconvergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods.\nEmpirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors\nconsistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse\nproblems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed\ntomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods,\nunrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.",

In this work, we propose Diffusion-LPO, a simple and effective\nframework for Listwise Preference Optimization in diffusion models with\nlistwise data. Given a caption, we aggregate user feedback into a ranked list\nof images and derive a listwise extension of the DPO objective under the\nPlackett-Luce model.

        "summary": "Humans intuitively perceive complex social signals in visual scenes, yet it\nremains unclear whether state-of-the-art AI models encode the same similarity\nstructure. We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture\nhuman-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this\nstructure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we\nintroduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on\n250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality\ngap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align\nbetter with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap\nby fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our\nnovel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning\npairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields\nsignificantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in\nterms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance\npartitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance\nwith language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured\nby the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find\nthat human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective\nattributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the\npretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video\nmodels' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning\nshapes video representations toward human social perception.",

        "summary": "While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic\naneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks,\nincluding nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce\ncontrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating\nsynthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a\nmulti-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs\nsegmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared\nsemantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep\nlearning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while\nsimultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach\nintegrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,\nenabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical\nsegmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires\nno initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder\nand decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training\nstrategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common\nconstraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of\n264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task\nand multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61\ndB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,\nit improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus\nDice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to\nmore accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm\nfrom 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to\nnnU-Net.

        "title": "VENTURA: Adapting Image Diffusion Models for Unified Task Conditioned Navigation",
        "summary": "Robots must adapt to diverse human instructions and operate safely in\nunstructured, open-world environments. Recent Vision-Language models (VLMs)\noffer strong priors for grounding language and perception, but remain difficult\nto steer for navigation due to differences in action spaces and pretraining\nobjectives that hamper transferability to robotics tasks. Towards addressing\nthis, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes\ninternet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of\ndirectly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a\nvisual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware\nnavigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these\nvisual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows\nnatural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors. To scale\ntraining, we supervise on path masks derived from self-supervised tracking\nmodels paired with VLM-augmented captions, avoiding manual pixel-level\nannotation or highly engineered data collection setups. In extensive real-world\nevaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on\nobject reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving\nsuccess rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen\nscenarios. Notably, we find that VENTURA generalizes to unseen combinations of\ndistinct tasks, revealing emergent compositional capabilities.

        "summary": "Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video\nenhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual\nimpact of interpolation artefacts effectively.

Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which\nis then used to weight image errors.

Performance remains\nconsistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator\nused. The efficiency and accuracy of $\\text{PSNR}_{\\text{DIV}}$ enables fast\nquality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural\nnetworks for video frame interpolation tasks.

        "summary": "Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative\ndiffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular,\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled\ntext-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy\nand perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending\nthese advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant\nchallenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing\nsubtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply\nimage-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally\ninconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent\nadvances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent\ndiffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal\ncausality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot\nor plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with\npriors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for\nautomatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction\nquality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong\nmeasurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.\nExtensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show\nsignificant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that\napply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both\nreconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.",

In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem\nand design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes\na pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements\nalone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived\nfrom the measured locations.

        "summary": "Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to\n3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D\nfeatures into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing\ngeometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale\nannotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant\nsegmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with\n3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the\n2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated\nfeatures. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small\nStudent Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using\ngeometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During\ninference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the\npoint cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from\nlatent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify\neffectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency.\nExtensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify\nachieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about\n1.5% of the training data.

Large-scale pre-training of foundation visual\nencoders has advanced many fields, as the enormous quantity of data helps to\nlearn the general distribution of normal images. We observe that the anomaly\namount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt\nembeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed\nFoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the\nnatural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for\nanomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in\nan image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class\ndetection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer\nparameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple\nfoundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the\nperspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly\ndetection.",

        "summary": "Bronze inscriptions (BI), engraved on ritual vessels, constitute a crucial\nstage of early Chinese writing and provide indispensable evidence for\narchaeological and historical studies. However, automatic BI recognition\nremains difficult due to severe visual degradation, multi-domain variability\nacross photographs, rubbings, and tracings, and an extremely long-tailed\ncharacter distribution. To address these challenges, we curate a large-scale BI\ndataset comprising 22454 full-page images and 198598 annotated characters\nspanning 6658 unique categories, enabling robust cross-domain evaluation.\nBuilding on this resource, we develop a two-stage detection-recognition\npipeline that first localizes inscriptions and then transcribes individual\ncharacters. To handle heterogeneous domains and rare classes, we equip the\npipeline with LadderMoE, which augments a pretrained CLIP encoder with\nladder-style MoE adapters, enabling dynamic expert specialization and stronger\nrobustness. Comprehensive experiments on single-character and full-page\nrecognition tasks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms\nstate-of-the-art scene text recognition baselines, achieving superior accuracy\nacross head, mid, and tail categories as well as all acquisition modalities.\nThese results establish a strong foundation for bronze inscription recognition\nand downstream archaeological analysis.",

        "summary": "Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for\nfine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local\ncues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse\nglobal features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks.\nPrior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model\n(LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach\noverlooks spatial precision. We propose $\\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training\nframework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using\nfine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP)\nwithin a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided\n$\\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global\n$\\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we\nintroduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via\nmulti-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling,\nand a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned\nwith TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which\nconvexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to\niteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent\nfine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\\%$ average accuracy\ngain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/sathiiii/microCLIP.",

        "summary": "Advances in machine learning and wearable sensors offer new opportunities for\ncapturing and analyzing human movement outside specialized laboratories.\nAccurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential\nfor telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation. This preclinical\nbenchmark compares monocular video-based 3D human pose estimation models with\ninertial measurement units (IMUs), leveraging the VIDIMU dataset containing a\ntotal of 13 clinically relevant daily activities which were captured using both\ncommodity video cameras and five IMUs. During this initial study only healthy\nsubjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological\ncohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks\n(MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA\nBodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using\nOpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17\nkeypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance,\nachieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\\deg \\pm 4.80\\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\\deg\n\\pm 4.18\\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \\pm 0.15$)\nand the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \\pm 0.28$). The\nresults reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic\nassessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and\nsensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This\nstudy clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically\npromising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based\nestimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians\nseeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for\ntelehealth and remote patient monitoring.",

To address this gap, we propose a noninvasive biometric\nidentification approach that leverages uniqueness of the auricular vein\npatterns. To this end, we have collected 800 ear images from 20 mixed-breed\npigs (Landrace cross Pietrain and Duroc cross Pietrain), captured using a\nstandard smartphone and simple back lighting. A multistage computer vision\npipeline was developed to enhance vein visibility, extract structural and\nspatial features, and generate biometric signatures. These features were then\nclassified using machine learning models. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\nachieved the highest accuracy: correctly identifying pigs with 98.12% precision\nacross mixed-breed populations. The entire process from image processing to\nclassification was completed in an average of 8.3 seconds, demonstrating\nfeasibility for real-time farm deployment. We believe that by replacing fragile\nphysical identifiers with permanent biological markers, this system provides\nfarmers with a cost-effective and stress-free method of animal identification.\nMore broadly, the findings confirm the practicality of auricular vein\nbiometrics for digitizing livestock management, reinforcing its potential to\nextend the benefits of precision farming to resource-constrained agricultural\ncommunities.",

To\nsolve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset\nfor training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated\n(v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation.\nThe proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in\naccuracy of 95.50\\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to\nthreshold-based approaches.

        "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has established itself as an efficient\nrepresentation for real-time, high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction. However,\nscaling 3DGS to large and unbounded scenes such as city blocks remains\ndifficult. Existing divide-and-conquer methods alleviate memory pressure by\npartitioning the scene into blocks, but introduce new bottlenecks: (i)\npartitions suffer from severe load imbalance since uniform or heuristic splits\ndo not reflect actual computational demands, and (ii) coarse-to-fine pipelines\nfail to exploit the coarse stage efficiently, often reloading the entire model\nand incurring high overhead. In this work, we introduce LoBE-GS, a novel\nLoad-Balanced and Efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, that re-engineers\nthe large-scale 3DGS pipeline. LoBE-GS introduces a depth-aware partitioning\nmethod that reduces preprocessing from hours to minutes, an optimization-based\nstrategy that balances visible Gaussians -- a strong proxy for computational\nload -- across blocks, and two lightweight techniques, visibility cropping and\nselective densification, to further reduce training cost. Evaluations on\nlarge-scale urban and outdoor datasets show that LoBE-GS consistently achieves\nup to $2\\times$ faster end-to-end training time than state-of-the-art\nbaselines, while maintaining reconstruction quality and enabling scalability to\nscenes infeasible with vanilla 3DGS.",

        "summary": "Photonic crystals enable fine control over light propagation at the\nnanoscale, and thus play a central role in the development of photonic and\nquantum technologies. Photonic band diagrams (BDs) are a key tool to\ninvestigate light propagation into such inhomogeneous structured materials.\nHowever, computing BDs requires solving Maxwell's equations across many\nconfigurations, making it numerically expensive, especially when embedded in\noptimization loops for inverse design techniques, for example. To address this\nchallenge, we introduce the first approach for BD generation based on diffusion\nmodels, with the capacity to later generalize and scale to arbitrary three\ndimensional structures. Our method couples a transformer encoder, which\nextracts contextual embeddings from the input structure, with a latent\ndiffusion model to generate the corresponding BD. In addition, we provide\ninsights into why transformers and diffusion models are well suited to capture\nthe complex interference and scattering phenomena inherent to photonics, paving\nthe way for new surrogate modeling strategies in this domain.",

        "summary": "In industrial inspection and component alignment tasks, template matching\nrequires efficient estimation of a target's position and geometric state\n(rotation and scaling) under complex backgrounds to support precise downstream\noperations. Traditional methods rely on exhaustive enumeration of angles and\nscales, leading to low efficiency under compound transformations. Meanwhile,\nmost deep learning-based approaches only estimate similarity scores without\nexplicitly modeling geometric pose, making them inadequate for real-world\ndeployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight end-to-end\nframework that reformulates template matching as joint localization and\ngeometric regression, outputting the center coordinates, rotation angle, and\nindependent horizontal and vertical scales. A Template-Aware Dynamic\nConvolution Module (TDCM) dynamically injects template features at inference to\nguide generalizable matching. The compact network integrates depthwise\nseparable convolutions and pixel shuffle for efficient matching. To enable\ngeometric-annotation-free training, we introduce a rotation-shear-based\naugmentation strategy with structure-aware pseudo labels. A lightweight\nrefinement module further improves angle and scale precision via local\noptimization. Experiments show our 3.07M model achieves high precision and 14ms\ninference under compound transformations. It also demonstrates strong\nrobustness in small-template and multi-object scenarios, making it highly\nsuitable for deployment in real-time industrial applications.

Most\ndata-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and\nstill suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods\navoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically\ndistributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median\n(M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M\nintroduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent\nsub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional\ninterpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values\ndistorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling\nspace and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is\nemployed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for\nNoise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par\nwith state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently\noutperforming them under correlated noise.

        "summary": "A comprehensive understanding of animal behavior ecology depends on scalable\napproaches to quantify and interpret complex, multidimensional behavioral\npatterns. Traditional field observations are often limited in scope,\ntime-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral\nresponses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan\nAnimal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated\nmulti-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based\nvideo with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial\nmetrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection,\ntracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics,\nincluding time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat\nassociations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods,\ndrone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity,\nreducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher\naccuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies,\nanalyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional\nmethods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras,\nvigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains\nzebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit\nstrong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and\nobserved spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and\ngiraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at\nscale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing\nconservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.",

        "summary": "In this study, we utilized the multimodal capabilities of OpenAI GPT-4o to\nautomatically generate jaw cyst findings on dental panoramic radiographs. To\nimprove accuracy, we constructed a Self-correction Loop with Structured Output\n(SLSO) framework and verified its effectiveness. A 10-step process was\nimplemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis,\nstructured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking,\niterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding\ngeneration with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A\ncomparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought\n(CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure,\nborders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures,\nand tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved\noutput accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates\nfor tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the\nsuccessful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to\nfive regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because\nof the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative\nfinding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number\nidentification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive\nlesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is\nrequired to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding\ngeneration system.",

        "summary": "Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis,\nhowever its adoption in clinical practice is limited by a lack of\ninterpretability. These models often make correct predictions without\nexplaining their reasoning. They may also rely on image regions unrelated to\nthe disease or visual cues, such as annotations, that are not present in\nreal-world conditions. This can reduce trust and increase the risk of\nmisleading diagnoses. We introduce the Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance\nNetwork (GFSR-Net), an approach designed to improve interpretability and\nreliability in medical imaging. GFSR-Net uses a small number of human\nannotations to approximate where a person would focus within an image\nintuitively, without requiring precise boundaries or exhaustive markings,\nmaking the process fast and practical. During training, the model learns to\nalign its focus with these areas, progressively emphasizing features that carry\ndiagnostic meaning. This guidance works across different types of natural and\nmedical images, including chest X-rays, retinal scans, and dermatological\nimages. Our experiments demonstrate that GFSR achieves comparable or superior\naccuracy while producing saliency maps that better reflect human expectations.\nThis reduces the reliance on irrelevant patterns and increases confidence in\nautomated diagnostic tools.",

To address these\nchallenges, we present VLA-R1, a reasoning-enhanced VLA that integrates\nReinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) with Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO) to systematically optimize both reasoning and\nexecution.

Conventional deep learning models, while\npromising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced\nreliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate\noverfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with\nlimited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that\ncombines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for\noral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs\nvariational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty\nquantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by\nsmartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method\nachieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of\nthe training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for\nreal-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations\ndiffering from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior\ngeneralizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94%\nfor traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed\nthat the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly\nclassified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified\nsamples.

Our analysis reveals that policies without\nextrinsics often infer camera pose using visual cues from static backgrounds in\nfixed scenes; this shortcut collapses when workspace geometry or camera\nplacement shifts. Conditioning on extrinsics restores performance and yields\nrobust RGB-only control without depth. We release the tasks, demonstrations,\nand code at https://ripl.github.io/know_your_camera/ .",

        "title": "The Reasoning Boundary Paradox: How Reinforcement Learning Constrains Language Models",
        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key\nmethod for improving Large Language Models' reasoning capabilities, yet recent\nevidence suggests it may paradoxically shrink the reasoning boundary rather\nthan expand it. This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by\nanalyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain\nthis failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to\nsolve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct\nsolutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the\nprobability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we\nuncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces\nproblems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while\nsuppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical\nand empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show\nthat this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL\nobjectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies.\nBased on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation\nalgorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving\nnotable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

        "title": "Consistent Assistant Domains Transformer for Source-free Domain Adaptation",
        "summary": "Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to address the challenge of\nadapting to a target domain without accessing the source domain directly.\nHowever, due to the inaccessibility of source domain data, deterministic\ninvariable features cannot be obtained. Current mainstream methods primarily\nfocus on evaluating invariant features in the target domain that closely\nresemble those in the source domain, subsequently aligning the target domain\nwith the source domain. However, these methods are susceptible to hard samples\nand influenced by domain bias. In this paper, we propose a Consistent Assistant\nDomains Transformer for SFDA, abbreviated as CADTrans, which solves the issue\nby constructing invariable feature representations of domain consistency.\nConcretely, we develop an assistant domain module for CADTrans to obtain\ndiversified representations from the intermediate aggregated global attentions,\nwhich addresses the limitation of existing methods in adequately representing\ndiversity. Based on assistant and target domains, invariable feature\nrepresentations are obtained by multiple consistent strategies, which can be\nused to distinguish easy and hard samples. Finally, to align the hard samples\nto the corresponding easy samples, we construct a conditional multi-kernel max\nmean discrepancy (CMK-MMD) strategy to distinguish between samples of the same\ncategory and those of different categories. Extensive experiments are conducted\non various benchmarks such as Office-31, Office-Home, VISDA-C, and\nDomainNet-126, proving the significant performance improvements achieved by our\nproposed approaches.

Among the\navailable input types, point-based tracking offers an efficient and low-cost\nalternative, yet its reliability and failure cases in complex surgical\nenvironments are not well understood. In this work, we systematically analyze\nthe failure modes of point-based tracking in laparoscopic cholecystectomy\nvideos. Focusing on three surgical targets, the gallbladder, grasper, and\nL-hook electrocautery, we compare the performance of point-based tracking with\nsegmentation mask initialization. Our results show that point-based tracking is\ncompetitive for surgical tools but consistently underperforms for anatomical\ntargets, where tissue similarity and ambiguous boundaries lead to failure.\nThrough qualitative analysis, we reveal key factors influencing tracking\noutcomes and provide several actionable recommendations for selecting and\nplacing tracking points to improve performance in surgical video analysis.",

        "summary": "Quantitative analysis of historical urban sprawl in France before the 1970s\nis hindered by the lack of nationwide digital urban footprint data. This study\nbridges this gap by developing a scalable deep learning pipeline to extract\nurban areas from the Scan Histo historical map series (1925-1950), which\nproduces the first open-access, national-scale urban footprint dataset for this\npivotal period. Our key innovation is a dual-pass U-Net approach designed to\nhandle the high radiometric and stylistic complexity of historical maps. The\nfirst pass, trained on an initial dataset, generates a preliminary map that\nidentifies areas of confusion, such as text and roads, to guide targeted data\naugmentation. The second pass uses a refined dataset and the binarized output\nof the first model to minimize radiometric noise, which significantly reduces\nfalse positives. Deployed on a high-performance computing cluster, our method\nprocesses 941 high-resolution tiles covering the entirety of metropolitan\nFrance. The final mosaic achieves an overall accuracy of 73%, effectively\ncapturing diverse urban patterns while overcoming common artifacts like labels\nand contour lines. We openly release the code, training datasets, and the\nresulting nationwide urban raster to support future research in long-term\nurbanization dynamics.",

This work addresses confidence\ncalibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that\nit is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence\ndistribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the\ncalibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two\nauxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the\ndominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We\nevaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet\nand DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for\ncalibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the\nbest calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and\nsecondary class predictions.

Tools abstract away low-level\nexecution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call\nsearch(query) or create(listing).

As skills develop, the type and frequency of\nstruggles tend to change, and understanding this evolution is key to\ndetermining the user's current stage of learning. However, existing\nmanipulation datasets have not focused on how struggle evolves over time.

The dataset includes 18 tasks grouped\ninto four diverse activities -- tying knots, origami, tangram puzzles, and\nshuffling cards, representing different task variations. In addition,\nparticipants repeated the same task five times to capture their evolution of\nskill. We define the struggle determination problem as a temporal action\nlocalization task, focusing on identifying and precisely localizing struggle\nsegments with start and end times.

The models attain an overall\naverage mAP of 34.56% when generalizing across tasks and 19.24% across\nactivities, indicating that struggle is a transferable concept across various\nskill-based tasks while still posing challenges for further improvement in\nstruggle detection.
