        "summary": "Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable\nprogress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale\nhigh-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training\nstrategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the\nfirst challenge, we introduce \\textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of\n100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual\nfidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on\ndetail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the\nsecond challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that\nenhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we\ndesign (i) \\textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning\non detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \\textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency\nRegularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to\nsoftly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail\npreservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks\ndemonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail\nquality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation.

        "summary": "Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet\nuser-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with\ntraining data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.\nWe present \\textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that\nunifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and\nlarge language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation\nwithout modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \\textbf{Stage 1},\nRetrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with\nsemantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors\nthem to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and\nmulti-object fidelity. \\textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt\nOptimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts\nusing multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,\ntemporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding\nprogressively improved video generation quality. \\textbf{Stage 3} leverages\noptimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing\ntask-specific optimization patterns and enabling efficient, high-quality prompt\ngeneration even before inference. Extensive experiments across five\nstate-of-the-art T2V models and five benchmarks demonstrate that RAPO++\nachieves significant gains in semantic alignment, compositional reasoning,\ntemporal stability, and physical plausibility, outperforming existing methods\nby large margins.

Prior works integrating image\nsegmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ\neither boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These\nmethods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into\ntask-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture\nfine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a\nsegmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally\nproduces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual\ntokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the\nsegmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To\nreduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to\ngenerate required visual tokens in parallel.

By representing both\ninput camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,\nCupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that\nproduces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;\nand (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to\nenhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3\ndB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching\nmonocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity\nover baseline 3D generative models.

        "summary": "Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been\nfueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text\nreports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has\nenabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned\n3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,\nlong-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders\nthat are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs\nfine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce\nBTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder\nthat unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,\nfrequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables\n(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)\nlong-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice\nexcerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional\nmemory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it\nimproves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and\nMerlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared\nto GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically\nconsistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise\nthree-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is\nessential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging.

        "summary": "A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids\nhas proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic\nrenderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and\nshallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow\ncomputations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or\nspecialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens\narray. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we\npropose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only\nsingle images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to\nimplicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our\nmethod reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in\nthe opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a\nneural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our\nneural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input\nimage, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and\nfinally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.\nAfter the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input\nimage, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source\nrays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent\ngeneration of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based\nrendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining\nor finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant\nstate-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.",

        "summary": "Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for\nits powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its\nquadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.\nGiven that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing\nefforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a\npersistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations\nhave not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this\npaper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what\nprinciples give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental\ninsights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research\n(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \\textit{Adaptive routing}:\nSA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic\ncontent, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.\n(2) \\textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token\nweighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,\nwhereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable\nredundancy. Based on this, we propose \\textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),\na principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically\ninjects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\\times3$ kernels, ATConv\nconsistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.\nBuilding on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain\n\\textbf{84.4\\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In\ndiffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\\times\n3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster\nsampling.

        "summary": "3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental\nmonitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To\nefficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR\ndata is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their\nangular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable\nefficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental\ngeometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,\ncompromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR\nIntrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,\nsensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from\nspinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or\ncalibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic\ngeometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters\nincluding laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam\ncalibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud\nreconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the\ncomplete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect\npoint preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric\naccuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing\ngeometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a\ncompression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,\ndemonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This\nparadigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new\npossibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete\ngeometric preservation.",

        "summary": "Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal\nreasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains\non intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,\ncurrent multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They\ntend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,\nleading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often\nimpairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,\nwe propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed\nto address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by\nstructuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a\nthinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking\nbranch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.\nA lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most\nsuitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into\nan MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not\nonly substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the\nmodel's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other\nreasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building\npowerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent\nreasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as\nstate-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While\nthese models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such\nas images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),\ntranslating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open\nchallenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including\nshared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific\narchitectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this\nwork, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a\ngeneral-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable\nextension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent\nspace, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without\nrequiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to\nenforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a\ndomain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in\nlatent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training\ntoward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training\nstrategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs\nand performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape\ngeneration, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.\nComprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our\nframework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.\nFor more information, see our project page:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/lddbm/home.",

        "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in\nmultimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over\ninformation-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with\nfine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely\nlocalizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate\ndispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free\nframework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight\ndraft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as\ndraft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization\ncandidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to\nproduce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering\ncorrect answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a\nconsensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement\nreasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on\nchallenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering\nbenchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.\nBy synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning\npaths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large\nproprietary models or training pipelines.

        "summary": "MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative\nmodeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In\nthis work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two\nparts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient\nanalysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing\noptimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we\nintroduce $\\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory\nflow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting\na curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to\nMeanFlow, $\\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves\nbetter convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K\n256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms\nMeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model\nachieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID\nscores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).",

        "summary": "Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and\ndetail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly\ndue to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of\nimage tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation\n(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion\ntransformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training\ndata, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral\nprogression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures\nconverge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.\nSpecifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each\ndiffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the\ngenerative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions\nthat exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using\nFLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and\nachieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,\nwith gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions.

This, in turn, poses a challenge for\ndeep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a\nbiologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most\nexciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and\nadversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nreconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual\ncortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded\nneurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers\nof the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can\nreconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500\nneurons and less than 1,000 training data points. We also propose a unified\nbenchmark with over 160,000 samples to foster future research.

        "summary": "Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable\ncapabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting\nkey-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that\nfundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache\ncompression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize\nstorage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns\nthat emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first\nanalyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying\nlevels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on\nimportance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information\ndistribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,\nwe propose \\texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity\nfor optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \\texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise\nsemantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when\ncompressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \\texttt{MixKV}\nconsistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme\ncompression (budget=64), \\texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average\nof \\textbf{5.1\\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves\nremarkable gains of \\textbf{8.0\\%} and \\textbf{9.0\\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on\nGUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.\nFurthermore, \\texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable\nperformance gains.

        "summary": "Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and\ntemporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)\ncan process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long\nsequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or\ninconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most\ninformative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal\ndependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide\ncomplete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus\nEvidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video\nunderstanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two\nkey components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module\nselects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM\nreasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns\nembeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus\nRefinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and\nvisual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.\nExtensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and\nrobustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection\nfor Video-LLMs.",

        "summary": "Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without\nindicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3\nhave sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet\nextending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint\ntemporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce\nOpen-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal\nevidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design\ntraining strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model\nhighlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,\nallowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable\nthis functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,\nSTGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed\ntemporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either\ntemporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified\nspatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start\nreinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that\njointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.\nOn V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nraising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent\nimprovements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding\nbenchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond\naccuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable\nsignals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and\nimproving answer reliability.",

To address this, we propose\nACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment\nnetwork that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW\ninputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which\nestimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,\nwhich predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color\nconsistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can\nbe seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines.

However, current methods suffer from a\nlack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation\nis unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of\nconnections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of\nartifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a\nresult, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context\n(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)\nframework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model\nconstruction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide\nfacial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more\nreliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.\nBased on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel\nArtifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery\nexplanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We\npropose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to\nsimultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained\nExplainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,\nFiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA\nperformance on existing XDFA datasets.

        "summary": "Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have\nenabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,\npersonalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge\ndue to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept\ndistributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation\nframework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).\nOur approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step\ndiffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained\nsimultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the\nstudent, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the\nEchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure\nconsistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is\noptimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and\nwith alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.\nFurthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,\nwherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to\nfeedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation\nmechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts\nbut also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms\nexisting personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel\nparadigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.",

However, the validity of fairness auditing\nhinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a\ntheoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI\nreliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.\nTo address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces\nconventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our\ndesign integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear\nclassification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,\nfairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via\nintra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any\ndemographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and\nethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results\nshow that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on\nethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute.

However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a\ncooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning\ncross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and\nrecipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually\napparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the\nrepresentations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting\nin difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of\ningredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is\nexpected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and\nrecipes sourced from different cuisines.

        "summary": "Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and\npossibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data\ncollection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and\ncosts for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in\ncritical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions\nincluding rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is\nan appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the\nconditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real\ndistribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of\nrunway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems\ndeveloped by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach\nbased on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real\nimages. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and\nsynthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve\naccurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse\nconditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real\ndata, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.",

They typically require\nextremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training\nto achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a\nkey source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip\nwith, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at\nmulti-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage\nhyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides\na principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and\ntextual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an\nefficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize\nvisual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary\ngranularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic\nspace. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\\\"{o}bius multiplication\noperations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling\nmatrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible\nyet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across\nmultiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both\nexisting pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\\%\nadditional parameters.",

Prior works largely treats\ninstructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of\ninstruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful\ninvestigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in\ntheir instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction\ndiversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In\nthis paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating\ninstructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives\nand enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.\nTo achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill\nmulti-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to\noptimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and\nUI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding\nbenchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and\nsynthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B\nattains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on\nScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2.

        "summary": "Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from\na single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the\nphysics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image.\nWhile recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning\narchitectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large\nparameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In\nthis work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image\ndehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning\n(GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional\ndeep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze\ncompletely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing\nstep using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green\nlearning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This\narchitecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature\nextraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant\nFeature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a\ncompact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent\nsupervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count\nwhile ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par\nwith state-of-the-art deep learning models.",

Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic\ninconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional\ncues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often\ndominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,\nwhich can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we\npropose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a\nPseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,\nenabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a\nParameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for\nmultimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion\nprocess toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that\nCMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods\nacross four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and\nexhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on\nCH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2.

        "summary": "Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,\nuntrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task\ntypically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection\n(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained\nvision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches\ncommonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,\ndisregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this\napproach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models\noverly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively\nutilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained\ntemporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a\ndual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics\nby routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word\ntokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces\n(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video\nfeatures with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally\ndisentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves\nglobal sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal\ngrounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the\nmodel to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive\nand context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across\nQVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of\ndisentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.",

However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by\nthe approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,\nwhich arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate\ngenerative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the\nparameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,\nand leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate\nquantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more\neffective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose\n\\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \\emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized\ngenerative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective\nimage inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and\nimage style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we\ndevise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \\emph{EditInfinity} to\nperform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic\nalignment to the text prompts.

To overcome the challenge,\nwe propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both\ntextual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal\nprototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update\nweight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to\nflexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic\npriority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire\nvisual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic\nconsistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by\nmultimodal collaborative representation learning.

        "summary": "Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from\npartial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly\nidentical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing\ndiverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations\n-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc\nregularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We\nempirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and\nprototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training\nprototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without\nnecessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint\noptimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns\nprototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model\nprototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,\nindependent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling\neliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields\nconsistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.",

Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)\nsystems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap\nwith a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory\nschema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing\nunder a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open\nmodels with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and\ncross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,\na culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected\nfrom native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image\ncorpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)\nunder country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning\ndepictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing\nerodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;\nand (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)\nrather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source\nidentity for Global-South targets.

        "summary": "Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in\nsound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling\nlarge probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial\nultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.\nTraditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak\nsignals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase\naberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays\nare clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn\ndirectly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and\nnonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but\nquantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture\nconditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage\nframework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first\nstage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to\nmulti-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve\nstructural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based\nsuper-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses\nthese fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A\npartial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set\nimproves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for\nthe missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that\nBrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image\ncompleteness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound\nbrain imaging.",

        "summary": "When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions\nsignificantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise\ncommonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these\nextrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry\npredictions from the model.\n  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering\nmethod. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate\ngradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic\norientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly\naddresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction\nsystems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate\noutside the original training viewpoints.\n  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves\nvisual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance\nField (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays.

In this study, we explore\nthe use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft\nlabels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We\nevaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used\narchitectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS\nconsistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to\nstandard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,\nand teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS\nleads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating\nimproved representation learning.

        "summary": "Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low\nspatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.\nCo-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic\ncameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral\nsuper-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images\n(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but\nrely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the\nMSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided\nself-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of\ndirect regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember\nsignatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer\nperceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed\nby linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the\nMSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable\nintermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a\nsingle-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world\ndatasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art\nunsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against\nsupervised baselines.",

Our work is\nmotivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features\ninherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are\ninsufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we\nintroduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework\nbuilt upon a novel \"compression-aggregation-compression\" architecture. The\nfirst stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary\nprocessor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding\nnetwork to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A\nsubsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a\nfinal semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head\nwith self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative\nembeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer\n(0.95M) variants.

To address these limitations,\nwe present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that\ncontributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation\ncues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of\ncollaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the\ncornerstone for collaboration.

We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing\nvariability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,\nskull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics\nand geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual\ndifferences persist between datasets.

        "summary": "Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for\nreal-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth\nestimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task\nremains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal\nconsistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to\naddress this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental\ntrade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas\ncapturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling\nlong-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo\nmatching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we\npropose a \\textbf{P}ick-and-\\textbf{P}lay \\textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction\nmodule for dynamic \\textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \\textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM\nconsists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a\n`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal\naggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet\nhighly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent\ninformation aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of\nPPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and\ntemporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the\nSintel clean/final (17.3\\% \\& 9.02\\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer\ncomputational costs.

We\nintroduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification\nproblems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates\nfundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference\nstages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical\ndatasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical\ndatasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions\non its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.\nThe Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features\ninto computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy\ndatasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in\ndistinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated\noperators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific\ndomains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease\nstage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation.

        "summary": "Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled\nremarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always\nadopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first\ncorrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image\nunder the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate\nstate in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing\nsource image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the\nspecific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability\nor inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the\nsource. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be\ntarget-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while\npreserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel\ninversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption\nwith learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By\niteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source\nwith dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware\nintermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source\nconsistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves\nsuperior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.",

The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,\ninstance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the\nutilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with\nmany other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic\ncaptions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by\nWikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples.

        "title": "Compress to Impress: Efficient LLM Adaptation Using a Single Gradient Step on 100 Samples",
        "summary": "Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank\nreduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of\ncarefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without\nany gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each\nrequiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid\ndeployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)\nOnly a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --\neliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's\nsingular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the\nfactorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple\nsubspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces\noverfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to\n24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just\n100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the\nindicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to\nfurther reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream\ntasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show\nthat combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for\ndownstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a\nquick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can\nadapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.",

        "summary": "Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural\nnetworks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.\nHowever, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as\nfull-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a\ncost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra\nfine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate\nprecision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address\nthis issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead\nwithout compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared\nbatch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing\nquantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation\ndistributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child\nmodel to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based\nimportance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.\nExperiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and\nViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior\naccuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x.

        "summary": "Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking\ntechniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased\nlegal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content\navailable online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring\ncontent authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works\nassessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark\nforging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and\napplied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we\ninvestigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image\nwatermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a\npreference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is\ntrained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without\nany need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to\nremove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through\nbackpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and\nworks without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much\nsimpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we\nevaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking\nmodels, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,\nquestioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and\nfurther resources are publicly available.",

        "summary": "This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for\nlung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven\nknowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease\ndiagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,\nour method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,\nenabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing\nattention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model\nability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC\nimages. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,\nwhich effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,\nenhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is\nfurther optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the\ntraining procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image\nquality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as\nGamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and\nPix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution\nand feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to\nstandardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale\nfrequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for\nbetter feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model\nfrom a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational\ncost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000\nhistopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images\n(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.",

We argue this stems from two key limitations: the\nlack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data.

AnyPcc first employs a Universal\nContext Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping\nto capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive\nFine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and\nimplicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights\nfor each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal\nbit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry\ncompression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets\nconfirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression.

They exhibit more\nhallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated\nuncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result\nsolely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?\nAfter a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the\nrisk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased\nreliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.\nBuilding on these insights, we propose a novel \"induce-detect-suppress\"\nframework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed\ncontexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,\nand ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual\ndecoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all\nbenchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved\nhallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,\nre-validate our hypothesis on context.

However, existing discrete classification methods fail to\ncapture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early\nintervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion\nProgression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification\nto continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving\nsuspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies\nand cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based\non these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous\nchanges while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce\nSuspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using\nmultimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.\nAdditionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link\nsuspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into\nboth the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive\nexperiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms\nexisting methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.\nNotably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating\nits superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes.

Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of\nmovable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.\n6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,\nbut 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle\nvary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes\nits 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not\nnecessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the\nactual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for\ncategory-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a\nsingle RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and\nrotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the\nrotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body\nframe. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained\nbicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates\nthe 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix\nof synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an\nevaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose\nparameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive\nscores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators\nthat use rigid canonical object templates for matching.",

Computer vision\nmethods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring\nextensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that\nmay overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision\nTransformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive\nobjectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our\ndownstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.\nFor example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on\nModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability\nto understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,\novercomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in\ncapturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global\nshape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through\ncontrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is\ngrounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of\ncombining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.",

However, dental\nimaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic\nartifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity\narising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often\nproves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence\n(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to\nthese issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis\nand treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as\nthe most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature\nextraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent\nprogress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL\nresearch-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260\nstudies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available\ndental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the\nbasic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and\nacquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational\ntechniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to\ndifferent DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization\nstrategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize\ncommonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we\ndiscuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential\nfuture directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic\nreference for researchers in this field.

        "summary": "Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is\na challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed\non graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based\nAsynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled\nby events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce\nreconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that\nregulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving\ncamera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image\ngradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to\nmost existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an\narbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million\nevents/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative\nexperiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction\nbetween FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's\nreconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from\nghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection\nof fiducial markers.

(2025), which compared lengthened partial (pROM) and full\nrange-of-motion (fROM) training across eight upper-body exercises in 26\nparticipants, 280 recordings were processed to extract frame-level joint-angle\ntrajectories. After filtering and smoothing, per-set metrics were derived,\nincluding range of motion (ROM), tempo, and concentric/eccentric phase\ndurations. A random-effects meta-analytic model was applied to account for\nwithin-participant and between-exercise variability. Results show that pROM\nrepetitions were performed with a smaller ROM and shorter overall durations,\nparticularly during the eccentric phase of movement. Variance analyses revealed\nthat participant-level differences, rather than exercise-specific factors, were\nthe primary driver of variation, although there is substantial evidence of\nheterogeneous treatment effects. We then introduce a novel metric, \\%ROM, which\nis the proportion of full ROM achieved during pROM, and demonstrate that this\ndefinition of lengthened partials remains relatively consistent across\nexercises. Overall, these findings suggest that lengthened partials differ from\nfull ROM training not only in ROM, but also in execution dynamics and\nconsistency, highlighting the potential of AI-based methods for advancing\nresearch and improving resistance training prescription.",
