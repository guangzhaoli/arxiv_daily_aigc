However,\nexisting approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and\nstruggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose\nGEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates\nexpressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial\nexpressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion\ntransformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables\nidentity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions.\nGEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for\ninformation sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the\ngeneration process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated\nfine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared\nto previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the\ngenerated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of\nthe target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.",

The first,\na 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a\nsingle person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity\nrepresentation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid\ncloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and\nimpractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,\nlearns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but\nstruggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.\nWe present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches\nto obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a\nsingle image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate\npose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.\nTo ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we\nintroduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced\nsampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in\ndiffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes\ngeometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse\nposes.",

LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a\nlinear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a\nnovel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial\ndynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'\napproaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X\nto support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise\nmanipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This\nhelps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and\nexpression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully\ntraining a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on\nextensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method\noutperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment\ntasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and\ncontrollable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as\nfine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait\nvideo manipulation.",

        "summary": "Existing video recommender systems rely primarily on user-defined metadata or\non low-level visual and acoustic signals extracted by specialised encoders.\nThese low-level features describe what appears on the screen but miss deeper\nsemantics such as intent, humour, and world knowledge that make clips resonate\nwith viewers. For example, is a 30-second clip simply a singer on a rooftop, or\nan ironic parody filmed amid the fairy chimneys of Cappadocia, Turkey? Such\ndistinctions are critical to personalised recommendations yet remain invisible\nto traditional encoding pipelines. In this paper, we introduce a simple,\nrecommendation system-agnostic zero-finetuning framework that injects\nhigh-level semantics into the recommendation pipeline by prompting an\noff-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to summarise each clip\ninto a rich natural-language description (e.g. \"a superhero parody with\nslapstick fights and orchestral stabs\"), bridging the gap between raw content\nand user intent. We use MLLM output with a state-of-the-art text encoder and\nfeed it into standard collaborative, content-based, and generative\nrecommenders. On the MicroLens-100K dataset, which emulates user interactions\nwith TikTok-style videos, our framework consistently surpasses conventional\nvideo, audio, and metadata features in five representative models. Our findings\nhighlight the promise of leveraging MLLMs as on-the-fly knowledge extractors to\nbuild more intent-aware video recommenders.",

        "summary": "The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite\nimage to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent\ndiffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable\nresults. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail\npreservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic\ndatasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to\ncapture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization\ncapabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting\ninformation from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach\npreserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,\ngenerating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model\nR2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in\nthe foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.\nTo further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with\nMask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the\nforeground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background\nregions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random\nPoisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a\nsuitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and\nchallenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic\ndataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over\nother methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our\ndataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our\ncode, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.",

        "title": "BridgeTA: Bridging the Representation Gap in Knowledge Distillation via Teacher Assistant for Bird's Eye View Map Segmentation",
        "summary": "Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and\nchallenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn\nattention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind\nLiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been\nexplored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student\nmodel by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference\ncost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective\ndistillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and\nCamera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the\nstudent's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network\ncombines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared\nlatent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the\nframework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's\nInequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into\nteacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and\nstrengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging\nnuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an\nimprovement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than\nthe improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image\ngeneration. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,\nstate-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,\nespecially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global\ndistribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual\nsamples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance\ngeneration quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing\noutliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its\nmisalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,\nwe propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving\nperceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify\nlow-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure\nmodes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from\npoor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings\nconsistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also\nshows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.",

        "summary": "Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing\nattention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious\nconcerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have\nachieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when\nfacing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,\nsince they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this\nlimitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.\nMotivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity\nto their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely\nSemantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic\ndifference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The\nhypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully\ncapture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts\nduring the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,\nwhich closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By\nquantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative\nfeature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically\ndemonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization,\noutperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and\nCommunityForensics.",

To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,\nend-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent\nrepresentation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on\nlarge-scale, diverse human motion datasets.

First, they\ncan complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy\nor multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.\nSecond, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often\ncontains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text\ndescriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds\nand long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image\nalignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale\nsynthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image\ndata to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we\nfine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.\nIn addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and\nchallenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which\nincreases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and\nImagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and\ngeneration of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance\nacross standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other\nfoundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains\nacross multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.",

To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf\nlanguage model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.\nTo evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain\nnarratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded\nstorytelling, in addition to consistency.

Despite the improvements of\nthis approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in\ncomputation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.\nGiven the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve\nits benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose\none solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge\ninto a model during post-training.

        "summary": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a leading modality for the diagnosis of\nliver cancer, significantly improving the classification of the lesion and\npatient outcomes. However, traditional MRI faces challenges including risks\nfrom contrast agent (CA) administration, time-consuming manual assessment, and\nlimited annotated datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a\nTime-Conditioned Autoregressive Contrast Enhancement (T-CACE) framework for\nsynthesizing multi-phase contrast-enhanced MRI (CEMRI) directly from\nnon-contrast MRI (NCMRI). T-CACE introduces three core innovations: a\nconditional token encoding (CTE) mechanism that unifies anatomical priors and\ntemporal phase information into latent representations; and a dynamic\ntime-aware attention mask (DTAM) that adaptively modulates inter-phase\ninformation flow using a Gaussian-decayed attention mechanism, ensuring smooth\nand physiologically plausible transitions across phases. Furthermore, a\nconstraint for temporal classification consistency (TCC) aligns the lesion\nclassification output with the evolution of the physiological signal, further\nenhancing diagnostic reliability. Extensive experiments on two independent\nliver MRI datasets demonstrate that T-CACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nin image synthesis, segmentation, and lesion classification. This framework\noffers a clinically relevant and efficient alternative to traditional\ncontrast-enhanced imaging, improving safety, diagnostic efficiency, and\nreliability for the assessment of liver lesion.

        "summary": "Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on\nRGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on\nadequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range.\nEvent cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and\nhigh dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene\nreconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this\nend, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting\napproach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with\nfast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization\nscheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting\nfor time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance\npruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while\nincorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We\ndesign a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras\nsurrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark\nmulti-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our\napproach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves\nthe way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel\napproach for rapid scene capture.",

        "summary": "Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to\nfacilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant\nspatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation.\nPrevious discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time,\nand degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior\nperformance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video\nVAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between\ndiscrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively\npreserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization\nmethods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster\nthan training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.\nMeanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how\ncontinuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we\nintroduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB\nimprovement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,\nto tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we\nstrengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this\ninformation in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x\n16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous\noptimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,\nachieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete\nrepresentations within a single network.

In this paper, we\npropose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to\neffectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a\nregularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its\nkernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure\nits effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct\na reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,\n1$\\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like\nstructure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional\nconvolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,\nleading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image\nrestoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants\nof ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,\nrespectively.

        "summary": "The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large\nmodels from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon\nautoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive\nModel (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the\njoint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world\nknowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without\nrequiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent\naction trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames\nand actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and\nfacilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with\ninverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further\nimprove performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show\nthat PAR achieves a 100\\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the\nperformance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately\npredicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings\nunderscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world\nknowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.",

We think that mixing\nboth types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and\nmeanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate\non motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward\nyet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human\naction. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages\nof two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic\nvideo-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in\nthe model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human\nbehavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that\ncontains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We\ndeveloped ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled\nsamples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show\nthat ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion\nunderstanding, and behavior interpretation.",

Extensive experiments on three\nexisting dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets\ndemonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the\ntask of future frame extrapolation.

One caveat of this methodology is the\nrequirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently\nrequires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep\nlearning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies\non a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of\n\\textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue,\nfrom specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and\n\\textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding\nmasks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen\nphotographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not\nseen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual\nlabels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved\na median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\\%\nHausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.\nOur tool is publicly available at surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/PhotoTools.",

Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics\napplications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods\nstruggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific\nfeatures, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this\nwork, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention\n(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based\nSISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached\nafter the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map\nattention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability\nof the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and\nHMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map\nconsistency.

It aims to continually learn new\nconcepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the\nsame time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective\napproach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal\nmodifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,\nwe synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each\nTransformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the\npre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and\ndynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy\ntransfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we\nleverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse\nsemantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then\nadaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top\nof the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat\nstate-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct\nextensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our\nDSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than\nexisting approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic\nforgetting issue as well.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the\nperformance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing\nmethods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the\nreference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of\nrelying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we\npropose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal\nattention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for\nreference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).\nOur model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and\nintroduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention\nweighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an\nadditional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,\neffectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level\ncolor alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving\nsuperior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.",

However, existing\nmethods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial\nfeatures and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure\ninherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled\ndata. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that\ncombines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach\nintegrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that\npreserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial\nregions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination\nwith multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that\npreserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2\nmillion unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant\nimprovements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and\nlighting conditions.

Most current methods\nin point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D\nmotion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising\na function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised\nstate-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose\nparametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field\n(InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical\nscenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a\nrendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel\ncorrespondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to\nobtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a\ndefined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our\nmulti-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient\npixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and\nSCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of\nkinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our\napproach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art\nmethods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other\napproaches.

Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed\nidentity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face\nimages, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods\noften lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability,\nleading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal\nFR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method\nthat incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion\nprocess. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative\nconditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while\npreserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nNegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of\ndata generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity\nseparability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from\n2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the\nNegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without\nnegative conditions across multiple benchmarks.",

However, due to the variable size and complex lesion\nboundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging.\nRecently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable\nperformance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's\ninteraction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts\n(points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world\napplications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are\nautomatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when\nperforming segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid\ngland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM\nincorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion\nsegmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided\nprompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information\ncontaining the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion\nsegmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module,\nwhich integrates the complementary information of different modalities to\nenhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and\ngenerated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result.\nExperimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent\nclinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness\nof diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical\nsettings.",

A further\ncontribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from\nchest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We\nperformed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,\nscalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11\nclinicians.

        "summary": "Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in\ncomputer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent\nadvancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,\nhead editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due\nto the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and\nglobal appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head\nAvatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the\ngeometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled\ntexture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two\ntypes of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance\nof head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture\nediting, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of\nnon-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence\nbetween 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping\nmethod, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp\ntexture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization\nstrategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both\nreconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble\ndataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results,\nbut also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian\nhead avatars and support real-time appearance editing.",

        "summary": "Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer\nfrom hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or\nestablished world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality\nhallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness\nhallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained\nanalysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or\nreused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To\naddress these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline\nthat produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also\ndesign a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input\nperturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs,\nwe construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to\nassess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained\nhallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction\npairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and\n6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios.\nExtensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality\nhallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.",

However, these models\noften struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture\nfine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address\nthese challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)\nsystem that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models.\nThe proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that\nrecursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given\nappearance information and the user's intent.

We present\nWeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes\nweather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the\ntext context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a\nTraining-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large\nmulti-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through\nhuman-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,\nand could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the\nscene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the\ndynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight\nand fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized\nby the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and\nimage-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather\nconditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate\nthat, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall\nrates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods.

        "summary": "With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of\nAI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images,\nwhich inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the\nconventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs\n(generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection\nperformance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed\na universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly\ndetection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a\ngeneralizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use\nthe pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing\nflow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by\napplying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for\ntraining. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images,\noptionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by\nvarious image generators.",

        "summary": "Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under\nlarge facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in\nexploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT\nstructure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing\nopen-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations.\nFirst, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically\ncombines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to\ncapture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The\nidentity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic\nexpert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves\npixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to\nmitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline\ncentered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face\nConstraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial\nregions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features\nacross temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial\nangles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this\npipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from\nexisting open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with\nannotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate\nthat our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior\nSOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment.

        "summary": "Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a\n``zero-shot\" task, training on images generated by known models but\ngeneralizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model\nperforms poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for\nanalysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot\" task,\nwhere effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant\nimprovement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,\ndeepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world\ndistributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network\n(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet\ndiffers from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for\ntraining. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,\nmimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be\ngathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,\neach test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is\nclassified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a\ncomprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative\nmodels and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\\%\ncompared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on\nreal-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a\nfew-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.",

However, security issues in visual\ngrounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of\nbackdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor\nattack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This\nattack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,\nregardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that\nembeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the\noriginal image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the\nopen-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we\nutilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned\nand clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating\nattack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its\nfeasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches\nover 65\\% on various testing sets.

        "summary": "Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a\nreference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in\nrecent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which\nusually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in\nindustries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could\nonly generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the\nvideos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute\nthis limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to\ncomprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose\nsequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes\nAnimate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character\ntypes, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,\nwe introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern\nfrom the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former\nleverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of\nmotion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,\nwhile the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible\ninputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we\nintroduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and\nTI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this\napproach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background\ndynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new\nAnimated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of\nAnimate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images.

However, their direct application to hyperspectral\nremote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the\nscarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel\nknowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned\nrepresentations from a teacher model into a student model for effective\ndevelopment of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical\nknowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a\nsimpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across\ndifferent types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building\nupon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi\nfoundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.\nHyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by\nintroducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel\nalignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function\ntailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral\ndomain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for\ngeospatial applications.

However, a critical limitation of existing\nRefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image\npairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To\novercome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new\nand practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant\nhigh-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality\ninput. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as\nenhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where\ncategory-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily\ncollected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we\nconstruct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike\nprior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides\nper-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval.

To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net,\na novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically\nfuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed\napproach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities\nsynchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network,\nfeatures from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based\nfusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the\noutputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble\nclassification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments\ndemonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches\nwith a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for\nItalian Sign Language.

To address\nthese drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous\nmodel, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodel (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary\nDPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a\nbetter trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on\nthe public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves\n8$\\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\\times$ lower\nGPU memory consumption, and 14$\\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.\nMoreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.\nWe also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing\nthe advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the\nproposed method.

Given a language instruction,\nthese models process observation and navigation history to predict the most\nappropriate action for an agent.

In this work, we propose a novel\ninput-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show\nthat existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without\nsubstantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three\nadaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial\nefficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an\nagent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based\nadaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal\nefficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of\nviews previously seen by the agent.

Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual\nfeatures, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also\nincreasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias.

Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally\nlimited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over\nUnion (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches\nreal-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association\nstruggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To\naddress these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT\ntracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter\n(MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches\nbetween assumed and actual object motion.

To enhance the adaptability of these models under\ncomplex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure\nCorrection method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we\nintroduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment\nModule (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure\nconsistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses\nmiscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to\nrecognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the\nlight-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the\nExposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes\nlow-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing\nhigh-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain\ndetails. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction\nand enhances detail recovery.

        "summary": "Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for\nUnmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification\nof 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive\n3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the\nlimited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to\nreduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose\nCitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation\nthat incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and\nzero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of\nnon-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data\npreprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to\nenhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To\nresolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a\nhierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established\naccording to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the\ngraph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between\ncategories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ\nhinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing\napproaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot\ngeneralization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual\ninformation.",

Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from\nimproving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to\ngenerating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with\nmathematical guarantees.

This performance metric has\nbecome critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI\nadoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the\nneuromorphic computing paradigm.

In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline\ncalled RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model\nperformance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated\nGoogle Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb\nramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images.

In\nthis work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion\nsegmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due\nto annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors.

However, the rise of\nasymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this\nassumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo\nmatching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we\nexplore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume\nconstruction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume\nexperiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be\ncomprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the\ntwo-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching\n(IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the\ncorrelation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine\ndetails. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance\nagainst significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on\nbenchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of\nour approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.",

In this work, we answer\ntwo questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the\nill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements.\nTo this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and\ntheoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with\nminimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks'\nsuperiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents,\ncalled explicit measurement representations.

To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts\nhigh-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions.

Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these\nissues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a\ndual-architecture framework.

For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a\nMulti-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that\ncaptures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to\ncomprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging\nIsharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The\nproposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on\nthe SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art.

        "summary": "Recent advances in histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLFMs)\nhave shown promise in addressing data scarcity for whole slide image (WSI)\nclassification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain\noutperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches\ntrained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI\nclassification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot\nmethods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on\nconventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data\nscarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)\ncomprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes\na classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a\nclassifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic\npathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC\noutperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the\nTCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art\nfew-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions,\noffering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic\ntraining data is severely limited.

So much\nso that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and\nAfrican Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International\nUnion for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their\nivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic\nmodification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that\nthough poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather\ndynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several\nother factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts\nin poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from\n2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again --\nWWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached\nannually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near\ntowns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of\nthese factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify\npoaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable\npoaching regions.

Due to the strong\ncapacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy\nlabels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on\nmitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust\nloss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of\nregularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization\nused in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection\nMasking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and\nKANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The\nmechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by\nevaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis,\nwe demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be\nseamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more\nrobust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection\nstrategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both\nsynthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently\noutperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the\nfirst to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their\nsuperior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios.

        "title": "Plane Detection and Ranking via Model Information Optimization",
        "summary": "Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic\napplications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample\nConsensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic\nguarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it\nsusceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly\nprevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is\nunknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on\nmodel information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the\nobserved depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability\ndistributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing\ndifferent candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated\nrandom sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics\nand noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each\nmodel, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely\nground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective\nmechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false\npositive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be\nranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We\nvalidate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that\nour algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the\ndefault Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our\nalgorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,\nwhich enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in\nreal-world data.",

        "summary": "Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works\nface two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are\nunsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated\ntext lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the\nresults. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which\nnot only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides\nbasis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of\ndiagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically\naccurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via\ndiagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language\nmodel with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a\ndiagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated\nsentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding\nmodule is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the\nworking efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we\npropose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to\nleverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead\nto 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a\nevaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion\nlocation and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist\nmodels consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by\naccurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.",

For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their\nratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The\nresulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,\nand SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.\n  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,\noutperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The\ntopological features showed high accuracy with low variance.\n  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal\ndigital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,\ninterpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when\nexplainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can\napply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,\nand interpretable AI.

        "summary": "Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a\nlong-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its\nvariants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing\nmethods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with\nrational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization\ncapability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,\nbut they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to\nlimited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric\ninconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel\nself-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable\n3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for\nimproved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and\nradiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need\nfor ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency\nModule (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via\nconsistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy\nthat refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization\nmethods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.\nIt also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to\n1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong\ncross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.",

        "summary": "Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires\nagents to follow natural language instructions through free-form 3D spaces.\nExisting VLN-CE approaches typically use a two-stage waypoint planning\nframework, where a high-level waypoint predictor generates the navigable\nwaypoints, and then a navigation planner suggests the intermediate goals in the\nhigh-level action space. However, this two-stage decomposition framework\nsuffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each\nstage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the\nquality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,\nwe propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE\npolicy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and\nplanning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional\ndiffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future\nactions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint\npredictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible\ninstruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in\nimitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation\ntasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory\naugmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This\napproach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to\nrecover from error states. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that, even without a waypoint predictor, the proposed method\nsubstantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art two-stage waypoint-based\nmodels in terms of navigation performance.

A motion triggered IP camera uploads\nshort clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are\nlocalized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an\nEfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a\nlarger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a\ndiscrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder\nuses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers.\nDetector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame\nclassification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the\ncurated subset (about 99.5 percent) and delivers practical field accuracy\n(top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for\ncitizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.",

In this paper, we\npropose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective\nto deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a\ncarefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2\nis a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and\nphase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which\nenables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra.

        "summary": "Human-robot teaming (HRT) systems often rely on large-scale datasets of human\nand robot interactions, especially for close-proximity collaboration tasks such\nas human-robot handovers. Learning robot manipulation policies from raw,\nreal-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the\nphysical environment. Although simulation training offers a cost-effective\nalternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace\nremains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies,\nfocusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need\nfor real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable\nthe robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while\navoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages\nsparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes\nto generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a\ncamera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose\nchanges in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose\nchanges. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and\nreal-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method\nserves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover\ntask, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT.",

Building upon these insights, we adopt natural\nlanguage as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the\nfirst semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI\nchallenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective\njudgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise\nsemantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking\nfinding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively\nexploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or\neven performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we\npropose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as\nexternal cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB\ntrackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic\ncognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant\nadvancement over existing VLT methods.

Previous\napproaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain\nadaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance\nwhen applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal\nCollaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).\nSpecifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that\ncreate a universal representation space and then collaborate with\nsource-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing\ncomplementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging\ncross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for\nsmall-batch or unseen data scenarios.

        "summary": "Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural\ndevelopment and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal\ncomplications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of\nstandard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and\npersonalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and\nunclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for\nfine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast\nFusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed\ninformation from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower\nlayers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By\nassigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast\nconditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining\nminimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a\ncurated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a\nminimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast\nattention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,\ncontributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.\nConclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal\ntorso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature\nrepresentation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports\nclinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating\nstrong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening.

        "summary": "This study proposes a real-time system that translates voluntary eye blinks\ninto Morse code, enabling communication for individuals with severe motor\nimpairments. Using a standard webcam and computer vision, the system detects\nand classifies blinks as short (dot) or long (dash), then decodes them into\nalphanumeric characters. Experiments with five participants show 62% decoding\naccuracy and 18-20 seconds response times, demonstrating a viable, low-cost\nassistive communication method.",
