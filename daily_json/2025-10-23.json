        "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided\nimage editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting\nnew benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained\nby the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets\nbuilt from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive\n400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is\nconstructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real\nphotographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K\nfrom previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and\ndiversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure\ncomprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content\npreservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring\nand careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables\nresearch into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized\nsubsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential\nediting, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a\n56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;\nand (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction\nrewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,\nhigh-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust\nfoundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided\nimage editing models.",

        "summary": "General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong\ncapabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,\ntheir performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively\nstraightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,\nspecialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process\nthat progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we\nconstruct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second\nissue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process\nfor disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds\nzoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the\ncrucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in\nenhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the\nGRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective\nreasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent\ngeneral-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization.

        "summary": "Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in\nmedical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data\naugmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often\ndistort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both\ndiagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is\nconsequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological\nchanges carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear\nStructure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly\npreserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by\nintegrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments\nbaseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological\nsupervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We\nintegrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.\nComprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence\ntomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography\ndemonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned\nmappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear\nstructure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.",

        "summary": "Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually\nlimitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real\ndatasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models\non three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt\nengineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic\nimpact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains\nunderexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to\nmotivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain\nthe observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new\nevaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic\ndata, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences\nthe utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct\nour study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and\nevaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic\nexperiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than\nthe other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not\nlearned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that\nincreasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt\nconsistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which\naligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time\ninterventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of\nmoving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt\nexpansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood\nestimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image\ndiversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.",

        "summary": "While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant\nprogress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major\nchallenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce\nadditional data for further training or incorporate external or internal\ninformation during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce\nextra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the\nmodel's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As\na result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn\nexacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we\npropose \\textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that\nleverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical\nvisual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation\nin MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs\nnearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be\nseamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those\nspecifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on\nseveral widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream\nMLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the\neffectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly\navailable.",

In this study, we\nleverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction\nto proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient\ncare, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel\nframework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,\nwhich then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly\nunder-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model\nconditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously\nscanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate\nthis approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using\npredictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using\npredictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on\ninternal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),\nincluding multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors\n(x4, x8 and x12).

        "title": "GRASPLAT: Enabling dexterous grasping through novel view synthesis",
        "summary": "Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a\nsignificant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to\npredict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of\nacquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we\nintroduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D\ninformation while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that\nby synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we\ncan regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve\nthis, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of\nreal hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.\nUnlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines\ngrasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping\ndatasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%\nover existing image-based methods.

        "summary": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective\nalignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different\nmodalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of\nHuman-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many\ndownstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,\nHuman-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or\nembeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh\nmodels, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where\nthe correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched\nusing a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human\nPose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from\nimages, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at\nthe same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning\nloss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and\n3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with\na simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:\nMPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset\nwith cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose\nretrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,\nwhere the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.",

To tackle these issues, we propose \\textbf{C}lass-Aware\n\\textbf{P}rototype \\textbf{L}earning with \\textbf{N}egative\n\\textbf{C}ontrast(\\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed\nspecifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.\nCPL-NC introduces a \\textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that\ndynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and\nactivation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to\nretain rare-category knowledge.

However, existing methods\noften face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of\nactivations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.\nTo address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware\nQuantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a\ndifferentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight\nquantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based\ninitialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the\ninitial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based\non Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;\nand (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For\nactivations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping\nscheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On\nImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an\naverage bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods\nunder comparable conditions.

        "summary": "Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their\nexceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent\n\\textit{multi-step iterations} and \\textit{complex backbone networks} lead to\nprohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major\nbottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration\ntechniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited\napplicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.\n  Against this backdrop, \\textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising\ntraining-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its\ncore mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in\nthe diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and\ninter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model\nparameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and\nevolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its\nclassification and analysis.\n  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that\nDiffusion Caching evolves from \\textit{static reuse} to \\textit{dynamic\nprediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and\nenables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling\noptimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient\ninference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We\nargue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient\ngenerative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of\n\\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.",

In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a\nspatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to\nfocus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,\nenabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon\nvideo prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the\nmost physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and\nrefine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to\nenforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments\non five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including\nchaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic\ndimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background\nperturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among\nCNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines.

        "summary": "Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for\nautonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly\nlearned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While\nrecent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,\nthe synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still\nrequires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm\nnamed Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and\ntrajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit\nplanning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free\nfuture state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,\nPWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable\nplanning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we\nfurther introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,\nequipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.\nDespite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds\nstate-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.\nCode and model weights will be released at\nhttps://github.com/6550Zhao/Policy-World-Model.",

However, in real-world applications,\ndifferences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead\nto domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation\nand reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to\ntwo key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules\ndisrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)\naccommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.\nTo address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication\nmechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous\nmulti-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original\nnetwork, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to\nefficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored\nDeformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each\ncollaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The\nSpatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,\ngenerates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving\nthe spatial information of the collaborators.

They\nare implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse\nsignal representation, or by minimising their $\\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse\nestimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal\nregularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\\bf C^\\alpha$\ncurves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz\nexponent $\\alpha \\leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural\nnetworks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the\nminimax asymptotic bounds for all $\\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients\nhave been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They\nare computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second\nwavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and\nmaximising the $\\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.\nWe prove that these $\\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image\nregularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches\nthe minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents\n$\\alpha \\leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.\nIt provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from\nsignals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions.

Earth Observation (EO) represents a\nquintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote\nsensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data\nintroduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor\nmodalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex\nbased on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this\ncontext, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the\nvast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve\nsingle-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research\nefforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular\ndownstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To\naddress this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of\ngeneralizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for\ninference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative\nlearning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal\nmodel manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We\nevaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and\nregression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the\nmodalities available during training is accessible at inference time.

Due to the\nsurround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to\nensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To\ntackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned\nexplicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the\nelevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end\nlearning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable\ngeometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture\nto efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the\ngeometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale\ngeometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which\nshares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate\nmulti-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly\nsupervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through\nfeature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our\napproach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective\nmetrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's\nscalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.",

In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark\nevaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures\nand proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We\nstudy the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task\nunder controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are\nhighly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,\nand the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors\nare due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output\nspace. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer\nimproves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving\nconsistent improvements on real-world datasets.",

        "summary": "Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains\na critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle\nwith image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to\naddress this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and\nselecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated\nframes are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection\nstrategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve\nthese cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer\nintermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a\npose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature\nMatching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate\nframes appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive\nexperiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate\nthat, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the\npose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.",

This challenge is compounded by data\nscarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.\nThis study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)\nframework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely\ncontrolled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and\ndata availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section\nsamples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,\nsimultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a\nsingle unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network\nprinciples and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone\nfabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures\nwith anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control\n(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.\nMorphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network\ncharacteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and\ntortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological\ntolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior\nrepresentativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to\n36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides\ntransformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for\ncarbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications\nwhere knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for\nimplementing digital rock physics.",

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional\nperformance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their\napplication to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological\nanalysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a\nmulti-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through\nhierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing\non the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in\nclinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances\ninto semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical\nrepresentation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:\nsingle-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze\nthese sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting\npsychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce\nan HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with\nreinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object\nlevel analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and\ndynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),\ncorrelating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these\nmulti-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns\nwith expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and\nspecialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework\nfor understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the\ncapability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a\ngeneral framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.",

        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots\nto perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the\nfoundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most\nevaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to\nintegrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera\nsetups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide\ncomplementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether\nVLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning\ntherefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nMV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view\nspatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench\nconsists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into\ntwo primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We\nevaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and\nclosed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired\ntechniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below\nhuman performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in\nmulti-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key\nfindings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively\ncorrelated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on\nexisting general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not\nreliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our\nbenchmark.

In this\nwork, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations\nthat disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D\ngeometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus\nsubstantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to\navoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.\nTo overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify\nthe spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.\nBuilding upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a\nPerturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the\npre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an\nunauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the\nsensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving\nrendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use.

The proposed\nframework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed\nby segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,\npixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular\nvalue decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered\nusing hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The\nnumber of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular\nvalues. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded\ninto image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP.

        "summary": "Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's\nfinal semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a\nparameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich\nobject information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the\nbrain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a\nparameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual\nsystem's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE\npathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas\n(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,\nrespecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction\nstrategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves\nhighly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic\nmetrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including\nthose using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer\nparameters, demonstrating a reduction of\n71.7\\%(Table.\\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA\nmethods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,\nit effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,\nstriking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity\nwithout requiring a separate VAE pipeline.",

As an emerging\nsensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,\nand accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object\ndetection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object\ngeometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we\nintroduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided\nby surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from\nimage and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial\nrepresentation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction\nof fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an\nimage branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective\nview (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving\nspatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate\ndense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original\nradar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point\ncloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the\nfeatures into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head\nare used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.\nExperimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar\nfeatures, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft\n(VoD) object detection benchmarks.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of\nExperts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework\nintegrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.\nOur router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric\nGaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight\nsplatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS\nimproves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are\ninherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two\ncomplementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware\nGaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a\ndistillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,\nenabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes.

Existing methods primarily focus\non metrics related to generation quality and controllability.

Existing\nmethods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic\ndata and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the\nbaseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the\nbenefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the\nbenefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data\ngeneration framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.\nDream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance\nmaps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps.

        "summary": "Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach\nto improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without\nrequiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to\nspecific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at\nenhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as\naesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of\nthe generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to\nimage-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose\nVideo Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal\nconsistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.\nTo achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD\nis defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame\ninformation effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results\nacross multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation\nmodel with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading\nother performance compared to the previous method.",

        "summary": "In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain\ntumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a\ntransformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D\nbrain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,\nstandard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor\nregions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous\nboundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on\nhigh-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high\ncomputational resources and often faces challenges associated with class\nimbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into\nthe 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and\nprioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a\ntumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is\nutilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.\nThis study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,\nultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is\nthoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various\nperformance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that\nthe model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity\nof 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed\nmodel in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for\nreliable diagnosis in clinical settings.",

We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible\nwithout sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained\njointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient\nvectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to\nclustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge\nvectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,\nand a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy\nloss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,\nexploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across\nmultiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs\nand ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction\nof up to 80$\\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy.

        "summary": "While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image\ndescription, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,\nSPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now\nuncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require\nsensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize\nerrors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for\ndetailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to\nguide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained\nerrors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,\ninterpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics\n(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new\ndataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with\nexpert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with\ngranular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,\nDOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed\nimage description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh\nachieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\\rho$) with the human judgments\nin DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type\n(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward\nfunction, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we\ncharacterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the\npaintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models\nstruggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene\ndynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both\nPoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as\nassistive text generation.",

A\nkey reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that\nnatural videos often entail.

In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our\napproach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,\nusing 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall\naccuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to\n66.85%.

Using controlled experiments\ntargeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs\nexhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single\nfeature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)\nsearch. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate\nnatural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We\nreinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic\ninterpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a\ncognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in\nMLLMs.",

        "summary": "To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it\nis crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay\ncontextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training\ntransformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,\nvisual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans\ncan maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.\nSignificant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is\nirrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly\nfocus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with\nfull-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based\narchitecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on\nmemory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and\nretrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the\ninputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a\ngridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in\nphoto-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context\ntransformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.\nAdditionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and\nremains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be\ntruncated to fit inference constraints.",

        "summary": "Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data\nscarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary\nambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient\ndiscrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking\" vs.\n``throwing\" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency\nAugmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima\ncaused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and\nsemantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)\nit resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing\nannotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)\nit preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by\ntraining while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving\nperformance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with\ncold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum\nlearning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.\nThe distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain\nDETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,\nwhile Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A\ncross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base\nQueries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world\ngeneralization.

Leveraging their complementary strengths can\nsubstantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as\nhigh-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.\nHowever, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two\nmodalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering\neffective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose\n{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge\ndistillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal\nasymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that\nminimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's\ncomputational efficiency and parameter compactness.

We\naddress this challenge with Time-Aware $\\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space\narchitecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously\nencodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while\nremaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time\nselective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time\ndifference between exams into its state transitions.

        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot\nperformance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the\nextent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains\nunderexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential\nfor interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first\nsystematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest\nX-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations\nusing cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and\nquantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across\nmultiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants\ndemonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,\ntheir performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)\nmodels that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved\nalignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall\nrecognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.\nThese findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition\nability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the\nneed for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical\npractice.

If not addressed, these\nmissing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction\nmodels. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and\nthe number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to\nassociate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with\nthe label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We\nevaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the\ncoverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme\nduring training that removes the association between the label and the coverage\nby enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both\nresampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias\nwithout hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate\nthe capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational\nscenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of\ndetecting plumes in low-coverage images.",

        "summary": "Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse\nproblem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While\ncontemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial\nreasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each\nsequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural\nregularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across\nsequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network\n(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of\npattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory\nbank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as\nrelational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism\nto provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded\nanatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring\ngeometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust\nspatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that\nsynergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of\nMamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of\nself-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks\ndemonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE\nof 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain\ngeneralization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism\nof cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the\nparadigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.",

However, due to domain shift and limited\ndomain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious\ncorrelations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic\nclassification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant\nrepresentations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we\npropose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a\nCross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by\nintegrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate\ndomain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts\nfor single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that\ndisentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via\nhigh-frequency feature extraction.

This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world\nconditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result\nin data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general\npublic imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open\nimbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.\nSecond, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and\nclass-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant\ndifficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced\ndatasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14\ndataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI\nsystems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is\ncharacterized by its unique \"intra-class clusters\" property, which presents two\nmajor challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.\nThese characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,\nsignificantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers\nfor highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,\nwhich follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional\nchannel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining\nstrategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental\nevaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art\nmodels on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and\ncompetitiveness on general public datasets.",

        "summary": "With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the\nworld. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is\nessential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among\nthem, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach\npossible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a\nwarehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has\nlimitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is\nnecessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19\nwide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the\nlogistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera\ncoordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment\nbased on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle\ncameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly\nin the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from\neach camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image\ndistortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a\nresult, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.\nFurthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and\nvalidated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "summary": "Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards\npredicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to\nvarious downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant\nperformance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale\nshift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain\ngeneralization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift\nwithin the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To\nthis end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift\ninfluence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this\ninfluence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the\ninfluence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd\nlocalization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we\nestablish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to\nquantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the\nlimitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity\nof scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our\nunderstanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.\nBuilding on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called\nCausal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the\ninfluence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive\nanalytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future\nresearch. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable\nresearch direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.",

        "summary": "Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex\nsemantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments\nfacing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing\napproaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing\nimagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their\ninteraction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To\naddress these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task\nframework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed\nclassification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net\nemploys dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed\nclassification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion\nmodule and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives\nthrough dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two\nheterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical\nmodels and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to\n75\\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\\% compared to\nstate-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed\nclassification accuracy up to 8\\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate\nenhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth\nbiases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling\ndepth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,\noffering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping.

        "summary": "Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity\nauthentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and\ne-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains\nchallenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the\nTemporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the\nGraph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both\nspatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances\nverification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node\ncaptures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using\nattention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method\nfurther employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which\nutilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and\nglobal spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal\ndependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn\ndynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments\nconducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR\nsurpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower\nEqual Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.",

        "summary": "Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is\nessential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous\naerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally\nintensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which\nresults in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To\naddress these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action\nrecognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low\ncomputational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone\nnetwork and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)\nstrategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network\n(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer\nefficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated\ninto the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model\ncomplexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to\ncombine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization\nduring training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct\nachieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while\nmaintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across\nall three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition\naccuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing\nrecognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes\nactions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable\nrecognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action\nrecognition.",

        "summary": "Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how\nto evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of\nstandardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation\nmetrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper\ncontributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of\ntheir sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,\nemphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing\nmetrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making\nflat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative\nsurface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled\nmethod to create composite metrics with better human alignment.

        "summary": "Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant\ndetection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar\nbackgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance\nhigh-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at\nthe single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose\na multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian\nalgorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate\nmissing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching\nand interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and\nprogressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.\nExperimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.",

        "summary": "As the volume of stored data continues to grow, identifying and protecting\nsensitive information within large repositories becomes increasingly\nchallenging, especially when shared with multiple users with different roles\nand permissions. This work presents a system architecture for trusted data\nsharing with policy-driven access control, enabling selective protection of\nsensitive regions while maintaining scalability. The proposed architecture\nintegrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive\nregions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions\nare secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for\nefficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system\nsupports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen\noverall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on\nvisual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically\ndetected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data\nrepository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO\ndetection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision\n(10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1\nsecond per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and\nscalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control.",

We explore\nthe challenges posed by intra-class variability, viewpoint differences and\ncompositional activity structures, which complicate mistake detection.\nAdditionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing datasets,\nevaluation metrics and state-of-the-art methods, categorizing approaches based\non their use of procedural structure, supervision levels and learning\nstrategies. Open challenges, such as distinguishing permissible variations from\ntrue mistakes and modeling error propagation are discussed alongside future\ndirections, including neuro-symbolic reasoning and counterfactual state\nmodeling.
