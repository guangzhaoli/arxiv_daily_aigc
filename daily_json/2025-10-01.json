        "summary": "Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,\nwhich limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In\nparticular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise\nmethods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating\nunnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address\nthis gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio\ngeneration, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level\nsegmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that\nenables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks\nalong with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained\nand visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and\nfurther research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,\na benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation\ninformation. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current\nstate-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,\nhigh-fidelity Foley synthesis.

        "summary": "Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements\nin diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly\nchallenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling\nmotion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and\ndomain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse\nscenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented\nframework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant\nreference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key\ntechnical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting\nhigh-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to\ndistill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach\nfor motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;\n(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates\ntransferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements\nacross multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible\ncomputational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design\nenables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the\nretrieval database without retraining any components.

Earlier methods improved spatial relationship\nfollowing with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to\nenhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.\nWe propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position\ncontrol into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via\nautomatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both\nspatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects\nwithin designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We\nfind that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate\nand cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully\ncomplete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for\nposition-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept\nof Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top\nmodels still have significant room for improvement in position-based\ngeneration. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances\nbase models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%\non PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on\nPosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while\nintegrating position control into leading models training-free.

We contend that in\ncurrent unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative\nreasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image\nreferring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is\nintrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we\nintroduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion\nmodel via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained\nimage conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the\ncomplex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while\nreserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve\nthis, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect\nthe VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to\nunleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a\nlarge, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.\nFinally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and\nperform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a\ncomprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source\ndatasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including\nimage generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and\nmulti-subject composition.

Existing TTS\napproaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and\nexternal reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to\nthe inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for\nNTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or\nauxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in\nvisual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)\nProfile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic\nand conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to\nadaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule\nguidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength.

Earlier works finetune\ndiffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited\nand difficult to scale up.

In this\nwork, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel\nre-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data\nor editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,\nIMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify\nmisalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion\nconditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)\nformulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively\nUpdated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing\nalignment methods.

They either rely on\ncomputationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and\nzero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion\nmodels, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual\nAuto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and\nstrong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation\nfor resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a\npioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation\ncapabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection\nstrategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its\nlow-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.\nWe employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which\nis injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.\nConcurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are\nintegrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity\ntexture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is\nthe first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both\nquantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating\nthat EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to\nstate-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling\nlatency.

        "summary": "Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though\nimage-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation\ngeneration is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for\nvector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a\nDifferentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the\nframe-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable\npolynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation\nacross multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and\ntemporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a\nBernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus\nachieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce\nsparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency\nand supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods.\nCross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the\nrobustness and compatibility of our approach.",

        "summary": "Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically\nrelies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that\nnecessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such\nas self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,\ntheir application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)\nremains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel\nframework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception\ncapabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle\nof self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates\npseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs\nto establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then\nformulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution\nthrough group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging\nits own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual\ncapability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's\nzero-shot performance by 31.8\\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.\nRemarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves\nperformance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art\nsupervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA\nbenchmarks.",

        "summary": "Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic\nmanipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity\npreservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective\nfor intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid\ngeometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks\ndeviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,\ninaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,\na landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,\nidentity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark\ntokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial\ntokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a\nlocation-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens\nfor unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance\ninteractions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a\nlandmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target\nlandmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured\nchain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To\nmitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest\nbenchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained\ninstructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency.

        "summary": "Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)\nhas gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,\ncommon-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively\napplying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We\nargue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are\nasked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not\nreally see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for\nsemantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,\nleaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable\nperceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited\nvisual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically\nuses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,\nheterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful\nvisual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting\nin catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue\ncapabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before\nreasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive\nartifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that\nsubsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose\nForensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for\nmulti-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose\nExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's\nexplainability for image forensics from five key aspects.

Prior methods for\nclothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which\noverlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit\nfunctions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real\nscenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body\ncorrespondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to\nrecover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions\nalso align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed\ngeometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing\nand interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to\nfurther enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic\nscans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by\n18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for\nSMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on\na wide range of datasets.

Although gradient-based\nsolvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack\ntheoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,\nwe introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of\nDMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional\nentropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into\nthe inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its\nnoise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a\nreference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based\non these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for\nthe generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces\nuncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive\nexperiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ngradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff\nreduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\\% (FID improves from 5.10 to\n2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\\%\n(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves\ntext-to-image generation while reducing artifacts.

        "summary": "Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as\nmathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research\nhas sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding\npromising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study\nuncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially\nenhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,\nit may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures\non otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute\nthis phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the\nmodel to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose\nVision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that\nexplicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.\nOur result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's\nreliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a\nwide range of established benchmarks.

        "summary": "Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize\ntraining data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior\nwork has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the\nfundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this\npaper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space\ndynamics to address the question: \"How do diffusion models memorize?\" We show\nthat memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during\nearly denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and\naccelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)\nmemorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is\nlarger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying\npredictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training\nimages into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and\nsteering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of\nintermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and\nreplaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising\nschedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,\nthese results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism\nof memorization in diffusion models.",

        "summary": "We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to\nregions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes\nto scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially\nvarying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,\npreferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting\n(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their\nuniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to\nhigh-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at\ntheir original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization\nmethods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require\ndense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between\nthe prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user\nneeds for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized\nhigh-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a\nlow-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable\nnetwork that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a\nuser-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution\nobservations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy\nof uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages\nhigh-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a\nfeed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from\nthe initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided\ndensification mechanism that effectively captures details under large\nresolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance\nin local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to\n$1024\\times1024$ resolution.",

        "summary": "Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning\ncapabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily\ndependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual\nconstruction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and\nconsequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this\nchallenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM\nself-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary\nimage pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)\nStrategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in \"Who Is the\nSpy\"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions\nacross multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously\ngenerate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from\nArbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate\ngames from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability\nacross diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We\ndemonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:\nCLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable\nPerformance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization\n(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play\nand reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the\nperformance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving\nsustained long-term improvements.

        "title": "Learning to See Before Seeing: Demystifying LLM Visual Priors from Language Pre-training",
        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,\nsurprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual\ncapabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of\nmultimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having\nseen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the\nimplicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language\npre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with\nunique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual\nreasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on\nreasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.\nThis reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and\nuniversally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior\nemerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more\nsensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In\nparallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its\nperformance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a\ndata-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T\ntoken scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled\nexperiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction\npipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal\nfine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and\nmixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we\npropose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level\nExistence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of\ndeliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the\nway for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.",

Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in\npanoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),\nwhich leads to suboptimal efficiency.

        "title": "DiffCamera: Arbitrary Refocusing on Images",
        "summary": "The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing\nblur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once\nthe image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is\nundesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose\nDiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image\nconditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we\ndesign a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the\ntraining requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in\nthe same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we\ndevelop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with\nvarying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that\ntraining with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF\nbehaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger\nconstraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos\nof different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we\npropose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF\nmanipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically\ngrounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully\naligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be\ncombined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to\nevaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of\nscenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography\nand generative AI applications.",

        "summary": "Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning\ncapabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models\nto translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to\nproduce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that\nreasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often\nfail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical\nvisual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning\n(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through\ninteraction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training\nreveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we\ncreate pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to\nsolve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4\npoints over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning\nbenchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%\nif those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit\nsupervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be\neffectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit\nannotations.",

Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured\nevaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four\ndisentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.\nTogether, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in\nindustry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts\naligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for\nprompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation\nof each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+\nmodels and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our\nanalysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current\nmodels exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related\ncontrols. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a\nvision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing\nzero-shot baselines.

        "summary": "Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is indispensable for characterizing the\nmicrostructure of thin films during perovskite solar cell fabrication. Accurate\nidentification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are\ncritical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization\npathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains\ngoverns carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis\nis still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present\nan automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that\nenables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and\ndefect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x\narchitecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i)\nAdaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and\nfine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing;\nand (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves\nfine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary\nrecognition. Trained on an augmented dataset of 10,994 SEM images, PerovSegNet\nachieves a mean Average Precision of 87.25% with 265.4 Giga Floating Point\nOperations, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8x-seg by 4.08%, while reducing\nmodel size and computational load by 24.43% and 25.22%, respectively. Beyond\nsegmentation, the framework provides quantitative grain-level metrics, such as\nlead iodide/perovskite area and count, which can serve as reliable indicators\nof crystallization efficiency and microstructural quality.

Prompt identification of gastrointestinal disorders greatly\ncontributes to arresting the progression of the illness and improving\ntherapeutic outcomes. This paper presents an ensemble of pre-trained vision\ntransformers (ViTs) for accurately classifying endoscopic images of the GI\ntract to categorize gastrointestinal problems and illnesses. ViTs,\nattention-based neural networks, have revolutionized image recognition by\nleveraging the transformative power of the transformer architecture, achieving\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various visual tasks. The proposed\nmodel was evaluated on the publicly available HyperKvasir dataset with 10,662\nimages of 23 different GI diseases for the purpose of identifying GI tract\ndiseases. An ensemble method is proposed utilizing the predictions of two\npre-trained models, MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200, which achieved\naccuracies of 90.57% and 90.48%, respectively. All the individual models are\noutperformed by the ensemble model, GastroViT, with an average precision,\nrecall, F1 score, and accuracy of 69%, 63%, 64%, and 91.98%, respectively, in\nthe first testing that involves 23 classes.

Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that\nare commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest\nthreat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in\ntime to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence\ncan leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output\ngrowth by forecasting sickness.

More importantly,\nZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while\nreducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG.

We present the \\textbf{Automated Vehicle\nInspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \\emph{multi-view} perception system\nthat couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver\n\\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras\ncapture a full 360{\\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then\nrouted to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for\nICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for\nscratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,\nwhile a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the\nexpected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \\(\\approx\\!\n300\\,\\text{ms}\\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)\nvehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI\nachieves \\textbf{ 93 \\%} verification accuracy, \\textbf{86 \\%} defect-detection\nrecall, and sustains \\(\\mathbf{3.3}\\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or\nno segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first\npublicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with\ndefect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment\nchallenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit\noutlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision\nperformance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in\n4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,\nleading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only\noutliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this\nend, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression\n(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max\nquantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero\nsuppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach\nreduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing\noutlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and\nempirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse\nactivation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on\nFLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.",

        "summary": "Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the\ncomplex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically\nrely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to\nnew scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and\nlimited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,\nautomatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or\nhuman involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based\non MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key\ncapabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven\nheuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving\nchain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG\nmechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly\ndetection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided\nheuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA\nemploys a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware\ntools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a\nchain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for\ncontinual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA\nachieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex\nscenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its\ngeneralizable and robust anomaly detection capability.

        "summary": "Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI\napplications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and\nchallenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level\nsemantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess\nthe deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual\nand textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a\nreasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents\nthe following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond\nshallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,\nand causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural\nimages, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across\ncontent types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple\nimages and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting\nreal-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived\neither from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of\npublic datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,\ncurrent state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,\nthe leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but\nonly 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the\nincreased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further\nadvances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval.

Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which\nrequire no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet\naccurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present\nSQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal\nLarge Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR.

        "summary": "We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video\nsuper-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence\ninto separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit\nframe warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,\nspatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation\noffers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at\narbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture\nfine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the\npossibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the\nsampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The\ncoefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with\na neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on\nthe low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our\njoint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal\nsuper-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:\nacross a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally\nmore consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being\ncomputationally more efficient.

Flower operates through an iterative procedure over\nthree steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity\nnetwork predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the\nestimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and\n(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along\nthe flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how\nFlower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives\nfrom plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical\nside, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using\nnearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.",

        "summary": "Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head\nmotions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation\nmethods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming,\nrequires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators.\nMost existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized\nanimation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also\noverlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the\nsame audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel\nmethod for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces\ndiverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for\nediting via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a\nfully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level\ndiversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style\npersonalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise\ncontrol and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we\ndemonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse\nholistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between\nhigh fidelity and diversity.

        "summary": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters\nunlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key\nchallenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.\nExisting approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to\nexploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits\nrepresentation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled\ncategories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world\nscenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual\nExperts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates\nmulti-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of\ntwo modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which\nalternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to\njointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)\nMulti-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the\nsingle-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different\ngranularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective\ncross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the\nnumber of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical\nopen-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual\nrecognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,\nparticularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of\ncategory numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing\nthe exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\\%.

        "summary": "Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes\ncompact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale\ncounterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage\nburdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on\ndense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult\nto scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse\nrepresentation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of\nrepresenting all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative\ninformation in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian\nprimitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under\nthe same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting\ndistillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt\nCUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling\nhigh-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our\nmethod is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation\npipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,\nwhile remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost.

However, their capacity to comprehend\nhuman-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of\ncomprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the\nhuman-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.\nSuch high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the\nphysical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular\nstructures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed\nto provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene\nunderstanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three\nkey features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains\nwith 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.\n2.

        "summary": "Liver fibrosis represents the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix\ncaused by sustained hepatic injury. It disrupts normal lobular architecture and\nfunction, increasing the chances of cirrhosis and liver failure. Precise\nstaging of fibrosis for early diagnosis and intervention is often invasive,\nwhich carries risks and complications. To address this challenge, recent\nadvances in artificial intelligence-based liver segmentation and fibrosis\nstaging offer a non-invasive alternative. As a result, the CARE 2025 Challenge\naimed for automated methods to quantify and analyse liver fibrosis in\nreal-world scenarios, using multi-centre, multi-modal, and multi-phase MRI\ndata. This challenge included tasks of precise liver segmentation (LiSeg) and\nfibrosis staging (LiFS). In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for\nboth tasks across all the provided MRI modalities. This pipeline integrates\npseudo-labelling based on multi-modal co-registration, liver segmentation using\ndeep neural networks, and liver fibrosis staging based on shape, textural,\nappearance, and directional (STAD) features derived from segmentation masks and\nMRI images. By solely using the released data with limited annotations, our\nproposed pipeline demonstrated excellent generalisability for all MRI\nmodalities, achieving top-tier performance across all competition subtasks.\nThis approach provides a rapid and reproducible framework for quantitative\nMRI-based liver fibrosis assessment, supporting early diagnosis and clinical\ndecision-making.

        "summary": "The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the\nbarrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images\nand manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false\nnarratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation\n(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is\nrestricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and\ncaption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as\nmismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world\nforgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that\nintroduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text\nmanipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we\ngenerate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed\ninto absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students\non the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,\ntext attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:\nFG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three\nvisible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and\nrealistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension\ncomplements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors\non both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen\nevaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with\nFG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at\nhttps://github.com/Gaganx0/DGM4plus",

We diagnose this limitation as a combination of\nlabel-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground\nalignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight\nsegmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation\nmasks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a\njoint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These\nscores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,\ngrounding, and token-level explanations.

        "summary": "Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video\nsuper-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most\nexisting methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention\ncomputation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make\nthe first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.\nThis is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native\nfor patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an\ninnovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter\nfor conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches\nto maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features\nfrom the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete\nsemantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location\ninformation into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the\nglobal video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize\nhigh-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made\nmulti-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across\nindividually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based\nparadigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512\nresolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.",

        "summary": "Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like\nOpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is\nessential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum\nof tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences\nin data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy\nhighly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this\nend, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM\ndata to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.\nSpecifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using\nmulti-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal\nspatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also\nintroduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient\npretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and\nmultimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from\ncommon RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more\ncomprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive\nexperiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the\nperformance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream\ntasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These\nresults underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level\ngeospatial artificial intelligence.

        "summary": "Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image\ngiven a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet\nannotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)\nunion-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,\ncarrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended\nmodification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the\nability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we\npropose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval\nstage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the\noverlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby\nfiltering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a\ncleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we\nadapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary\nsemantic relevance judgments (\"Yes/No\"), which goes beyond CLIP's global\nfeature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level\nconsistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse\nretrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures\nprecise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,\nFashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,\nimproving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points.

Our key insight is to\nexploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery\n(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint\noptimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing\narbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics\nand extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each\nheterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module\ntermed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse\ndistortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping\nregions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into\na novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres\ndynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,\nfused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art\nperformance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth\nnetworks.

Current VICL methods, such\nas Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption\nthat images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context\nexamples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient\njustification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.\nFurthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of\nrandomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random\nsampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of\ncomparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To\naddress these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of\nPartial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context\nexamples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a\njackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable\nalternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure\ncomprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences.

We hypothesize that this happens when the\ndiffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it\nlearned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a\ncorrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint\nprompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.\nThe goal is to steer towards \"pure\" joint modes where all concepts can coexist\nwith balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept\nguidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;\nwe characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our\napproach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements\nstandard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts\nindicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer\ndropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior\ncompositional methods.

        "summary": "Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as\nindependent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD\nresearch branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to\nfragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,\nreconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding\npaths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in\ndistorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm\nrates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework\nfor multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables\nadaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This\nprocess is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,\nmulti-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,\ngeneral-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module\nto suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid\nshortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed\ninto modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,\nwhich dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To\nfurther improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and\na MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\\% while maintaining\nsparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,\nand 66 classes.\n  The source code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/yuanzhao-CVLAB/UniMMAD.",

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but\nfalter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This\nfailure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical\ncoordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this\npaper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation\nby reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation\nproblem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a\nplug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a\nHybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to\ngenerate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A\ntoken-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about\nand ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that\nVLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of\nbenchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region\ngenerational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our\ntwo-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved\nwithout compromising the base model's general visual understanding\ncapabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for\nbuilding perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning\nand fine-grained visual grounding.",

To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition\nand study of MMT dialogue safety.

This study\nintroduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised\npoint clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing\ncomplete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness\nunder low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light\nimage enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires\ninitial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by\nautomatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and\ncameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining\nthe setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure\nuniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a\nVelodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration.

Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual\nprompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into\nprocessing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this\nlimitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive\nAnomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is\ncompatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual\nprompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our\nexperiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to\nprior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines\nhow backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity\nrobustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring\nfoundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that\na well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light\ndeployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.",

To evaluate such capabilities of\ncurrent state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first\nbenchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal\nlogical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35\natomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths\nranging from 2 to 9.

        "summary": "Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been\nprimarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in\ndomain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain\nunderexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition\nbenchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo\nrecognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of\nthousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed\nmethod, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with\nsupervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate\nlogo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match\nproduct images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand\nlabels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing\nbrand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which\nresults in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,\nLogo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:\nLogo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual\nGrounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental\nresults show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in\nOOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.",

Building on these advancements, diffusion\nmodels have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image\nediting. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the\nsource image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.\nHowever, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the\ntarget text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while\nenabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility\nneeded for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map\nInversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for\noptimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We\nanalyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this\nanalysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with\nthe desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and\nedited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion\noutperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in\nboth preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts.

To\naddress this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human\nfeedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,\nhowever, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a\nlearned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality\nhuman annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we\nintroduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables\n\"free-lunch\" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for\npaired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched\nprompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original\ncaptions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible\nwith existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our\nsetting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations\nacross multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their\noriginal counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved\ntext-to-image alignment.

        "title": "Dragging with Geometry: From Pixels to Geometry-Guided Image Editing",
        "summary": "Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,\nenabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most\ndrag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of\n3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,\nparticularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective\ntransformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\ngeometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses\nthree key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level\nediting, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)\nresolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified\ndisplacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,\nGeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a\nsingle forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is\nintroduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and\nensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,\nstructural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability.

While\nrecovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most\nexisting approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic\nmethods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to\nmodel the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between\naccuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive\nwith state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D\nobservations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which\ngenerates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations\nunconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.\nOur model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the\ntransformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the\ntime-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small\nMLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the\nlatent vector.

However, existing methods rely on\noversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via\nbasic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the\ncomplex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and\nhallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework\nto incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO\nvia the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in\nCLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse\nautoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative\nsamples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation\nfrom the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative\nsupervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce\nobjective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training\nefficiency.

However, when applied to long-tailed\ndistributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing\nminority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class\nproportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted\nFlow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under\nclass-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class\nlabel information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using\nmini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias\nthrough a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a\nlabel-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target\ndistribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority\nbased on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.\nBy incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically\nrecovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and\nempirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k\n> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed\nbenchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.",

        "summary": "Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for\nunlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental\nmonitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies\nin remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking\nobject-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization\nand transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in\nremote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel\ntask of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To\nsupport this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25\ncategories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object\nattributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce\nDE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed\nto systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also\npresent DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture\nexplicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal\nstrategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing\nvision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote\nsensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth\nmodel consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,\ndemonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical\nsoundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding\nenvironmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution\nremote sensing scenarios.

        "summary": "Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval\nmodels (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of\nfused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To\naddress this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently\nexplored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys\nacross diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing\nnew composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and\ntext given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation\nto ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality\ncombinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized\nContrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal\nretrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.\nSpecifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all\nmodalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired\ndatasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on\noff-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)\nusing the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.",

        "summary": "Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with\ntimely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to\nspecialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise\nfor medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered\nby the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating\ngenerative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark\ncomprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common\nophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,\nanatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting\nanatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and\ndemographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary\nLMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion\nwith substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task\ncoverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity\nclassification with international grading standards, and demographic\nprediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our\nevaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved\n~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance\nremained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging.

        "summary": "Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet\nexisting models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge\nsources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This\nfragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts\nseamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,\nexemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through\nreal-time interaction. We present $\\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation\nframework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating\nthree knowledge paradigms: (i) $\\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from\nannotated datasets, (ii) $\\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot\nreference examples, and (iii) $\\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs\nlike clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge\nsources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts\ndefining $\\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating\n$\\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching\nbetween paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural\nmodifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse\nmodalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that\nK-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and\ninteractive segmentation settings.

        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide\nrange of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows\nthat selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal\nperformance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique\nremains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is\nbeneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and\nlearning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping\nenhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these\nobservations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations\nthrough the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as\npredicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular\nlayer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding\nfor multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that\nskipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and\nalso show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model\ndegradation.",

        "summary": "Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small\nrisk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving\nsurvival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor\noutcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal\nnevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians\nwithout specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low\nresolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of\nsegmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise\nsegmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust\ndiagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated\neffectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of\nannotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though\naccurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical\napplications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines\nmathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,\nleveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,\nreduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant\nperformance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves\na Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,\noutperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,\nrespectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external\ndatasets.

        "title": "VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models",
        "summary": "As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical\napplications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has\nbecome increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face\nsignificant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden\nby user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires\ninvasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with\nAPI-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that\ntransfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,\nwe introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection\n(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.\nWe demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of\nVLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual\ninputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for\nruntime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when\nan underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be\nsteered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based\ninterventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on\nopen-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment\ndirections: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific\nsteering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity\nclosely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative\nsteering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving\ndirectional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and\nclosed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%\nperformance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.",

LLM-RG processes an image and a\nfree-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types\nand attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors\nwith a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into\nnatural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought\nreasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car\nbenchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based\nbaselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further\nimproves grounding.

Unfortunately, malicious actors\nhave started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks\nduring video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the\ndeepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.\nUsing this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video\nenables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of\ngaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is\ninstead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect\ndeepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal\ncommunication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method\nadapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric\ninformation.

        "summary": "Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks\nthrough text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,\nstate-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from\n2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human\naccuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they\nrequire task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to\nask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?\nWe take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show\nthat the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that\ntext-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to\nunlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex\nregression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually\nin pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through\nvisual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller\nmodels, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over\n2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.\nInterestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with\nDepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at\nboundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also\nenables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code\nand model will be released at the link below.",

        "summary": "Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing\npaired studies from different time points and answering questions about\nclinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the\nconsistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute\nsingle-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest\nX-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The\nmodel first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce\nnuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:\nstep 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates\nkeyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;\nstep 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the\nfinal answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that\nmatter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent\nattention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains\ncompetitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing\nintrinsic interpretability.

To address this, we propose a learned framework that\nedits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity.

        "summary": "Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps\nusing RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision\ntasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often\nassume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking\ncalibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This\nwork systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world\nlightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion\nframework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three\nkey aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic\ndatasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.\nSecond, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to\nidentify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading\npropagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network\ntailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained\nmonocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging\nregions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy\nsignificantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.\nOn the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our\nmodel improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer\ndataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method\nsurpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its\npotential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.\nQualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the\neffectiveness and generalizability of our approach.",

Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the\nsame movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to\ngenerate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in\nprogress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in\nour problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan\nis a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while\noptimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches\nand reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The\nembedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible\nfloorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs\nfar apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this\nembedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making\nit possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across\nextensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans\nfrom trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and\nguided-diffusion methods.",

While PTQ is more\ncost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible\nto accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).\nAffine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy\nbetween the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by\nits full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine\ntransformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,\nworsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based\nAffine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs\ncluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT\nrefines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,\nwithout requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We\nfurther introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on\nImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods\nacross diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1\naccuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18.

        "summary": "Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present\nsymmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical\nexample is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A\ncommon way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data\naugmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable\nalgorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the\nnotion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of\nsimple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities\nbetween orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used\ncan be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this\nmethodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,\nrotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a\n$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the\nconstant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is\ninteresting in its own right.

To\naddress this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning\n(\\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that\njointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both\nthe entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language\nmodels (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify\nmulti-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as\nslide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an\nentity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level\nfeatures, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific\nattributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity\nrepresentations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module\nthat can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations\nwithin and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into\na slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for\nslide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level\noutputs to produce the final prediction results.

Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models\noften fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently\nenhances small model accuracy.

        "summary": "Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with\nwide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,\nsuch as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is\nparticularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and\ncomplex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene\nGraphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates\non structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting\nimages into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for\ninference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.\nThis approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object\nand relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model\ntraining without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve\n81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI\nevaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy.

        "summary": "Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,\nparticularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models\nutilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence\nof ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,\ncross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the\nissue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur\nhigh computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially\nin the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D\npseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and\nMetric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D\npseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields\nsubstantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\\%, from 9.73\nto 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to\nearlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to\nother architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,\nachieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,\navoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our\nmethod enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on\nthe full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71\nmIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\\%. These findings highlight\nthe critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice\nof loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene\nunderstanding.",

Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output\nscalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,\nuser-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and\ninterpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their\ninterdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while\nscoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we\npropose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.\nAgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,\ndistortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a\nplanner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific\nstrategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and\nthe summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with\nhuman-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce\nAgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and\nAgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and\nsummarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents.

However,\nexisting methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that\nrequire extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and\nlimiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.\nTo address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency\nLearning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns\ngenerated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual\nprompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the\ninvariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by\nspatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions\nto enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps\ntoward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance\ninter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces\na region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These\naligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention\nmaps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates\naccurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods by 10\\% in lexical accuracy and 25\\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)\nachieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing\ncurrent leading visual foundation models by 8\\% in zero-shot visual grounding.",

Models were evaluated\nunder six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of\ngeometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and\nImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both\ndata volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success\nrate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size\nreduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained\non curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger\nbut less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives\nrobustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across\nstructural variations but not across color distributions.

        "summary": "Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural\ncomputer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and\ncomplex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based\nGraph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under\nextreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of\nsmall dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic\nsimilarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized\nweight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA\nestablishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only\n4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating\nthis graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a\ncomplementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and\nglobal dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and\nparameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod\ndataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across\nmultiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive\nperformance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%\nimprovement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure\ncompared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and\nvisualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's\neffectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated\npractical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving\naccurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10\nto 120 pods under challenging field conditions.",

        "summary": "Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images\ndespite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods\nfocus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the\ndynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during\ntraining. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a\nunified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination\nby jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during\ntraining, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing\nmodule that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors\nbefore bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training\nwe reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and\ncurrent visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving\nembedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place\nneighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively\nexpand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a\nfrozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA\nacross eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on\nSPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively.

To address this issue, we propose Lexical Tone-Aware\nLip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S). To tackle viseme-to-phoneme complexity, our model\nadapts an English pre-trained audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) model\nvia a cross-lingual transfer learning strategy. This strategy not only\ntransfers universal knowledge learned from extensive English data to the\nMandarin domain but also circumvents the prohibitive cost of training such a\nmodel from scratch. To specifically model lexical tones and enhance\nintelligibility, we further employ a flow-matching model to generate the F0\ncontour. This generation process is guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units,\nwhich contain crucial suprasegmental information. The overall speech quality is\nthen elevated through a two-stage training paradigm, where a flow-matching\npostnet refines the coarse spectrogram from the first stage. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods\nin both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy.",

        "summary": "The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for\napplying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning\nmethods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled\nexamples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot\nlearning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical\napplications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require\nlearning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously\nknown ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot\nclassification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been\nscarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a\nlarge-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public\ndatabases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for\nstandard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating\nmulti-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a\nstandard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide\nrange of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate\nthat increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training\nexamples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer\nlearning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not\nbeing tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution\nimages improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient\nmodel architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with\nsignificantly reduced resource requirements.",

This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for\nPan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,\nRADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning\nRadiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a\nnovel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that\ncan better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to\nimprove uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the\nproposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more\neffectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we\nfuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level\nto improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed\napproach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results\ndemonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps\nand robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification\napproaches.",

        "summary": "Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,\nwith patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon\nmodeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch\nconstruction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture\ntemporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This\nnaive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens\nrepresentation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided\nDynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically\ndetects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch\nboundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational\nbenefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an\nEntropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria\nto locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an\nAdaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to\ncapture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.\nThese embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model\ninter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks\ndemonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing\nentropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series\nmodeling.

        "summary": "Diabetic retinopathy grading is inherently ordinal and long-tailed, with\nminority stages being scarce, heterogeneous, and clinically critical to detect\naccurately. Conventional methods often rely on isotropic Gaussian priors and\nsymmetric loss functions, misaligning latent representations with the task's\nasymmetric nature. We propose the Constrained Asymmetric Prior Wasserstein\nAutoencoder (CAP-WAE), a novel framework that addresses these challenges\nthrough three key innovations. Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder\n(WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving\nthe heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes. The latent space is\nfurther structured by a Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness (MAOC) loss\nto ensure grade-ordered separability. At the supervision level, we introduce a\ndirection-aware ordinal loss, where a lightweight head predicts asymmetric\ndispersions to generate soft labels that reflect clinical priorities by\npenalizing under-grading more severely. Stabilized by an adaptive multi-task\nweighting scheme, our end-to-end model requires minimal tuning. Across public\nDR benchmarks, CAP-WAE consistently achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic\nWeighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, surpassing both ordinal classification\nand latent generative baselines. t-SNE visualizations further reveal that our\nmethod reshapes the latent manifold into compact, grade-ordered clusters with\nreduced overlap.",

Prior work often addresses\nthis by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is\nprohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods\nonly predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust\nother model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging\n(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using\nweight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing\ncomputational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that\nenhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with\nfunctional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic\nbase model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.\nSecond, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging\ncoefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal\ncomponent subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected\nproximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5\nmodels, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%\nwhile being up to 60x more efficient.",

        "summary": "Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric\nimages enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial\nsafety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently\nhindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on\ncostly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object\ninteraction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of\nthe actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about\nmanipulated objects (e.g., \"I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to\nthe pan\"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to\nacquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We\nintroduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel\ntask where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from\nnatural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference\ntime. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised\nIn-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model\ndistilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object\nassociations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at\ntest time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on\nopen-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the\nsuperiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that\nWISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of\nfully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise\nannotations.",

In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)\nbenchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied\nreasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding.

        "summary": "Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging\ntask due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like\nConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more\nfundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To\naddress this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),\na novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical\npriors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that\nprocesses all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS\ndataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range\nforecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including\nSOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this\nclass of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal\nfusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.",

While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,\nacademic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these\nchallenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this\npaper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with\negocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories\nthrough a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.\nWe leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose\nannotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.\nThis makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at\nnight or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems\ndeveloped by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify\ncomponents that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with\ndifferent levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less\nmature approaches.

With progressively improving\ncapabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,\ncurrent embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,\nexisting LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed\nplanning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In\nthis work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,\nstate-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied\ntask planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to\nexplicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic\nrevision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning\nstrategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action\nSubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan\nbased on the current environment state.

        "summary": "Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from\npoint annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a\npromising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,\nwe discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient\nutilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present\nPoint2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment\n(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent\nmanner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label\nassignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an\nenhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes\nthe shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and\nSAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the\nfirst model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it\ncreatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed\nalgorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense\nscenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios\nwith large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:\n66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on\nDOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.",

To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that\nintegrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both\nthe Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based\nmethods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness\nof the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic\ndiffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean\nStructural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For\nSAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)\nis used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model\nto study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each\nchannel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative\nmetrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair\ncomparison across grayscale and color images.

        "summary": "Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare\nmonitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon\nwelfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for\ndetermining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object\ndetectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare\nindicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for\nreal-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In\naddition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon\nscenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object\nmotion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework\nthat uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and\ntheir corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,\nthrough specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon\nscenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to\ncalculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two\nsalmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID\nswitches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art\npedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.\nAdditionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,\ndemonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated\nwelfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis.

Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive\ncapabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions\ngrounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set\nof fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,\nrotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively\nstructured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most\ndemanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37\nstate-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal\nsystematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,\nand inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling\nanalysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human\nsubjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\\%), task difficulty as measured by human\nresponse time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that\nSpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.\nWe believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs\nand highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space.

        "summary": "Developing autonomous agents that effectively interact with Graphic User\nInterfaces (GUIs) remains a challenging open problem, especially for small\non-device models. In this paper, we present Ferret-UI Lite, a compact,\nend-to-end GUI agent that operates across diverse platforms, including mobile,\nweb, and desktop. Utilizing techniques optimized for developing small models,\nwe build our 3B Ferret-UI Lite agent through curating a diverse GUI data\nmixture from real and synthetic sources, strengthening inference-time\nperformance through chain-of-thought reasoning and visual tool-use, and\nreinforcement learning with designed rewards. Ferret-UI Lite achieves\ncompetitive performance with other small-scale GUI agents. In GUI grounding,\nFerret-UI Lite attains scores of $91.6\\%$, $53.3\\%$, and $61.2\\%$ on the\nScreenSpot-V2, ScreenSpot-Pro, and OSWorld-G benchmarks, respectively. For GUI\nnavigation, Ferret-UI Lite achieves success rates of $28.0\\%$ on AndroidWorld\nand $19.8\\%$ on OSWorld. We share our methods and lessons learned from\ndeveloping compact, on-device GUI agents.",

        "title": "Beyond Overall Accuracy: Pose- and Occlusion-driven Fairness Analysis in Pedestrian Detection for Autonomous Driving",
        "summary": "Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where\nensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim\nto reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range\nrecognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.\nIn this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian\npose--including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation--as well as\nindividual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five\npedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)\nalongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity\nPersons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal\nOpportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To\nassess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our\nfindings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight\nelbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative\nimpact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN\nachieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all\nattributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-\nand occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.",
