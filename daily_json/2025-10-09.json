        "title": "Addressing the ID-Matching Challenge in Long Video Captioning",
        "summary": "Generating captions for long and complex videos is both critical and\nchallenging, with significant implications for the growing fields of\ntext-to-video generation and multi-modal understanding. One key challenge in\nlong video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear\nin different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior\nworks have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer\nfrom limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits\ntheir overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we\nbuild upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the\ninherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the\nID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new\nbenchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using\nthis benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights\nthat the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)\nenhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of\ninformation of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a\nnovel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning\nEffectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption\nquality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our\napproach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision\nof ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%\nto 80% compared to baseline. RICE makes it possible to continuously track\ndifferent individuals in the captions of long videos.",

        "summary": "Speech-driven talking face synthesis (TFS) focuses on generating lifelike\nfacial animations from audio input. Current TFS models perform well in English\nbut unsatisfactorily in non-English languages, producing wrong mouth shapes and\nrigid facial expressions. The terrible performance is caused by the\nEnglish-dominated training datasets and the lack of cross-language\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we propose Multilingual Experts (MuEx), a novel\nframework featuring a Phoneme-Guided Mixture-of-Experts (PG-MoE) architecture\nthat employs phonemes and visemes as universal intermediaries to bridge audio\nand video modalities, achieving lifelike multilingual TFS. To alleviate the\ninfluence of linguistic differences and dataset bias, we extract audio and\nvideo features as phonemes and visemes respectively, which are the basic units\nof speech sounds and mouth movements. To address audiovisual synchronization\nissues, we introduce the Phoneme-Viseme Alignment Mechanism (PV-Align), which\nestablishes robust cross-modal correspondences between phonemes and visemes. In\naddition, we build a Multilingual Talking Face Benchmark (MTFB) comprising 12\ndiverse languages with 95.04 hours of high-quality videos for training and\nevaluating multilingual TFS performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nMuEx achieves superior performance across all languages in MTFB and exhibits\neffective zero-shot generalization to unseen languages without additional\ntraining.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models have recently advanced human motion generation, producing\nrealistic and diverse animations from textual prompts. However, adapting these\nmodels to unseen actions or styles typically requires additional motion capture\ndata and full retraining, which is costly and difficult to scale. We propose a\npost-training framework based on Reinforcement Learning that fine-tunes\npretrained motion diffusion models using only textual prompts, without\nrequiring any motion ground truth. Our approach employs a pretrained\ntext-motion retrieval network as a reward signal and optimizes the diffusion\npolicy with Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization, effectively shifting the\nmodel's generative distribution toward the target domain without relying on\npaired motion data. We evaluate our method on cross-dataset adaptation and\nleave-one-out motion experiments using the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets across\nboth latent- and joint-space diffusion architectures. Results from quantitative\nmetrics and user studies show that our approach consistently improves the\nquality and diversity of generated motions, while preserving performance on the\noriginal distribution.

        "summary": "Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for visual content\ncreation, but often overlook the intrinsic structural properties of visual\ndata. Our prior work, IAR, initiated a direction to address this by\nreorganizing the visual codebook based on embedding similarity, thereby\nimproving generation robustness. However, it is constrained by the rigidity of\npre-trained codebooks and the inaccuracies of hard, uniform clustering. To\novercome these limitations, we propose IAR2, an advanced autoregressive\nframework that enables a hierarchical semantic-detail synthesis process. At the\ncore of IAR2 is a novel Semantic-Detail Associated Dual Codebook, which\ndecouples image representations into a semantic codebook for global semantic\ninformation and a detail codebook for fine-grained refinements. It expands the\nquantization capacity from a linear to a polynomial scale, significantly\nenhancing expressiveness. To accommodate this dual representation, we propose a\nSemantic-Detail Autoregressive Prediction scheme coupled with a Local-Context\nEnhanced Autoregressive Head, which performs hierarchical prediction-first the\nsemantic token, then the detail token-while leveraging a local context window\nto enhance spatial coherence. Furthermore, for conditional generation, we\nintroduce a Progressive Attention-Guided Adaptive CFG mechanism that\ndynamically modulates the guidance scale for each token based on its relevance\nto the condition and its temporal position in the generation sequence,\nimproving conditional alignment without sacrificing realism. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that IAR2 sets a new state-of-the-art for\nautoregressive image generation, achieving a FID of 1.50 on ImageNet. Our model\nnot only surpasses previous methods in performance but also demonstrates\nsuperior computational efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness of our\nstructured, coarse-to-fine generation strategy.",

In this paper, we propose SaFeR-VLM, a\nsafety-aligned reinforcement learning framework that embeds safety directly\ninto multimodal reasoning. The framework integrates four components: (I)\nQI-Safe-10K, a curated dataset emphasizing safety-critical and\nreasoning-sensitive cases; (II) safety-aware rollout, where unsafe generations\nundergo reflection and correction instead of being discarded; (III) structured\nreward modeling with multi-dimensional weighted criteria and explicit penalties\nfor hallucinations and contradictions; and (IV) GRPO optimization, which\nreinforces both safe and corrected trajectories. This unified design shifts\nsafety from a passive safeguard to an active driver of reasoning, enabling\nscalable and generalizable safety-aware reasoning. SaFeR-VLM further\ndemonstrates robustness against both explicit and implicit risks, supporting\ndynamic and interpretable safety decisions beyond surface-level filtering.\nSaFeR-VLM-3B achieves average performance $70.13$ and $78.97$ on safety and\nhelpfulness across six benchmarks, surpassing both same-scale and $>10\\times$\nlarger models such as Skywork-R1V3-38B, Qwen2.5VL-72B, and GLM4.5V-106B.\nRemarkably, SaFeR-VLM-7B benefits from its increased scale to surpass\nGPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash by \\num{6.47} and \\num{16.76} points\nrespectively on safety metrics, achieving this improvement without any\ndegradation in helpfulness performance.

        "summary": "Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the object\nreferred to by the query sentence in the video. Most existing methods require\nend-to-end training with dense mask annotations, which could be\ncomputation-consuming and less scalable. In this work, we rethink the RVOS\nproblem and aim to investigate the key to this task. Based on existing\nfoundation segmentation models, we decompose the RVOS task into referring,\nvideo, and segmentation factors, and propose a Temporal Prompt Generation and\nSelection (Tenet) framework to address the referring and video factors while\nleaving the segmentation problem to foundation models. To efficiently adapt\nimage-based foundation segmentation models to referring video object\nsegmentation, we leverage off-the-shelf object detectors and trackers to\nproduce temporal prompts associated with the referring sentence. While\nhigh-quality temporal prompts could be produced, they can not be easily\nidentified from confidence scores. To tackle this issue, we propose Prompt\nPreference Learning to evaluate the quality of the produced temporal prompts.\nBy taking such prompts to instruct image-based foundation segmentation models,\nwe would be able to produce high-quality masks for the referred object,\nenabling efficient model adaptation to referring video object segmentation.\nExperiments on RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the Tenet\nframework.",

It has high potential to transform how visual signals are\nprocessed and interpreted with the help of quantum computing that leverages\nquantum-mechanical effects in computations inaccessible to classical (i.e.\nnon-quantum) computers. In scenarios where existing non-quantum methods cannot\nfind a solution in a reasonable time or compute only approximate solutions,\nquantum computers can provide, among others, advantages in terms of better time\nscalability for multiple problem classes. Parametrised quantum circuits can\nalso become, in the long term, a considerable alternative to classical neural\nnetworks in computer vision. However, specialised and fundamentally new\nalgorithms must be developed to enable compatibility with quantum hardware and\nunveil the potential of quantum computational paradigms in computer vision.\nThis survey contributes to the existing literature on QeCV with a holistic\nreview of this research field. It is designed as a quantum computing reference\nfor the computer vision community, targeting computer vision students,\nscientists and readers with related backgrounds who want to familiarise\nthemselves with QeCV. We provide a comprehensive introduction to QeCV, its\nspecifics, and methodologies for formulations compatible with quantum hardware\nand QeCV methods, leveraging two main quantum computational paradigms, i.e.\ngate-based quantum computing and quantum annealing. We elaborate on the\noperational principles of quantum computers and the available tools to access,\nprogram and simulate them in the context of QeCV. Finally, we review existing\nquantum computing tools and learning materials and discuss aspects related to\npublishing and reviewing QeCV papers, open challenges and potential social\nimplications.",

To overcome the high\ncomplexity associated with pixel-space generation, we introduce two novel\ndesigns: 1) Semantics-Prompted Diffusion Transformers (SP-DiT), which\nincorporate semantic representations from vision foundation models into DiT to\nprompt the diffusion process, thereby preserving global semantic consistency\nwhile enhancing fine-grained visual details; and 2) Cascade DiT Design that\nprogressively increases the number of tokens to further enhance efficiency and\naccuracy.

        "summary": "Wrist-view observations are crucial for VLA models as they capture\nfine-grained hand-object interactions that directly enhance manipulation\nperformance. Yet large-scale datasets rarely include such recordings, resulting\nin a substantial gap between abundant anchor views and scarce wrist views.\nExisting world models cannot bridge this gap, as they require a wrist-view\nfirst frame and thus fail to generate wrist-view videos from anchor views\nalone. Amid this gap, recent visual geometry models such as VGGT emerge with\ngeometric and cross-view priors that make it possible to address extreme\nviewpoint shifts. Inspired by these insights, we propose WristWorld, the first\n4D world model that generates wrist-view videos solely from anchor views.\nWristWorld operates in two stages: (i) Reconstruction, which extends VGGT and\nincorporates our Spatial Projection Consistency (SPC) Loss to estimate\ngeometrically consistent wrist-view poses and 4D point clouds; (ii) Generation,\nwhich employs our video generation model to synthesize temporally coherent\nwrist-view videos from the reconstructed perspective. Experiments on Droid,\nCalvin, and Franka Panda demonstrate state-of-the-art video generation with\nsuperior spatial consistency, while also improving VLA performance, raising the\naverage task completion length on Calvin by 3.81% and closing 42.4% of the\nanchor-wrist view gap.",

        "summary": "Video DiTs have advanced video generation, yet they still struggle to model\nmulti-instance or subject-object interactions. This raises a key question: How\ndo these models internally represent interactions? To answer this, we curate\nMATRIX-11K, a video dataset with interaction-aware captions and multi-instance\nmask tracks. Using this dataset, we conduct a systematic analysis that\nformalizes two perspectives of video DiTs: semantic grounding, via\nvideo-to-text attention, which evaluates whether noun and verb tokens capture\ninstances and their relations; and semantic propagation, via video-to-video\nattention, which assesses whether instance bindings persist across frames. We\nfind both effects concentrate in a small subset of interaction-dominant layers.\nMotivated by this, we introduce MATRIX, a simple and effective regularization\nthat aligns attention in specific layers of video DiTs with multi-instance mask\ntracks from the MATRIX-11K dataset, enhancing both grounding and propagation.\nWe further propose InterGenEval, an evaluation protocol for interaction-aware\nvideo generation. In experiments, MATRIX improves both interaction fidelity and\nsemantic alignment while reducing drift and hallucination. Extensive ablations\nvalidate our design choices.

Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden\nconvolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency\ndomain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed\nby wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform\napproximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.\nIn the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse\nattacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,\nensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder\nleverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark\npattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We\nevaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,\ncapacity, and robustness.

        "summary": "Recent breakthroughs in video generation, powered by large-scale datasets and\ndiffusion techniques, have shown that video diffusion models can function as\nimplicit 4D novel view synthesizers. Nevertheless, current methods primarily\nconcentrate on redirecting camera trajectory within the front view while\nstruggling to generate 360-degree viewpoint changes. In this paper, we focus on\nhuman-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for\ncreating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To\nachieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset\nand incorporate an informative condition signal. Specifically, we use the\ncamera-dependent normal maps rendered from oriented partial point clouds, which\neffectively alleviate the ambiguity between seen and unseen observations. To\nmaintain synchronization in the generated videos, we propose a multi-view\nhuman-centric video diffusion model that fuses information from the reference\nvideo, partial rendering, and different viewpoints. Additionally, we provide a\nrobust inference procedure for in-the-wild video cases, which greatly mitigates\nthe artifacts induced by imperfect monocular depth estimation. Extensive\nexperiments on three datasets demonstrate our MV-Performer's state-of-the-art\neffectiveness and robustness, setting a strong model for human-centric 4D novel\nview synthesis.",

        "summary": "Recent endeavors to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs) have primarily focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness\nof these methods is typically assessed by measuring the accuracy drop on\nestablished benchmarks, comparing model performance before and after\ncompression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess the\nperception and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, rather than to evaluate\ncompression techniques. As a result, directly applying them to visual token\ncompression introduces a task mismatch. Strikingly, our investigation reveals\nthat simple image downsampling consistently outperforms many advanced\ncompression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through extensive\nexperiments, we make the following observations: (i) Current benchmarks are\nnoisy for the visual token compression task. (ii) Down-sampling is able to\nserve as a data filter to evaluate the difficulty of samples in the visual\ntoken compression task. Motivated by these findings, we introduce VTC-Bench, an\nevaluation framework that incorporates a data filtering mechanism to denoise\nexisting benchmarks, thereby enabling fairer and more accurate assessment of\nvisual token compression methods.

Yet, controlled generation remains\nchallenging, particularly in sensitive areas such as medical imaging.

However, existing DPMs\noperate in noisy latent spaces that lack semantic structure and strong priors,\nmaking it difficult to ensure meaningful control over generated content. To\naddress this, we propose graph-based object-level representations for\nGraph-Conditioned-Diffusion. Our approach generates graph nodes corresponding\nto each major structure in the image, encapsulating their individual features\nand relationships. These graph representations are processed by a transformer\nmodule and integrated into a diffusion model via the text-conditioning\nmechanism, enabling fine-grained control over generation.

        "title": "High-Rate Mixout: Revisiting Mixout for Robust Domain Generalization",
        "summary": "Ensembling fine-tuned models initialized from powerful pre-trained weights is\na common strategy to improve robustness under distribution shifts, but it comes\nwith substantial computational costs due to the need to train and store\nmultiple models. Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating\nensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to\npre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical\nrepresentations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate\nMixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to\nDropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout\nmitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned\nweights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby\nmaintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our\nstudy reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain\ngeneralization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9\nfor ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it\nyields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates\nmore strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting\nbetter generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking\nsubstantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by\nup to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%. Experiments across five\ndomain generalization benchmarks, PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraIncognita, and\nDomainNet, using ResNet and ViT architectures, show that our approach,\nHigh-rate Mixout, achieves out-of-domain accuracy comparable to ensemble-based\nmethods while significantly reducing training costs.",

        "summary": "In the domain of text-to-image generation, diffusion models have emerged as\npowerful tools. Recently, studies on visual prompting, where images are used as\nprompts, have enabled more precise control over style and content. However,\nexisting methods often suffer from content leakage, where undesired elements of\nthe visual style prompt are transferred along with the intended style. To\naddress this issue, we 1) extend classifier-free guidance (CFG) to utilize\nswapping self-attention and propose 2) negative visual query guidance (NVQG) to\nreduce the transfer of unwanted contents. NVQG employs negative score by\nintentionally simulating content leakage scenarios that swap queries instead of\nkey and values of self-attention layers from visual style prompts. This simple\nyet effective method significantly reduces content leakage. Furthermore, we\nprovide careful solutions for using a real image as visual style prompts.\nThrough extensive evaluation across various styles and text prompts, our method\ndemonstrates superiority over existing approaches, reflecting the style of the\nreferences, and ensuring that resulting images match the text prompts.

In this paper, we\nconsider the sub-problem of face detection, since this class provides\nmotivating applications involving safety and privacy, but do not tailor our\nmethod specifically to this class. Existing approaches rely on image sequences\nso that missing detections may be interpolated from surrounding frames or make\nuse of generative models to sample possible completions.

To bridge this gap, we propose a\nhistogram matching approach that transforms arbitrary noise towards a target\nGaussian distribution with known intensity. Moreover, a mutually reinforcing\ncycle is established between noise transformation and subsequent denoising.\nThis cycle progressively refines the noise to be converted, making it\napproximate the real noise, thereby enhancing the noise transformation effect\nand further improving the denoising performance. We tackle specific noise\ncomplexities: local histogram matching handles signal-dependent noise,\nintrapatch permutation processes channel-related noise, and frequency-domain\nhistogram matching coupled with pixel-shuffle down-sampling breaks spatial\ncorrelation. By applying these transformations, a single Gaussian denoiser\ngains remarkable capability to handle various out-of-distribution noises,\nincluding synthetic noises such as Poisson, salt-and-pepper and repeating\npattern noises, as well as complex real-world noises.

        "summary": "Persistent dynamic scene modeling for tracking and novel-view synthesis\nremains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing accurate deformations\nwhile maintaining computational efficiency. We propose SCas4D, a cascaded\noptimization framework that leverages structural patterns in 3D Gaussian\nSplatting for dynamic scenes. The key idea is that real-world deformations\noften exhibit hierarchical patterns, where groups of Gaussians share similar\ntransformations. By progressively refining deformations from coarse part-level\nto fine point-level, SCas4D achieves convergence within 100 iterations per time\nframe and produces results comparable to existing methods with only\none-twentieth of the training iterations. The approach also demonstrates\neffectiveness in self-supervised articulated object segmentation, novel view\nsynthesis, and dense point tracking tasks.",

Light field and LiDAR modalities provide\ncomplementary visual and spatial cues that are beneficial for robust\nperception; however, their effective integration is hindered by limited\nviewpoint diversity and inherent modality discrepancies. To address these\nchallenges, the first multimodal semantic segmentation dataset integrating\nlight field data and point cloud data is proposed. Based on this dataset, we\nproposed a multi-modal light field point-cloud fusion segmentation\nnetwork(Mlpfseg), incorporating feature completion and depth perception to\nsegment both camera images and LiDAR point clouds simultaneously. The feature\ncompletion module addresses the density mismatch between point clouds and image\npixels by performing differential reconstruction of point-cloud feature maps,\nenhancing the fusion of these modalities. The depth perception module improves\nthe segmentation of occluded objects by reinforcing attention scores for better\nocclusion awareness.

        "summary": "Recent advancements in instruction-based image editing and subject-driven\ngeneration have garnered significant attention, yet both tasks still face\nlimitations in meeting practical user needs. Instruction-based editing relies\nsolely on language instructions, which often fail to capture specific editing\ndetails, making reference images necessary. Meanwhile, subject-driven\ngeneration is limited to combining concrete objects or people, overlooking\nbroader, abstract concepts. To address these challenges, we propose two novel\ntasks: multimodal instruction-based editing and generation. These tasks support\nboth text and image instructions and extend the scope to include both concrete\nand abstract concepts, greatly enhancing their practical applications. We\nintroduce DreamOmni2, tackling two primary challenges: data creation and model\nframework design. Our data synthesis pipeline consists of three steps: (1)\nusing a feature mixing method to create extraction data for both abstract and\nconcrete concepts, (2) generating multimodal instruction-based editing training\ndata using the editing and extraction models, and (3) further applying the\nextraction model to create training data for multimodal instruction-based\nediting. For the framework, to handle multi-image input, we propose an index\nencoding and position encoding shift scheme, which helps the model distinguish\nimages and avoid pixel confusion. Additionally, we introduce joint training\nwith the VLM and our generation/editing model to better process complex\ninstructions. In addition, we have proposed comprehensive benchmarks for these\ntwo new tasks to drive their development. Experiments show that DreamOmni2 has\nachieved impressive results.

        "summary": "Aortic aneurysm disease ranks consistently in the top 20 causes of death in\nthe U.S. population. Thoracic aortic aneurysm is manifested as an abnormal\nbulging of thoracic aortic wall and it is a leading cause of death in adults.\nFrom the perspective of biomechanics, rupture occurs when the stress acting on\nthe aortic wall exceeds the wall strength. Wall stress distribution can be\nobtained by computational biomechanical analyses, especially structural Finite\nElement Analysis. For risk assessment, probabilistic rupture risk of TAA can be\ncalculated by comparing stress with material strength using a material failure\nmodel. Although these engineering tools are currently available for TAA rupture\nrisk assessment on patient specific level, clinical adoption has been limited\ndue to two major barriers: labor intensive 3D reconstruction current patient\nspecific anatomical modeling still relies on manual segmentation, making it\ntime consuming and difficult to scale to a large patient population, and\ncomputational burden traditional FEA simulations are resource intensive and\nincompatible with time sensitive clinical workflows. The second barrier was\nsuccessfully overcome by our team through the development of the PyTorch FEA\nlibrary and the FEA DNN integration framework. By incorporating the FEA\nfunctionalities within PyTorch FEA and applying the principle of static\ndeterminacy, we reduced the FEA based stress computation time to approximately\nthree minutes per case. Moreover, by integrating DNN and FEA through the\nPyTorch FEA library, our approach further decreases the computation time to\nonly a few seconds per case. This work focuses on overcoming the first barrier\nthrough the development of an end to end deep neural network capable of\ngenerating patient specific finite element meshes of the aorta directly from 3D\nCT images.",

Existing methods typically\nemploy tokenizers in discrete latent spaces to align with the tokens from large\nlanguage models, where the quantization errors can limit semantic\nexpressiveness and degrade the capability of vision-language understanding. To\naddress this, we introduce MingTok, a new family of visual tokenizers with a\ncontinuous latent space, for unified autoregressive generation and\nunderstanding. While understanding tasks favor discriminative high-dimensional\nfeatures, generation tasks prefer compact low-level codes. Thus, to reconcile\nthese competing demands, MingTok adopts a three-stage sequential architecture\ninvolving low-level encoding, semantic expansion, and visual reconstruction.\nBuilt on top of it, Ming-UniVision eliminates the need for task-specific visual\nrepresentations, and unifies diverse vision-language tasks under a single\nautoregrsssive prediction paradigm. By formulating both understanding and\ngeneration as next-token prediction in a shared continuous space, it seamlessly\nsupports multi-round, in-context tasks such as iterative understanding,\ngeneration and editing. Empirically, we find that using a unified continuous\nvisual representation reconciles the competing requirements on the tokenizers\nby the understanding and generation tasks, thereby leading to state-of-the-art\nlevel performance across both domains.

        "summary": "Deep learning models which perform well on images from their training\ndistribution can degrade substantially when applied to new distributions. If a\nCT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the\nmodel may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design\nfeatures which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate\nartifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images\nfrom this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,\nthis study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that\nmaintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without\ncorresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in\nsinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against\nbaseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT\ndataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean\nimages fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional\naugmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen\nartifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high\nclassification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact\ndata during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for\nartifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification\nperformance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained\nwith labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to\nuniform noise. These findings provide empirical evidence that domain adaptation\ncan effectively address distribution shift in medical imaging without requiring\nexpensive expert labeling of new artifact distributions, suggesting promise for\ndeployment in clinical settings where novel artifacts may emerge.",

        "summary": "Existing deep learning approaches for image super-resolution, particularly\nthose based on CNNs and attention mechanisms, often suffer from structural\ninflexibility. Although graph-based methods offer greater representational\nadaptability, they are frequently impeded by excessive computational\ncomplexity. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes the\nHeterogeneous Subgraph Network (HSNet), a novel framework that efficiently\nleverages graph modeling while maintaining computational feasibility. The core\nidea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.\nFirst, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates\na diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single\nmonolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by\nmodeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a\nrich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the\nSubgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across\nthese subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,\nSAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures\nintricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is\ndesigned to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing\naccuracy while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that HSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively\nbalancing reconstruction quality with computational efficiency. The code will\nbe made publicly available.",

        "summary": "While modern deep neural networks achieve impressive performance in vision\ntasks, they remain opaque in their decision processes, risking unwarranted\ntrust, undetected biases and unexpected failures. We propose cluster paths, a\npost-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers\nand represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these\ncluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),\nweighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness\n(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a\nspurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts\nand collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,\nthey achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise\nwithout sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on\nImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a\nlarge language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster\npaths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably\nflagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident\npredictions. Cluster paths uncover visual concepts, such as color palettes,\ntextures, or object contexts, at multiple network depths, demonstrating that\ncluster paths scale to large vision models while generating concise and\nhuman-readable explanations.",

To address\nthese limitations, we propose our Text2Interact framework, designed to generate\nrealistic, text-aligned human-human interactions through a scalable\nhigh-fidelity interaction data synthesizer and an effective spatiotemporal\ncoordination pipeline. First, we present InterCompose, a scalable\nsynthesis-by-composition pipeline that aligns LLM-generated interaction\ndescriptions with strong single-person motion priors. Given a prompt and a\nmotion for an agent, InterCompose retrieves candidate single-person motions,\ntrains a conditional reaction generator for another agent, and uses a neural\nmotion evaluator to filter weak or misaligned samples-expanding interaction\ncoverage without extra capture. Second, we propose InterActor, a\ntext-to-interaction model with word-level conditioning that preserves\ntoken-level cues (initiation, response, contact ordering) and an adaptive\ninteraction loss that emphasizes contextually relevant inter-person joint\npairs, improving coupling and physical plausibility for fine-grained\ninteraction modeling.

We further provide analysis explicitly linking posterior\ncovariance to distribution mismatch, establishing it as a reliable signal for\nOOD detection. To ensure tractability, we adopt a Jacobian-free subspace\niteration method to estimate the leading eigenvalues using only forward\nevaluations of the denoiser. Empirically, EigenScore achieves SOTA performance,\nwith up to 5% AUROC improvement over the best baseline. Notably, it remains\nrobust in near-OOD settings such as CIFAR-10 vs CIFAR-100, where existing\ndiffusion-based methods often fail.",

        "summary": "Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models (RSVLMs) have shown remarkable\npotential thanks to large-scale pretraining, achieving strong zero-shot\nperformance on various tasks. However, their ability to generalize in low-data\nregimes, such as few-shot learning, remains insufficiently explored. In this\nwork, we present the first structured benchmark for evaluating few-shot\nadaptation methods on RSVLMs. We conduct comprehensive experiments across ten\nremote sensing scene classification datasets, applying five widely used\nfew-shot adaptation strategies to three state-of-the-art RSVLMs with varying\nbackbones. Our findings reveal that models with similar zero-shot performance\ncan exhibit markedly different behavior under few-shot adaptation, with some\nRSVLMs being inherently more amenable to such adaptation than others. The\nvariability of performance and the absence of a clear winner among existing\nmethods highlight the need for the development of more robust methods for\nfew-shot adaptation tailored to RS. To facilitate future research, we provide a\nreproducible benchmarking framework and open-source code to systematically\nevaluate RSVLMs under few-shot conditions.

        "summary": "Embodied Visual Tracking (EVT) is a fundamental ability that underpins\npractical applications, such as companion robots, guidance robots and service\nassistants, where continuously following moving targets is essential. Recent\nadvances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured\nscenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and\neffective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the\npresence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we\npresent TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances\nembodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism\nand a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a\nChain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative\nposition and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action\nprediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update\nstrategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal\nconsistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive\nexperiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on\npublic benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings. On the\nchallenging EVT-Bench DT split, TrackVLA++ surpasses the previous leading\napproach by 5.1 and 12, respectively. Furthermore, TrackVLA++ exhibits strong\nzero-shot generalization, enabling robust real-world tracking in dynamic and\noccluded scenarios.",

We introduce the\ntext-to-3D adversarial generation method, a novel approach enabling physically\nrealizable attacks that can generate 3D models of objects truly invisible to\nLiDAR detectors and be easily realized in the real world. Specifically, we\npresent the first empirical study that systematically investigates the factors\ninfluencing detection vulnerability by manipulating the topology, connectivity,\nand intensity of individual pedestrian 3D models and combining pedestrians with\nmultiple objects within the CARLA simulation environment.

This task faces unique\nchallenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,\nwithout the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nnovel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)\nwhich explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging\nthe discrepancies between predicted and actual information.

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in spatial\nreasoning, yet they remain fundamentally limited to qualitative precision and\nlack the computational precision required for real-world robotics. Current\napproaches fail to leverage metric cues from depth sensors and camera\ncalibration, instead reducing geometric problems to pattern recognition tasks\nthat cannot deliver the centimeter-level accuracy essential for robotic\nmanipulation. We present TIGeR (Tool-Integrated Geometric Reasoning), a novel\nframework that transforms VLMs from perceptual estimators to geometric\ncomputers by enabling them to generate and execute precise geometric\ncomputations through external tools. Rather than attempting to internalize\ncomplex geometric operations within neural networks, TIGeR empowers models to\nrecognize geometric reasoning requirements, synthesize appropriate\ncomputational code, and invoke specialized libraries for exact calculations. To\nsupport this paradigm, we introduce TIGeR-300K, a comprehensive\ntool-invocation-oriented dataset covering point transformations, pose\nestimation, trajectory generation, and spatial compatibility verification,\ncomplete with tool invocation sequences and intermediate computations. Through\na two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nreinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) with our proposed hierarchical reward design,\nTIGeR achieves SOTA performance on geometric reasoning benchmarks while\ndemonstrating centimeter-level precision in real-world robotic manipulation\ntasks.",

        "summary": "Face recognition in unconstrained environments such as surveillance, video,\nand web imagery must contend with extreme variation in pose, blur,\nillumination, and occlusion, where conventional visual quality metrics fail to\npredict whether inputs are truly recognizable to the deployed encoder. Existing\nFIQA methods typically rely on visual heuristics, curated annotations, or\ncomputationally intensive generative pipelines, leaving their predictions\ndetached from the encoder's decision geometry. We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer\nLearning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and\nannotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding\nspace. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability\nvia class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),\nyielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering\nand weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that\nachieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly\ndoubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,\nheuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond\nfaces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations\nand subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first\nrecognizability-aware body recognition assessment. Experiments confirm\nstate-of-the-art results on faces, strong performance on body recognition, and\nrobustness under cross-dataset shifts. Together, these contributions establish\nTransFIRA as a unified, geometry-driven framework for recognizability\nassessment -- encoder-specific, accurate, interpretable, and extensible across\nmodalities -- significantly advancing FIQA in accuracy, explainability, and\nscope.",

While deep learning has shown promising results\nfor automatically detecting this condition from fundus images, its application\nremains challenging due the limited availability of annotated data. Foundation\nModels (FM) have emerged as an alternative solution. However, it is unclear if\nthey can cope with DME detection in particular. In this paper, we\nsystematically compare different FM and standard transfer learning approaches\nfor this task. Specifically, we compare the two most popular FM for retinal\nimages--RETFound and FLAIR--and an EfficientNet-B0 backbone, across different\ntraining regimes and evaluation settings in IDRiD, MESSIDOR-2 and\nOCT-and-Eye-Fundus-Images (OEFI). Results show that despite their scale, FM do\nnot consistently outperform fine-tuned CNNs in this task. In particular, an\nEfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and\nprecision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing\npromising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive\nzero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted\nappropriately.

Notably, the FL methods demonstrated resilience to\ninconsistently normalized data across clients, achieving the 3D Dice score of\n92%, which is comparable to a centralized model (trained using all data).

        "summary": "Over the past decade, U-Net has been the dominant architecture in medical\nimage segmentation, leading to the development of thousands of U-shaped\nvariants. Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive\nbenchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely\nbecause of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of\nefficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we\npresent U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that\nevaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our\ncontributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates\nmodels along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot\ngeneralization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,\nU-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering\na deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis\nand Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale\nevaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and\narchitectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we\npropose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most\nsuitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We\nprovide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to\nreproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,\nU-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a\nfoundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the\nnext decade of U-Net-based segmentation models.

In this paper,\nwe focus the attention on a novel approach to classification of yearly\nsatellite image time series (SITS) that combines deep learning with Bayesian\nmodelling, using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) integrated with Transformer\nEncoder (TE) based DNNs. The proposed approach aims to capture both i)\nintricate temporal correlations in yearly SITS and ii) specific patterns in\nmultiyear crop type sequences. It leverages the cascade classification of an\nHMM layer built on top of the TE, discerning consistent yearly crop-type\nsequences. Validation on a multiyear crop type classification dataset spanning\n47 crop types and six years of Sentinel-2 acquisitions demonstrates the\nimportance of modelling temporal consistency in the predicted labels. HMMs\nenhance the overall performance and F1 scores, emphasising the effectiveness of\nthe proposed approach.",

We revisit Mixout, a\nstochastic regularizer that intermittently replaces finetuned weights with\ntheir pretrained reference, through the lens of a single-run, weight-sharing\nimplicit ensemble. This perspective reveals three key levers that govern\nrobustness: the \\emph{masking anchor}, \\emph{resampling frequency}, and\n\\emph{mask sparsity}. Guided by this analysis, we introduce GMixout, which (i)\nreplaces the fixed anchor with an exponential moving-average snapshot that\nadapts during training, and (ii) regulates masking period via an explicit\nresampling-frequency hyperparameter. Our sparse-kernel implementation updates\nonly a small fraction of parameters with no inference-time overhead, enabling\ntraining on consumer-grade GPUs. Experiments on benchmarks covering covariate\nshift, corruption, and class imbalance, ImageNet / ImageNet-LT, DomainNet,\niWildCam, and CIFAR100-C, GMixout consistently improves in-domain accuracy\nbeyond zero-shot performance while surpassing both Model Soups and strong\nparameter-efficient finetuning baselines under distribution shift.",

        "summary": "LiDAR semantic segmentation is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile\nrobots, requiring high accuracy and real-time processing, especially on\nresource-constrained embedded systems. Previous state-of-the-art methods often\nface a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse\nconvolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of\nneighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but\nlose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,\nmany recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve\nperformance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing\nphase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded\nplatforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR\nsemantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing\nmethodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design\nthe Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture\nrepresentations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a\nmulti-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple\nabstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing\naccuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that\nHARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all\nstate-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is\ncomparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\\times$ faster.

A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality\ndistributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability\nof conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA\nwith Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions\nwhile mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image\nclassification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical\nanalyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is\nnecessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT\ninduces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.\nTo address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization\n(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers\nwhile adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a\nmanifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current\nrepresentation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global\ndistributions. We construct four CAQA benchmarks from three datasets with\ntailored evaluation protocols and strong baselines, enabling systematic\ncross-dataset comparison.

In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by\nfoundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is\ndesigned to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior\nsonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by\nthe practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past\nexplorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action\nAdapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode\nvision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance. With built-in\nsequential reasoning capabilities in a compact design, the VA-Adapter enables a\npre-trained ultrasound foundation model to learn precise probe adjustment\nstrategies by fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters.

        "summary": "The quantity and the quality of the training labels are central problems in\nhigh-resolution land-cover mapping with machine-learning-based solutions. In\nthis context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on\nexisting low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,\nSentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived\nland-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch.

        "title": "Automated Neural Architecture Design for Industrial Defect Detection",
        "summary": "Industrial surface defect detection (SDD) is critical for ensuring product\nquality and manufacturing reliability. Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of\nsurface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and\ninterclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed\nmodels, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address\nboth challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated\nneural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over\nconvolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design\nenables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range\nsemantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of\nmanual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search\nspace, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates\nsupernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a\nsearchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to\nenhance multi-scale feature learning. Beyond detection accuracy, runtime\nefficiency is essential for industrial deployment. To this end, AutoNAD\nincorporates a latency-aware prior to guide the selection of efficient\narchitectures. The effectiveness of AutoNAD is validated on three industrial\ndefect datasets and further applied within a defect imaging and detection\nplatform.

        "summary": "Symbolic regression aims to find interpretable analytical expressions by\nsearching over mathematical formula spaces to capture underlying system\nbehavior, particularly in scientific modeling governed by physical laws.\nHowever, traditional methods lack mechanisms for extracting structured physical\npriors from time series observations, making it difficult to capture symbolic\nexpressions that reflect the system's global behavior. In this work, we propose\na structure-aware symbolic regression framework, called StruSR, that leverages\ntrained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to extract locally structured\nphysical priors from time series data. By performing local Taylor expansions on\nthe outputs of the trained PINN, we obtain derivative-based structural\ninformation to guide symbolic expression evolution. To assess the importance of\nexpression components, we introduce a masking-based attribution mechanism that\nquantifies each subtree's contribution to structural alignment and physical\nresidual reduction. These sensitivity scores steer mutation and crossover\noperations within genetic programming, preserving substructures with high\nphysical or structural significance while selectively modifying less\ninformative components. A hybrid fitness function jointly minimizes physics\nresiduals and Taylor coefficient mismatch, ensuring consistency with both the\ngoverning equations and the local analytical behavior encoded by the PINN.\nExperiments on benchmark PDE systems demonstrate that StruSR improves\nconvergence speed, structural fidelity, and expression interpretability\ncompared to conventional baselines, offering a principled paradigm for\nphysics-grounded symbolic discovery.",

        "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained increasing attention for their\nsuperior energy efficiency compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).\nHowever, their security aspects, particularly under backdoor attacks, have\nreceived limited attention. Existing defense methods developed for ANNs perform\npoorly or can be easily bypassed in SNNs due to their event-driven and temporal\ndependencies. This paper identifies the key blockers that hinder traditional\nbackdoor defenses in SNNs and proposes an unsupervised post-training detection\nframework, Temporal Membrane Potential Backdoor Detection (TMPBD), to overcome\nthese challenges. TMPBD leverages the maximum margin statistics of temporal\nmembrane potential (TMP) in the final spiking layer to detect target labels\nwithout any attack knowledge or data access. We further introduce a robust\nmitigation mechanism, Neural Dendrites Suppression Backdoor Mitigation (NDSBM),\nwhich clamps dendritic connections between early convolutional layers to\nsuppress malicious neurons while preserving benign behaviors, guided by TMP\nextracted from a small, clean, unlabeled dataset. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple neuromorphic benchmarks and state-of-the-art input-aware dynamic\ntrigger attacks demonstrate that TMPBD achieves 100% detection accuracy, while\nNDSBM reduces the attack success rate from 100% to 8.44%, and to 2.81% when\ncombined with detection, without degrading clean accuracy.",

However, differences in staining protocols and imaging conditions can\nintroduce significant color variability. In deep learning, such color\ninconsistency often reduces performance when deploying models on data acquired\nunder different conditions from the training data, a challenge known as domain\nshift. Many existing methods attempt to address this problem via color\nnormalization but suffer from several notable drawbacks such as introducing\nartifacts or requiring careful choice of a template image for stain mapping. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a trainable color normalization model\nthat can be integrated with any backbone network for downstream tasks such as\nobject detection and classification. Based on the physics of the imaging\nprocess per the Beer-Lambert law, our model architecture is derived via\nalgorithmic unrolling of a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) model to\nextract stain-invariant structural information from the original pathology\nimages, which serves as input for further processing.

These materials pose a unique problem for\ntraditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can\ncause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and\npotential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to\naccurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often\nrely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational\nburdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots.\nIn this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for\ndetecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our\nmethod fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor\nwith a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach\naccurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into\ncorresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent\nobstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a\nsmall fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor. We validate our system\nthrough a series of experiments in both controlled and real-world environments,\ndemonstrating the utility of our method through experiments where the robot\nmaps indoor environments containing glass.

Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and\n1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The\nprimary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2\nachieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to\n512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and\nImageNet.

In\nchest radiography, higher input resolution is critical for leveraging the\nbenefits of modern self-supervised models. 512x512 pixels represent a practical\nupper limit where DINOv3-initialized ConvNeXt-B networks provide the strongest\nperformance, while larger inputs offer minimal return on cost. Clinically,\nthese findings support use of finetuned, mid-sized backbones at 512x512 for\nchest radiograph interpretation, with the greatest gains expected in detecting\nsubtle or boundary-centered lesions relevant to emergency and critical care\nsettings.",

        "title": "The False Promise of Zero-Shot Super-Resolution in Machine-Learned Operators",
        "summary": "A core challenge in scientific machine learning, and scientific computing\nmore generally, is modeling continuous phenomena which (in practice) are\nrepresented discretely. Machine-learned operators (MLOs) have been introduced\nas a means to achieve this modeling goal, as this class of architecture can\nperform inference at arbitrary resolution. In this work, we evaluate whether\nthis architectural innovation is sufficient to perform \"zero-shot\nsuper-resolution,\" namely to enable a model to serve inference on\nhigher-resolution data than that on which it was originally trained. We\ncomprehensively evaluate both zero-shot sub-resolution and super-resolution\n(i.e., multi-resolution) inference in MLOs. We decouple multi-resolution\ninference into two key behaviors: 1) extrapolation to varying frequency\ninformation; and 2) interpolating across varying resolutions. We empirically\ndemonstrate that MLOs fail to do both of these tasks in a zero-shot manner.\nConsequently, we find MLOs are not able to perform accurate inference at\nresolutions different from those on which they were trained, and instead they\nare brittle and susceptible to aliasing. To address these failure modes, we\npropose a simple, computationally-efficient, and data-driven multi-resolution\ntraining protocol that overcomes aliasing and that provides robust\nmulti-resolution generalization.",

        "title": "Through the Perspective of LiDAR: A Feature-Enriched and Uncertainty-Aware Annotation Pipeline for Terrestrial Point Cloud Segmentation",
        "summary": "Accurate semantic segmentation of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point\nclouds is limited by costly manual annotation. We propose a semi-automated,\nuncertainty-aware pipeline that integrates spherical projection, feature\nenrichment, ensemble learning, and targeted annotation to reduce labeling\neffort, while sustaining high accuracy. Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D\nspherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an\nensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty\nmaps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions. The 2D outputs are\nback-projected to 3D, yielding densely annotated point clouds supported by a\nthree-tier visualization suite (2D feature maps, 3D colorized point clouds, and\ncompact virtual spheres) for rapid triage and reviewer guidance. Using this\npipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove\nforests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address\ntwo key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which\nfeatures matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12\nannotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact\nnine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean\nIntersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76. Finally, we confirm\nthe generalization of our feature-enrichment strategy through cross-dataset\ntests on ForestSemantic and Semantic3D.\n  Our contributions include: (i) a robust, uncertainty-aware TLS annotation\npipeline with visualization tools; (ii) the Mangrove3D dataset; and (iii)\nempirical guidance on data efficiency and feature importance, thus enabling\nscalable, high-quality segmentation of TLS point clouds for ecological\nmonitoring and beyond.
