        "summary": "Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,\nyet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their\ngeneralizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types\nlike textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance\nwhen deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,\nwe propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based\non a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the\ncomplex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:\nlocal structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global\nlogical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert\nnetworks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in\nreconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic\nlevel. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently\nunderstand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce\nan Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an\nExpert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization\nof all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial\nimaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical\nanomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art\nperformance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their\nrespective domains.",

        "summary": "Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is\nseverely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a\nnovel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for\nlow labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled\nsamples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --\na generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for\nauthenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --\nwithin a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between\nsupervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that\nleverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather\nthan generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that\ncombines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier\nwith temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling\nreliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across\neleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically\nsignificant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised\nmethods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting\nwhere the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging.

        "title": "Mixture of Experts Guided by Gaussian Splatters Matters: A new Approach to Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection",
        "summary": "Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of\nanomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the\nWeakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided\nduring training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although\nstate-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),\nthey struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This\ndifficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to\naddress the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a\nshared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak\nsupervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the\nability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To\naddress these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of\nExperts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each\nspecialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a\ntemporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal\nconsistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach\nencourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by\nfocusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The\npredictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a\nmixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse\nanomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a\n91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on\nXD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and\ntemporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.",

To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA\n(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in\nMLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,\napplies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize\ntask-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss\nto preserve consistency in shared representations over time.

        "summary": "In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the\nintegrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a\nkey research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods\nrely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated\ndatasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,\nlimiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent\nstudies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level\nannotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches\noften depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process\ninefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on\ndiffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and\nCIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data\ndistribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on\nlarge-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even\nunder limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding\nmechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between\nIML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,\nthe end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data\nannotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets\ndemonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and\n4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the\nproposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and\nrobustness.",

        "summary": "Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot\nperformance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.\nTest-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test\ndata in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,\ntraining-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,\ncurrent cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence\nsamples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the\ninfluence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient\nTest-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that\nintegrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision\nboundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating\ncontextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and\ncomputational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to\nreduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting\noptimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores\nfrom both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary\nstrengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses\nthe state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,\nsetting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation.

Nevertheless,\ngenerative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input\nimage do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be\ninferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar\nrelighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned\nmaterial-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary\nnumber of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues\nfrom inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material\ninformation cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method\nconsistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with\ndiverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction\nquality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly\nrelight from images.

        "summary": "Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a\ncentral part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are\nstill falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging\nbenchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are\noften restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could\ncompromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this\nstudy, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual\ndetails improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a\nfive-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation\nfor single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on\nearlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated\nfigures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer\n(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of\nfine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which\ncontains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring\n250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD\nconsistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world\nand synthetic test sets.

        "summary": "Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the\ndemand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface\nTemperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from\nremote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between\nspatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer\npromising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m\nresolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative\nNetwork for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra\nMODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning\nframework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative\nadversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature\nextraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage\nemploys a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from\nthe inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,\nnormalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the\nfused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to\nsuppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy\nbased on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN\ndiscriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods\nin both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the\nbest-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves\nSSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and\neffectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33\nground-based sensors.

        "summary": "Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success\nin addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still\nsuffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the\nbackground and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior\nworks showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,\nexhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce\nTRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language\nmodality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates\npseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel\nuncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to\nestimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated\nuncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the\nadverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To\nfurther increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal\nsoft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature\nspaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision\nmodel on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as\nboth a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are\nattracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their\ncaptions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and\nnegative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms\nprevious methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and\ncomplex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.",

        "summary": "High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of\nvisual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.\nIn many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution\nimages can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,\nsuper-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to\nreconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related\ntraditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on\npixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image\nfidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This\nraises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into\nthe super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this\npaper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship\nbetween super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a\nspecialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases\nthe resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions\nthat account for both image quality and classification performance. Our\napproach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained\nimage quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.",

        "summary": "Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from\ndense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading\nto artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models\n(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views\nare available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these\nmethods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present\nFVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel\nview synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel\nvideo diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising\nteacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.\nExtensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous\nworks, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or\neven better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.\nFVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction\ntasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where\npre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial\ncoverage.",

This\nchallenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,\nwhere performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve\nincreasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or\nadditional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.\nSynthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural\nconsistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in\ncreating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)\ntrained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that\nresemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural\nfidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the\nsegmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in\nmulti-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and\nvanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,\ndomain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain\ndata, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the\nsource domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation\nperformance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based\nmetrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on\nreal data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning\nor online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image\nanalysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.",

        "summary": "Although computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) and detection (CADe) systems have\nmade significant progress in various medical domains, their application is\nstill limited in specialized fields such as otorhinolaryngology. In the latter,\ncurrent assessment methods heavily depend on operator expertise, and the high\nheterogeneity of lesions complicates diagnosis, with biopsy persisting as the\ngold standard despite its substantial costs and risks. A critical bottleneck\nfor specialized endoscopic CADx/e systems is the lack of well-annotated\ndatasets with sufficient variability for real-world generalization. This study\nintroduces a novel approach that exploits a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM)\ncoupled with a ControlNet adapter to generate laryngeal endoscopic\nimage-annotation pairs, guided by clinical observations. The method addresses\ndata scarcity by conditioning the diffusion process to produce realistic,\nhigh-quality, and clinically relevant image features that capture diverse\nanatomical conditions. The proposed approach can be leveraged to expand\ntraining datasets for CADx/e models, empowering the assessment process in\nlaryngology. Indeed, during a downstream task of detection, the addition of\nonly 10% synthetic data improved the detection rate of laryngeal lesions by 9%\nwhen the model was internally tested and 22.1% on out-of-domain external data.\nAdditionally, the realism of the generated images was evaluated by asking 5\nexpert otorhinolaryngologists with varying expertise to rate their confidence\nin distinguishing synthetic from real images. This work has the potential to\naccelerate the development of automated tools for laryngeal disease diagnosis,\noffering a solution to data scarcity and demonstrating the applicability of\nsynthetic data in real-world scenarios.",

The research introduces a unique multidirectional\narchitectural framework to automate polyp detection within colonoscopy images\nwhile helping resolve limited healthcare dataset sizes and annotation\ncomplexities. The research implements a comprehensive system that delivers\nsynthetic data generation through Stable Diffusion enhancements together with\ndetection and segmentation algorithms. This detection approach combines Faster\nR-CNN for initial object localization while the Segment Anything Model (SAM)\nrefines the segmentation masks. The faster R-CNN detection algorithm achieved a\nrecall of 93.08% combined with a precision of 88.97% and an F1 score of\n90.98%.SAM is then used to generate the image mask. The research evaluated five\nstate-of-the-art segmentation models that included U-Net, PSPNet, FPN, LinkNet,\nand MANet using ResNet34 as a base model. The results demonstrate the superior\nperformance of FPN with the highest scores of PSNR (7.205893) and SSIM\n(0.492381), while UNet excels in recall (84.85%) and LinkNet shows balanced\nperformance in IoU (64.20%) and Dice score (77.53%).",

While NeRF\nextensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP\nreliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We\nintroduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for\nrobust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play\nlearnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for\nspatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware\nUncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating\nGaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The\npipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy\nGaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP\npruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean\nUnattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned\nphysics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light\ntransport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior\nperformance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on\nSeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet\ntheir high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited\nplatforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal\ndiffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,\nis it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a\ncheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps\nincreases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model\nmore sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes\nthe differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training\ncompression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,\na training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by\nreducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training\nmanner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme\nbased on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising\nsteps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation\nfidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to\nreuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation\nstudies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the\nfidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to\nboost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing\nper-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of\ndenoising steps.

Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become\noutdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination\nissues. To address these problems, we propose \\textbf{SDEval}, the\n\\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the\ndistribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly\nadopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to\ngenerate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual\neffects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that\ninjecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,\ninjecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is\ngeneral enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability\nbenchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and\ncapability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly\ninfluences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety\nlimitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval",

This paper proposes a diffusion-based\nsolution to learn human motion priors and fuse the two modalities of signals\ntogether seamlessly in a unified framework. By delicately considering the\ncharacteristics of the two signals, the sequential visual information is\nconsidered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the\ninertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to\nconstruct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that\nthe visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or\nsubjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential\nvisual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the\noccasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other\nhand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when\nsignal transmission has no problem.

In general, SynSeg\neffectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination\nunder weak supervision.

        "summary": "Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.\nExisting human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of\nemotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive\ntasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel\ntask: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional\ncues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and\nincorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging\nproblem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion\nprior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction\nsynthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a\nshort sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a\nsemi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,\nwe further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by\nconsidering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a\nmotion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions\nunder various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nmodel outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will\nbe made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/",

        "title": "Q-CLIP: Unleashing the Power of Vision-Language Models for Video Quality Assessment through Unified Cross-Modal Adaptation",
        "summary": "Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key\nresearch challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve\nperformance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,\nImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this\nstrategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic\nknowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality\ndepends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);\n(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational\nresources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training\ndirectly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown\nremarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and\nhave begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this\nwork, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP\nenhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal\nAdapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters\nand is the only component that requires training. This design significantly\nreduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable\nquality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality\nvariations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.\nFurthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies\non VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to\nbetter generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.",

        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on\nmultimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their\ninference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of\nvision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods\noften rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt\nguidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during\ninference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play\nframework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a\nfine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise\ntext-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token\nimportance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.\nSecond, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and\nidentify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to\npropose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is\nlightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.\nExperimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.\nFor example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\\% while maintaining an average\naccuracy of 92.9\\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B.

        "summary": "Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and\nefficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,\nparticularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,\nhindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a\nunified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We\npropose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.\nThis offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models\nare more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better\nvideo editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and\naligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data\nsynthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data\nsynthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and\nbackgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,\nbackground changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of\naccurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE\non extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing\ntypes and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,\ncollage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative\ndrop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite\nbeing hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.\nTherefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.\nBesides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We\nbuild on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop\napproach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and\neditability.

In this paper, we\nintroduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language\nmodels (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual\nanimation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual\nperception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes\npoint-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between\nmodels.

Despite recent\nadvances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:\n\\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and\n\\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in\nreal-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\n\\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large\nmultimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video\nquality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.\nSpecifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided\nreinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality\nunder score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a\n\\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction\nerror decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;\n(2) a \\textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly\ndetermine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \\textbf{temporal\nconsistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent\nvideos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD\nVQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.\nFurthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its\nsuperiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to\nexisting explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that\nreinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building\ngeneralizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.",

        "title": "NEP: Autoregressive Image Editing via Next Editing Token Prediction",
        "summary": "Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a\nlanguage instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local\nregions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather\nthan selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in\n(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing\nnon-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To\nresolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next\nEditing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where\nonly regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended\nmodification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose\nto pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once\ntrained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to\nNEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used\nimage editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time\nscaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot\nmanner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/",

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image\nplaceholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from\nan image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).\nHowever, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context\nlength, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While\nprevious efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or\nleveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise\nperformance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose\nFourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual\nrepresentations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the\nobservation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit\nconcentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a\nlow-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier\nTransform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log n)$,\nminimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional\nparameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks\ndemonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong\ngeneralizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it\nreduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%\ncompared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.",

        "summary": "Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use\nfixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing\ntypes. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained\ntext-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but\ntypically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to\ndistinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we\npropose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts\nand clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based\nopen-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal\nrepresentations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe\nthat, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D\ntexture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling\nstronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum\nintroduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --\nobtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved\nalignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract\nhuman-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate\nsemantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through\nprompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation\nmaps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone\ngarments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We\nconduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,\nclothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and\ndemonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in\nprompt-based segmentation.",

        "summary": "Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with\ndeep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the\ndistinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.\nHowever, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle\ntypes within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class\nclassifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less\neffective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for\nparticle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as\nsilicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining\nlarge numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively\nstraightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to\naddress data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment\ntraining datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural\nnetworks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples\nclosely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.\nTo assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training\ndatasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising\n500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves\nclassification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote\nopen research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion\nmodels and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with\na straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at\nhttps://github.com/utkuozbulak/svp-generative-ai.",

This imbalance arises from\nvariable-length text inputs and varying visual token counts in mixed-resolution\nand image-video joint training. KnapFormer redistributes tokens by first\ngathering sequence length metadata across all ranks in a balancing group and\nsolving a global knapsack problem.

        "summary": "Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer\ninteraction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025\ncompetition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To\naddress the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models\nto extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.\nSpecifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder\nthat captures both global frame-level features and localized facial\nrepresentations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched\nmethod that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the\ninput text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a\nfusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms\nfor dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original\nrepresentations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in\nthe training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a\nsubstantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the\nMER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to\n78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.",

        "summary": "3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and\nbroad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed\nscenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains\nchallenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct\nlocation and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic\ninterpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may\nexhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In\naddition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera\nmovements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a\nspecified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues\nin a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that\nautomatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any\ninterpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a\ntraining-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to\nmatch the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual\nintegration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the\n4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,\nenabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera\nmovements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene\nvideos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various\ncamera and action combinations.",

Existing methods that directly train LLMs or\nbridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the\nbackbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We\npresent Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs\n(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent\nvariables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.\nThese patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with\na lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal\nreasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation\nbranch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the\npatch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and\ndiffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables\nhigh-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training\nefficiency.

        "summary": "The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal\nestimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have\ndemonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on\ndata-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface\ninteraction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the\ndiscrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity\nin differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric\nerrors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby\nforcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper\nproposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for\nNormal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating\nphysics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based\nreprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into\nnormal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric\ninconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a\nlight-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale\ngeometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring\nmulti-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed\nwithin a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain\nnormal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.\nFurthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for\nself-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the\nreconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal\ndatasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across\nmultiple metrics.",

Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse\nrange of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,\nand split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,\naccelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated\nchips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile\npocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in\nrecent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map\ncontinuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the\nreconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as\npixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully\ndesigned neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and\nlighting effects.

These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without\nrelying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine\nlearning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized\nmodels that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient\ndescent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.",

However, current 3D scene design still\nrelies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated\nmethods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As\na result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing\nattention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced\nvision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for\ninteractive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate\ndiverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and\ncyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input\ndescriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK\n2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects\nrequired in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via\nstate-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial\nconstraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and\nphysically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments\ndemonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely\naligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming\nbaselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide\nediting capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout\nrefinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical\napplication of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually\nrich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.",

        "summary": "Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of\nsegmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin\nTransformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale\nrepresentations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.\nHowever, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high\ncomputational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense\nprediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,\nresource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been\nproposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin\nrequires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of\nconventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering\napproaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window\nconsistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a\nkey opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We\nintroduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,\nfine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal\ncoherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,\nTCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining\nfine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive\nevaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical\nvideo dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of\nexisting clustering-based methods.

        "summary": "Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant\nadvances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2\n(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains\nchallenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that\nimpedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel\nframework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing\nchallenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2\nintroduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation\nto improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and\npruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more\nefficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018\ndatasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,\nrespectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.\nExtensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal\naugmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for\nrobust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios.

In these scenarios, the sensor resolution\nis fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine\nstructure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency\nthat pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF\n(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.\nMZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom\nscalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:\nwide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and\nzoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a\nzoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement.

        "summary": "Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened\nconcerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or\nmisleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine\nunlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained\nmodels without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models\nfor targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated\ncontent, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this\nlimitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates\nUnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free\nGuidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide\nmodulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of\ndenoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts\ncontaining the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is\ncounterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model\ngoverns generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate\nthat UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive\npower of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both\nobject erasure and explicit content removal tasks.",

To address these\nchallenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding\nframework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy\nOptimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm.

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that\nseverely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in\nAD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due\nto the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep\nlearning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance\nimaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear\nrelationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their\nability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,\nwe propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane\nfusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial\nplanes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention\nmechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy\nfeatures. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction\nfrom multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural\ninformation. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible\nand accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise\nidentification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments\non the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior\nperformance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of\nright-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD\nprogression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.",

In this paper, we present a\nself-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for\nexpensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder\nusing a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to\nlearn both holistic and fine-grained representations.

The\nprogressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly\nrobust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving\nstructural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised\npretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)\nsupervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.\nExtensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method\noutperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the\neffectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER\nperformance.

        "summary": "We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion\nmodels. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict\nerroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel\nenvironmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies\nin quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data\ndistribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution\n(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions\nregarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a\nmechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model\nthat scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.\nWe update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to\nminimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the\nsource distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',\nor ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor\ndatasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an\naverage of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors.

        "summary": "Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural\nnetworks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client\nstores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This\nmakes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image\nclassification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal\nand privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is\nthe communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model\nupdates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this\npaper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses\nexplanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the\nsize of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages\nbackpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific\nimportance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the\ncentral server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,\nsubstantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label\nscene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene\nclassification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success\nof FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while\nenhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both\nunpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods.

However,\ngeospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial\nstructures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.\nMoreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and\noverlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and\ndiverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To\ntackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer\n(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for\nsemantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is\ndesigned to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar\ncategories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch\ndecoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for\nmultiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module\n(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to\nrealize refined semantic segmentation.

We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the\nprinciple that \"more is better,\" to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)\nemotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input\nmodalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge\nfrom large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)\ninformation. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a\nconsensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from\nthe agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a\ntwo-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble\ncombined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and\nbetter align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI\nchallenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,\nranking 2nd in the track.

To ensure the robustness of\n\\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content\nperception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It\nseparately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve\nhighly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.\nConcretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture\nsemantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract\nfine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a\ncontrollable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content\nalignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we\npropose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this\nend, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition\ncoefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal\nsemantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is\nfinally incorporated into \\textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the\noptimal plane bidirectionally.

        "summary": "Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open\nX-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks.\nHowever, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their\ntraining data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this\nlimited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the\nreliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.\nThrough comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two\nprimary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within\nindividual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across\nsub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the\ninherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically\ncomposed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied\nenvironments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into\ndataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the\ngeneralization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios\nwhere acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that\ncarefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce\nshortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving\ngeneralization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\\pi_0$, in\nboth simulation and real-world environments.

Past approaches to detect when a rank-one\nresult is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on\nthe similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled\nimages of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one\nresult is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and\nimages, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting\nthe ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.\nWe then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a\nrank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets\nand four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our\napproach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for\nprobes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and\nsunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that\nIn-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across\ndemographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate\nof whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby\nto reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted\ninvestigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep\nCNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our\nOut-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using\nadvanced margin-based loss functions.",

        "summary": "Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet\nexisting quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than\nthe quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --\nan inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social\ninformation that can be extracted and interpreted through established social\nscience theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images\nfrom 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's\ntaxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative\nexample of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or\ncomplemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression\nmodels, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian\ncounts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with\ncity-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with\nenvironmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived\nfrom individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban\nplanning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability\ntypes, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place\nattachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results\nprovide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer\nrelationships between specific types of social interactions and built\nenvironment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as\na scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling\ncross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant\ncities.",

        "summary": "Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy\nand timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying\ndisease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural\neffusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels\nbetween effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable\nmorphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and\ncomplex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic\ngaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive\nFusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested\nskip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature\nDisentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the\nfunctions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity\nand enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a\nBranch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically\nwith the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and\nfrequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.\nFurthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical\nadaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation\non 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet\nachieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results\noutperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and\nSwin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant\noptimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.",

        "summary": "With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes\nposes an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly\ndetection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level\nbehavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches\nbased on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time\nrequirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal\nbehavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.\nThis framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic\ndescriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses\nadjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term\ncontexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event\nsubjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal\nactivity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset\nthat provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,\nsummary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets\nand offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety\nscenarios.",

The potential of CNNs\nfor medical image analysis faces two limitations: they fail to process both\nlocal information and wide contextual data adequately, and do not provide\nexplainable AI (XAI) operations that doctors need to accept them in clinics.\nThe researcher developed the MammoFormer framework, which unites\ntransformer-based architecture with multi-feature enhancement components and\nXAI functionalities within one framework. Seven different architectures\nconsisting of CNNs, Vision Transformer, Swin Transformer, and ConvNext were\ntested alongside four enhancement techniques, including original images,\nnegative transformation, adaptive histogram equalization, and histogram of\noriented gradients. The MammoFormer framework addresses critical clinical\nadoption barriers of AI mammography systems through: (1) systematic\noptimization of transformer architectures via architecture-specific feature\nenhancement, achieving up to 13% performance improvement, (2) comprehensive\nexplainable AI integration providing multi-perspective diagnostic\ninterpretability, and (3) a clinically deployable ensemble system combining CNN\nreliability with transformer global context modeling.

To address this, we\npropose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that\nleverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial\nexamples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the\nshared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a\nparametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within\nadversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight\ndomain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using\nminimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.\nUltimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples\nthrough random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art\nmethods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific\ndatasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by\nSAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust\nfoundation models.",

The algorithms investigated include the classical linear\ntransformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep\nlearning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network\npre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated\nthat the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores\nfor all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit\nrates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed\nexceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other\ntasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from\nhigher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for\ndeep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent\nspace sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a\nlatent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false\nalarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,\nthe interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to\nphysical attributions.

        "summary": "Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end\nautonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a\nreliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental\nlimitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of\nhigh-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from\neffectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)\nrepresentations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for\nDriving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two\nprincipled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited\nhistogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar\nformat encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical\n3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba\nfusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with\na highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM\nleverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture\nlong-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the\nunique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the\nchallenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new\nstate-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.\nComprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,\ndemonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer\nin both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.",

First, we compute an\nisotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation\n(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label\ncustom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to\ngenerate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In\ncontrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,\nour approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes\ncompatible for pre- and intraoperative use.

        "summary": "Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two\nclosely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are\nclass-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the\nformer aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter\nfocuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the\nbackground in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory\nattributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these\ntwo tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.\nHowever, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to\nlearning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both\nsalient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint\nlearning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,\nassuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution\ncharacteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and\nvariances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal\namount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network\nstructure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at\na minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy\n(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set\nsizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and\nshortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a\npowerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to\nsimultaneously capture both ``salient\" and ``camouflaged\".

        "summary": "The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric\nfeatures remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While\nvision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware\nvisual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and\nreliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic\nsemantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware\nSemantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)\nAutomatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling\ncross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic\nanchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional\naffordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning\nbenchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's\neffectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,\nachieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a\nfiner-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a\nunified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in\nrobotic manipulation.",

In this study, we propose a practical framework for the\nfew-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging\ntasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a\nlarge-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,\nwe obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well\nacross tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a\nfrozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal\nsupervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a\nhybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE\nembeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both\nskull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited\nconditions.

However, conventional\naugmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model\nrobustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce\nDepth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural\ndepth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth\noffsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth\nperturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter\non two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on\nmodel stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare\nDepth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,\nanalyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss\nfunctions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods\nin absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and\ngeneralization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the\npotential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a\nfoundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies.

        "summary": "Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments\nmatching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While\nVision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they\noften struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group\nRelative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a\nreinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving\nstrong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it\nunsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and\nexpensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces\nprohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for\nreal-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient\nUnlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first\ntrained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only\na small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach\neliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and\nstorage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.\nUncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain\nknowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.\nURPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages\nthem to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across\nthese rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the\nmodel to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across\nsix cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few\nunlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.",

The underlying assumption for the\nsegmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be\nsummarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are\nsmooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is\na region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally\nproposed by Chan and Vese in \\cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image\ndata terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.\nGoldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \\cite{gold:bre} so\nthat their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman\nmethod to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation.
