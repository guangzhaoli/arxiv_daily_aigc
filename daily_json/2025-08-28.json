        "summary": "Language-driven image segmentation is a fundamental task in vision-language\nunderstanding, requiring models to segment regions of an image corresponding to\nnatural language expressions. Traditional methods approach this as a\ndiscriminative problem, assigning each pixel to foreground or background based\non semantic alignment. Recently, diffusion models have been introduced to this\ndomain, but existing approaches remain image-centric: they either (i) use image\ndiffusion models as visual feature extractors, (ii) synthesize segmentation\ndata via image generation to train discriminative models, or (iii) perform\ndiffusion inversion to extract attention cues from pre-trained image diffusion\nmodels-thereby treating segmentation as an auxiliary process. In this paper, we\npropose GS (Generative Segmentation), a novel framework that formulates\nsegmentation itself as a generative task via label diffusion. Instead of\ngenerating images conditioned on label maps and text, GS reverses the\ngenerative process: it directly generates segmentation masks from noise,\nconditioned on both the input image and the accompanying language description.\nThis paradigm makes label generation the primary modeling target, enabling\nend-to-end training with explicit control over spatial and semantic fidelity.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate GS on Panoptic\nNarrative Grounding (PNG), a representative and challenging benchmark for\nmultimodal segmentation that requires panoptic-level reasoning guided by\nnarrative captions. Experimental results show that GS significantly outperforms\nexisting discriminative and diffusion-based methods, setting a new\nstate-of-the-art for language-driven segmentation.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in motion generation show remarkable progress. However,\nseveral limitations remain: (1) Existing pose-guided character motion transfer\nmethods merely replicate motion without learning its style characteristics,\nresulting in inexpressive characters. (2) Motion style transfer methods rely\nheavily on motion capture data, which is difficult to obtain. (3) Generated\nmotions sometimes violate physical laws. To address these challenges, this\npaper pioneers a new task: Video-to-Video Motion Personalization. We propose a\nnovel framework, PersonaAnimator, which learns personalized motion patterns\ndirectly from unconstrained videos. This enables personalized motion transfer.\nTo support this task, we introduce PersonaVid, the first video-based\npersonalized motion dataset. It contains 20 motion content categories and 120\nmotion style categories. We further propose a Physics-aware Motion Style\nRegularization mechanism to enforce physical plausibility in the generated\nmotions.

The key to these systems is 3D reconstruction with high\ngeometrical fidelity. However, existing methods struggled under field\nconditions, especially with sparse and occluded views. This study developed a\ntwo-stage framework (DATR) for the reconstruction of apple trees from sparse\nviews. The first stage leverages onboard sensors and foundation models to\nsemi-automatically generate tree masks from complex field images. Tree masks\nare used to filter out background information in multi-modal data for the\nsingle-image-to-3D reconstruction at the second stage. This stage consists of a\ndiffusion model and a large reconstruction model for respective multi view and\nimplicit neural field generation. The training of the diffusion model and LRM\nwas achieved by using realistic synthetic apple trees generated by a Real2Sim\ndata generator. The framework was evaluated on both field and synthetic\ndatasets. The field dataset includes six apple trees with field-measured ground\ntruth, while the synthetic dataset featured structurally diverse trees.\nEvaluation results showed that our DATR framework outperformed existing 3D\nreconstruction methods across both datasets and achieved domain-trait\nestimation comparable to industrial-grade stationary laser scanners while\nimproving the throughput by $\\sim$360 times, demonstrating strong potential for\nscalable agricultural digital twin systems.",

To bridge this gap, we propose a unified\ntwo-stage predictive framework that jointly models action and visual future in\negocentric scenarios, conditioned on hand trajectories. In the first stage, we\nperform consecutive state modeling to process heterogeneous inputs (visual\nobservations, language, and action history) and explicitly predict future hand\ntrajectories.

Imbalanced multimodal\nlearning is one of the problems extensively studied in recent works and is\ntypically mitigated by modulating the learning of each modality.

We\nanalyze the cause of this issue and highlight a commonly overlooked problem:\noptimization bias within networks. To address this, we propose Adaptive\nIntra-Network Modulation (AIM) to improve balanced modality learning. AIM\naccounts for differences in optimization state across parameters and depths\nwithin the network during modulation, achieving balanced multimodal learning\nwithout hindering either dominant or weak modalities for the first time.\nSpecifically, AIM decouples the dominant modality's under-optimized parameters\ninto Auxiliary Blocks and encourages reliance on these performance-degraded\nblocks for joint training with weaker modalities. This approach effectively\nprevents suppression of weaker modalities while enabling targeted optimization\nof under-optimized parameters to improve the dominant modality. Additionally,\nAIM assesses modality imbalance level across network depths and adaptively\nadjusts modulation strength at each depth.

Secondly, the proposed model utilizes wavelet\ntransforms to decompose images into multiple frequency subbands, allowing the\nnetwork to focus on both global and local features while preserving structural\ndetails. By progressively reconstructing high-resolution images through\nhierarchical processing, the network reduces computational complexity without\nsacrificing performance. The multi-level decomposition strategy enables the\nnetwork to capture fine-grained information in lowfrequency components while\nenhancing high-frequency textures. Through extensive experimentation, we\nconfirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our WaveHiT-SR.

($ii$) Existing frame-by-frame optimization methods\ntypically optimize frames independently, neglecting spatial-temporal\ncorrelations between consecutive frames and leading to computationally\ninefficient solutions. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose\na novel high-speed full-color video CGH generation scheme. First, we introduce\nSpectrum-Guided Depth Division Multiplexing (SGDDM), which optimizes phase\ndistributions via frequency modulation, enabling high-fidelity full-color\ndisplay at high frame rates. Second, we present HoloMamba, a lightweight\nasymmetric Mamba-Unet architecture that explicitly models spatial-temporal\ncorrelations across video sequences to enhance reconstruction quality and\ncomputational efficiency. Extensive simulated and real-world experiments\ndemonstrate that SGDDM achieves high-fidelity full-color display without\ncompromise in frame rate, while HoloMamba generates FHD (1080p) full-color\nholographic video at over 260 FPS, more than 2.6$\\times$ faster than the prior\nstate-of-the-art Divide-Conquer-and-Merge Strategy.",

        "summary": "While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong performance on\nsingle-video tasks (e.g., video question answering), their ability across\nmultiple videos remains critically underexplored. However, this capability is\nessential for real-world applications, including multi-camera surveillance and\ncross-video procedural learning. To bridge this gap, we present CVBench, the\nfirst comprehensive benchmark designed to assess cross-video relational\nreasoning rigorously. CVBench comprises 1,000 question-answer pairs spanning\nthree hierarchical tiers: cross-video object association (identifying shared\nentities), cross-video event association (linking temporal or causal event\nchains), and cross-video complex reasoning (integrating commonsense and domain\nknowledge). Built from five domain-diverse video clusters (e.g., sports, life\nrecords), the benchmark challenges models to synthesise information across\ndynamic visual contexts. Extensive evaluation of 10+ leading MLLMs (including\nGPT-4o, Gemini-2.0-flash, Qwen2.5-VL) under zero-shot or chain-of-thought\nprompting paradigms. Key findings reveal stark performance gaps: even top\nmodels, such as GPT-4o, achieve only 60% accuracy on causal reasoning tasks,\ncompared to the 91% accuracy of human performance. Crucially, our analysis\nreveals fundamental bottlenecks inherent in current MLLM architectures, notably\ndeficient inter-video context retention and poor disambiguation of overlapping\nentities. CVBench establishes a rigorous framework for diagnosing and advancing\nmulti-video reasoning, offering architectural insights for next-generation\nMLLMs.The data and evaluation code are available at\nhttps://github.com/Hokhim2/CVBench.",

However, prevailing VLA decoders\neither generate actions autoregressively in a fixed left-to-right order or\nattach continuous diffusion or flow matching heads outside the backbone,\ndemanding specialized training and iterative sampling that hinder a unified,\nscalable architecture. We present Discrete Diffusion VLA, a single-transformer\npolicy that models discretized action chunks with discrete diffusion and is\ntrained with the same cross-entropy objective as the VLM backbone. The design\nretains diffusion's progressive refinement paradigm while remaining natively\ncompatible with the discrete token interface of VLMs. Our method achieves an\nadaptive decoding order that resolves easy action elements before harder ones\nand uses secondary remasking to revisit uncertain predictions across refinement\nrounds, which improves consistency and enables robust error correction. This\nunified decoder preserves pretrained vision language priors, supports parallel\ndecoding, breaks the autoregressive bottleneck, and reduces the number of\nfunction evaluations. Discrete Diffusion VLA achieves 96.3% avg.

This work addresses Incremental Test Time Adaptation of Vision\nLanguage Models, tackling scenarios where unseen classes and unseen domains\ncontinuously appear during testing. Unlike traditional Test Time Adaptation\napproaches, where the test stream comes only from a predefined set of classes,\nour framework allows models to adapt simultaneously to both covariate and label\nshifts, actively incorporating new classes as they emerge. Towards this goal,\nwe establish a new benchmark for ITTA, integrating single image TTA methods for\nVLMs with active labeling techniques that query an oracle for samples\npotentially representing unseen classes during test time.

        "summary": "Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve high accuracy but often\nrely on purely global, gradient-based optimisation, which can lead to\noverfitting, redundant filters, and reduced interpretability. To address these\nlimitations, we propose NM-Hebb, a two-phase training framework that integrates\nneuro-inspired local plasticity with distance-aware supervision. Phase 1\nextends standard supervised training by jointly optimising a cross-entropy\nobjective with two biologically inspired mechanisms: (i) a Hebbian regulariser\nthat aligns the spatial mean of activations with the mean of the corresponding\nconvolutional filter weights, encouraging structured, reusable primitives; and\n(ii) a learnable neuromodulator that gates an elastic-weight-style\nconsolidation loss, preserving beneficial parameters without freezing the\nnetwork. Phase 2 fine-tunes the backbone with a pairwise metric-learning loss,\nexplicitly compressing intra-class distances and enlarging inter-class margins\nin the embedding space. Evaluated on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet\nacross five backbones (ResNet-18, VGG-11, MobileNet-v2, EfficientNet-V2,\nDenseNet-121), NM-Hebb achieves consistent gains over baseline and other\nmethods: Top-1 accuracy improves by +2.0-10.0 pp (CIFAR-10), +2.0-9.0 pp\n(CIFAR-100), and up to +4.3-8.9 pp (TinyImageNet), with Normalised Mutual\nInformation (NMI) increased by up to +0.15. Qualitative visualisations and\nfilter-level analyses further confirm that NM-Hebb produces more structured and\nselective features, yielding tighter and more interpretable class clusters.\nOverall, coupling local Hebbian plasticity with metric-based fine-tuning yields\nCNNs that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable, offering\npractical benefits for resource-constrained and safety-critical AI deployments.",

        "summary": "With the introduction of vehicles with autonomous capabilities on public\nroads, predicting pedestrian crossing intention has emerged as an active area\nof research. The task of predicting pedestrian crossing intention involves\ndetermining whether pedestrians in the scene are likely to cross the road or\nnot. In this work, we propose TrajFusionNet, a novel transformer-based model\nthat combines future pedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed predictions as\npriors for predicting crossing intention. TrajFusionNet comprises two branches:\na Sequence Attention Module (SAM) and a Visual Attention Module (VAM). The SAM\nbranch learns from a sequential representation of the observed and predicted\npedestrian trajectory and vehicle speed. Complementarily, the VAM branch\nenables learning from a visual representation of the predicted pedestrian\ntrajectory by overlaying predicted pedestrian bounding boxes onto scene images.\nBy utilizing a small number of lightweight modalities, TrajFusionNet achieves\nthe lowest total inference time (including model runtime and data\npreprocessing) among current state-of-the-art approaches. In terms of\nperformance, it achieves state-of-the-art results across the three most\ncommonly used datasets for pedestrian crossing intention prediction.",

        "summary": "Machine vision systems (MVS) are intrinsically vulnerable to performance\ndegradation under adverse visual conditions. To address this, we propose a\nmachine-centric image quality assessment (MIQA) framework that quantifies the\nimpact of image degradations on MVS performance. We establish an MIQA paradigm\nencompassing the end-to-end assessment workflow. To support this, we construct\na machine-centric image quality database (MIQD-2.5M), comprising 2.5 million\nsamples that capture distinctive degradation responses in both consistency and\naccuracy metrics, spanning 75 vision models, 250 degradation types, and three\nrepresentative vision tasks. We further propose a region-aware MIQA (RA-MIQA)\nmodel to evaluate MVS visual quality through fine-grained spatial degradation\nanalysis. Extensive experiments benchmark the proposed RA-MIQA against seven\nhuman visual system (HVS)-based IQA metrics and five retrained classical\nbackbones. Results demonstrate RA-MIQA's superior performance in multiple\ndimensions, e.g., achieving SRCC gains of 13.56% on consistency and 13.37% on\naccuracy for image classification, while also revealing task-specific\ndegradation sensitivities. Critically, HVS-based metrics prove inadequate for\nMVS quality prediction, while even specialized MIQA models struggle with\nbackground degradations, accuracy-oriented estimation, and subtle distortions.\nThis study can advance MVS reliability and establish foundations for\nmachine-centric image processing and optimization.

        "summary": "Automated segmentation of the fetal head in ultrasound images is critical for\nprenatal monitoring. However, achieving robust segmentation remains challenging\ndue to the poor quality of ultrasound images and the lack of annotated data.\nSemi-supervised methods alleviate the lack of annotated data but struggle with\nthe unique characteristics of fetal head ultrasound images, making it\nchallenging to generate reliable pseudo-labels and enforce effective\nconsistency regularization constraints. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel semi-supervised framework, ERSR, for fetal head ultrasound segmentation.\nOur framework consists of the dual-scoring adaptive filtering strategy, the\nellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement, and the symmetry-based multiple\nconsistency regularization. The dual-scoring adaptive filtering strategy uses\nboundary consistency and contour regularity criteria to evaluate and filter\nteacher outputs. The ellipse-constrained pseudo-label refinement refines these\nfiltered outputs by fitting least-squares ellipses, which strengthens pixels\nnear the center of the fitted ellipse and suppresses noise simultaneously. The\nsymmetry-based multiple consistency regularization enforces multi-level\nconsistency across perturbed images, symmetric regions, and between original\npredictions and pseudo-labels, enabling the model to capture robust and stable\nshape representations. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two\nbenchmarks. On the HC18 dataset, it reaches Dice scores of 92.05% and 95.36%\nwith 10% and 20% labeled data, respectively.

FastAvatar's core is a Large Gaussian Reconstruction Transformer\nfeaturing three key designs: First, a variant VGGT-style transformer\narchitecture aggregating multi-frame cues while injecting initial 3D prompt to\npredict an aggregatable canonical 3DGS representation; Second, multi-granular\nguidance encoding (camera pose, FLAME expression, head pose) mitigating\nanimation-induced misalignment for variable-length inputs; Third, incremental\nGaussian aggregation via landmark tracking and sliced fusion losses.\nIntegrating these features, FastAvatar enables incremental reconstruction,\ni.e., improving quality with more observations, unlike prior work wasting input\ndata. This yields a quality-speed-tunable paradigm for highly usable avatar\nmodeling. Extensive experiments show that FastAvatar has higher quality and\nhighly competitive speed compared to existing methods.",

        "summary": "The rapid advance of deep generative models such as GANs and diffusion\nnetworks now produces images that are virtually indistinguishable from genuine\nphotographs, undermining media forensics and biometric security. Supervised\ndetectors quickly lose effectiveness on unseen generators or after adversarial\npost-processing, while existing unsupervised methods that rely on low-level\nstatistical cues remain fragile. We introduce a physics-inspired,\nmodel-agnostic detector that treats synthetic-image identification as a\ncommunity-detection problem on a sparse weighted graph. Image features are\nfirst extracted with pretrained CNNs and reduced to 32 dimensions, each feature\nvector becomes a node of a Multi-Edge Type QC-LDPC graph. Pairwise similarities\nare transformed into edge couplings calibrated at the Nishimori temperature,\nproducing a Random Bond Ising Model (RBIM) whose Bethe-Hessian spectrum\nexhibits a characteristic gap when genuine community structure (real images) is\npresent. Synthetic images violate the Nishimori symmetry and therefore lack\nsuch gaps. We validate the approach on binary tasks cat versus dog and male\nversus female using real photos from Flickr-Faces-HQ and CelebA and synthetic\ncounterparts generated by GANs and diffusion models. Without any labeled\nsynthetic data or retraining of the feature extractor, the detector achieves\nover 94% accuracy. Spectral analysis shows multiple well separated gaps for\nreal image sets and a collapsed spectrum for generated ones. Our contributions\nare threefold: a novel LDPC graph construction that embeds deep image features,\nan analytical link between Nishimori temperature RBIM and the Bethe-Hessian\nspectrum providing a Bayes optimal detection criterion; and a practical,\nunsupervised synthetic image detector robust to new generative architectures.\nFuture work will extend the framework to video streams and multi-class anomaly\ndetection.",

However, the\ngeometric ambiguity inherent in a single 2D image and the scarcity of 3D human\ntraining data are the main obstacles limiting progress in this field. To\naddress these issues, current methods employ prior geometric estimation\nnetworks to derive various human geometric forms, such as the SMPL model and\nnormal maps. However, they struggle to integrate these modalities effectively,\nleading to view inconsistencies, such as facial distortions. To this end, we\npropose a two-process 3D human reconstruction framework, SAT, which seamlessly\nlearns various prior geometries in a unified manner and reconstructs\nhigh-quality textured 3D avatars as the final output. To further facilitate\ngeometry learning, we introduce a Supervisor Feature Regularization module.

In this paper, we propose a novel\nfrequency-aware self-supervised learning method for UWF image enhancement.

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from visual hallucinations, saying\nthings that are not actually in the image, and language shortcuts, where they\nskip the visual part and just rely on text priors. These issues arise because\nmost post-training methods for VLMs rely on simple verifiable answer matching\nand supervise only final outputs, leaving intermediate visual reasoning without\nexplicit guidance. As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often\nlearn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To\nmitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human\nannotations or distilled labels from external large models. However, human\nannotations are labor-intensive and costly, and because external signals cannot\nadapt to the evolving policy, they cause distributional shifts that can lead to\nreward hacking. In this paper, we introduce Vision-SR1, a self-rewarding method\nthat improves visual reasoning without relying on external visual supervisions\nvia reinforcement learning. Vision-SR1 decomposes VLM reasoning into two\nstages: visual perception and language reasoning. The model is first prompted\nto produce self-contained visual perceptions that are sufficient to answer the\nquestion without referring back the input image. To validate this\nself-containment, the same VLM model is then re-prompted to perform language\nreasoning using only the generated perception as input to compute reward. This\nself-reward is combined with supervision on final outputs, providing a balanced\ntraining signal that strengthens both visual perception and language reasoning.\nOur experiments demonstrate that Vision-SR1 improves visual reasoning,\nmitigates visual hallucinations, and reduces reliance on language shortcuts\nacross diverse vision-language tasks.",

Remarkably, our fine-tuned ODAL-LLaVA model\nachieves an ODAL$_{score}$ of 89%, representing a 71% improvement over its\nbaseline performance and outperforming GPT-4o by nearly 20%. Furthermore, the\nfine-tuned model maintains high detection accuracy while significantly reducing\nhallucinations, achieving an ODAL$_{SNR}$ three times higher than GPT-4o.",

We present\nVideo-LevelGauge, a dedicated benchmark designed to systematically assess\npositional bias in LVLMs. We employ standardized probes and customized\ncontextual setups, allowing flexible control over context length, probe\nposition, and contextual types to simulate diverse real-world scenarios. In\naddition, we introduce a comprehensive analysis method that combines\nstatistical measures with morphological pattern recognition to characterize\nbias. Our benchmark comprises 438 manually curated videos spanning multiple\ntypes, yielding 1,177 high-quality multiple-choice questions and 120 open-ended\nquestions, validated for their effectiveness in exposing positional bias. Based\non these, we evaluate 27 state-of-the-art LVLMs, including both commercial and\nopen-source models. Our findings reveal significant positional biases in many\nleading open-source models, typically exhibiting head or neighbor-content\npreferences. In contrast, commercial models such as Gemini2.5-Pro show\nimpressive, consistent performance across entire video sequences.

While deep learning-based\nmethods have shown remarkable success, their reliance on specific noise\ndistributions limits generalization to unseen noise types and levels. Existing\napproaches attempt to address this with extensive training data and high\ncomputational resources but they still suffer from overfitting. To address\nthese issues, we conduct image denoising by utilizing dynamically generated\nkernels via efficient operations. This approach helps prevent overfitting and\nimproves resilience to unseen noise. Specifically, our method leverages a\nFeature Extraction Module for robust noise-invariant features, Global\nStatistics and Local Correlation Modules to capture comprehensive noise\ncharacteristics and structural correlations. The Kernel Prediction Module then\nemploys these cues to produce pixel-wise varying kernels adapted to local\nstructures, which are then applied iteratively for denoising. This ensures both\nefficiency and superior restoration quality. Despite being trained on\nsingle-level Gaussian noise, our compact model (~ 0.04 M) excels across diverse\nnoise types and levels, demonstrating the promise of iterative dynamic\nfiltering for practical image denoising.",

        "summary": "Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) focuses on training a model\nusing labeled data from a source domain, with the goal of achieving robust\ngeneralization to unseen target domains during inference. A common approach to\nimprove generalization is to augment the source domain with synthetic data\ngenerated by diffusion models (DMs). However, the generated images often\ncontain structural or semantic defects due to training imperfections. Training\nsegmentation models with such flawed data can lead to performance degradation\nand error accumulation. To address this issue, we propose to integrate inverse\nevolution layers (IELs) into the generative process. IELs are designed to\nhighlight spatial discontinuities and semantic inconsistencies using\nLaplacian-based priors, enabling more effective filtering of undesirable\ngenerative patterns. Based on this mechanism, we introduce IELDM, an enhanced\ndiffusion-based data augmentation framework that can produce higher-quality\nimages. Furthermore, we observe that the defect-suppression capability of IELs\ncan also benefit the segmentation network by suppressing artifact propagation.\nBased on this insight, we embed IELs into the decoder of the DGSS model and\npropose IELFormer to strengthen generalization capability in cross-domain\nscenarios. To further strengthen the model's semantic consistency across\nscales, IELFormer incorporates a multi-scale frequency fusion (MFF) module,\nwhich performs frequency-domain analysis to achieve structured integration of\nmulti-resolution features, thereby improving cross-scale coherence. Extensive\nexperiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves\nsuperior generalization performance compared to existing methods.",

To address these limitations, we propose MPAMatch - a novel\nsegmentation framework that performs pixel-level contrastive learning under a\nmultimodal prototype-guided supervision paradigm. The core innovation of\nMPAMatch lies in the dual contrastive learning scheme between image prototypes\nand pixel labels, and between text prototypes and pixel labels, providing\nsupervision at both structural and semantic levels. This coarse-to-fine\nsupervisory strategy not only enhances the discriminative capability on\nunlabeled samples but also introduces the text prototype supervision into\nsegmentation for the first time, significantly improving semantic boundary\nmodeling. In addition, we reconstruct the classic segmentation architecture\n(TransUNet) by replacing its ViT backbone with a pathology-pretrained\nfoundation model (Uni), enabling more effective extraction of\npathology-relevant features.

        "summary": "Motion generation is essential for animating virtual characters and embodied\nagents. While recent text-driven methods have made significant strides, they\noften struggle with achieving precise alignment between linguistic descriptions\nand motion semantics, as well as with the inefficiencies of slow, multi-step\ninference. To address these issues, we introduce TMR++ Aligned Preference\nOptimization (TAPO), an innovative framework that aligns subtle motion\nvariations with textual modifiers and incorporates iterative adjustments to\nreinforce semantic grounding. To further enable real-time synthesis, we propose\nMotionFLUX, a high-speed generation framework based on deterministic rectified\nflow matching. Unlike traditional diffusion models, which require hundreds of\ndenoising steps, MotionFLUX constructs optimal transport paths between noise\ndistributions and motion spaces, facilitating real-time synthesis. The\nlinearized probability paths reduce the need for multi-step sampling typical of\nsequential methods, significantly accelerating inference time without\nsacrificing motion quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, together,\nTAPO and MotionFLUX form a unified system that outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches in both semantic consistency and motion quality, while also\naccelerating generation speed. The code and pretrained models will be released.",

        "summary": "Origin-Destination (OD) flow matrices are essential for urban mobility\nanalysis, underpinning applications in traffic forecasting, infrastructure\nplanning, and policy design. However, existing methods suffer from two critical\nlimitations: (1) reliance on auxiliary features (e.g., Points of Interest,\nsocioeconomic statistics) that are costly to collect and have limited spatial\ncoverage; and (2) sensitivity to spatial topology, where minor index reordering\nof urban regions (e.g., census tract relabeling) disrupts structural coherence\nin generated flows. To address these challenges, we propose Sat2Flow, a latent\nstructure-aware diffusion-based framework that generates structurally coherent\nOD flows using solely satellite imagery as input. Our approach introduces a\nmulti-kernel encoder to capture diverse regional interactions and employs a\npermutation-aware diffusion process that aligns latent representations across\ndifferent regional orderings. Through a joint contrastive training objective\nthat bridges satellite-derived features with OD patterns, combined with\nequivariant diffusion training that enforces structural consistency, Sat2Flow\nensures topological robustness under arbitrary regional reindexing.\nExperimental results on real-world urban datasets demonstrate that Sat2Flow\noutperforms both physics-based and data-driven baselines in numerical accuracy\nwhile preserving empirical distributions and spatial structures under index\npermutations. Sat2Flow offers a globally scalable solution for OD flow\ngeneration in data-scarce urban environments, eliminating region-specific\nauxiliary data dependencies while maintaining structural invariance for robust\nmobility modeling.",

Existing smartphone\nagents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved\nremarkable performance in automating different tasks.

To gain a thorough understanding of the\nprivacy awareness of these agents, we present the first large-scale benchmark\nencompassing 7,138 scenarios to the best of our knowledge. In addition, for\nprivacy context in scenarios, we annotate its type (e.g., Account Credentials),\nsensitivity level, and location. We then carefully benchmark seven available\nmainstream smartphone agents. Our results demonstrate that almost all\nbenchmarked agents show unsatisfying privacy awareness (RA), with performance\nremaining below 60% even with explicit hints. Overall, closed-source agents\nshow better privacy ability than open-source ones, and Gemini 2.0-flash\nachieves the best, achieving an RA of 67%. We also find that the agents'\nprivacy detection capability is highly related to scenario sensitivity level,\ni.e., the scenario with a higher sensitivity level is typically more\nidentifiable.

        "summary": "Gas leaks pose serious threats to human health and contribute significantly\nto atmospheric pollution, drawing increasing public concern. However, the lack\nof effective detection methods hampers timely and accurate identification of\ngas leaks. While some vision-based techniques leverage infrared videos for leak\ndetection, the blurry and non-rigid nature of gas clouds often limits their\neffectiveness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called\nJoint Vision-Language Gas leak Segmentation (JVLGS), which integrates the\ncomplementary strengths of visual and textual modalities to enhance gas leak\nrepresentation and segmentation. Recognizing that gas leaks are sporadic and\nmany video frames may contain no leak at all, our method incorporates a\npost-processing step to reduce false positives caused by noise and non-target\nobjects, an issue that affects many existing approaches. Extensive experiments\nconducted across diverse scenarios show that JVLGS significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art gas leak segmentation methods. We evaluate our model under\nboth supervised and few-shot learning settings, and it consistently achieves\nstrong performance in both, whereas competing methods tend to perform well in\nonly one setting or poorly in both.

Data\nwere obtained from one match at the 2022 Qatar Federation Internationale de\nFootball Association (FIFA) World Cup. Tactical, programme and camera 1 feeds\nwere used. Three commercial tracking providers that use computer-vision and AI\nparticipated. Providers analysed instantaneous position (x, y coordinates) and\nspeed (m\\,s^{-1}) of each player. Their data were compared with a\nhigh-definition multi-camera tracking system (TRACAB Gen 5). Root mean square\nerror (RMSE) and mean bias were calculated. Position RMSE ranged from 1.68 to\n16.39 m, while speed RMSE ranged from 0.34 to 2.38 m\\,s^{-1}. Total match\ndistance mean bias ranged from -1745 m (-21.8%) to 1945 m (24.3%) across\nproviders. Computer-vision and AI player tracking software offer the ability to\ntrack players with fair precision when players are detected by the software.\nProviders should use a tactical feed when tracking position and speed, which\nwill maximise player detection, improving accuracy.

However, existing approaches are\ninherently coarse-grained, lacking the necessary precision for granular\nknowledge extraction and the aggregation efficiency required to fuse knowledge\nfrom either a large number of source models or those with high parameter\ncounts. We address these limitations by leveraging Singular Value Decomposition\n(SVD) to first decompose each source model into its elementary, rank-one\ncomponents. A subsequent aggregation stage then selects only the most salient\ncomponents from all sources, thereby overcoming the previous efficiency and\nprecision limitations. To best preserve and leverage the synthesized knowledge\nbase, our method adapts to the target task by fine-tuning only the principal\nsingular values of the merged matrix. In essence, this process only\nrecalibrates the importance of top SVD components.

Developing new AL\nmethods requires training multiple detectors across iterations to compare\nagainst existing approaches.

We\nintroduce object-based set similarity ($\\mathrm{OSS}$), a metric that addresses\nthese challenges. $\\mathrm{OSS}$ (1) quantifies AL method effectiveness without\nrequiring detector training by measuring similarity between training sets and\ntarget domains using object-level features. This enables the elimination of\nineffective AL methods before training. Furthermore, $\\mathrm{OSS}$ (2) enables\nthe selection of representative validation sets for robust evaluation. We\nvalidate our similarity-based approach on three autonomous driving datasets\n(KITTI, BDD100K, CODA) using uncertainty-based AL methods as a case study with\ntwo detector architectures (EfficientDet, YOLOv3). This work is the first to\nunify AL training and evaluation strategies in object detection based on object\nsimilarity. $\\mathrm{OSS}$ is detector-agnostic, requires only labeled object\ncrops, and integrates with existing AL pipelines.

        "summary": "Deep neural networks often produce overconfident predictions, undermining\ntheir reliability in safety-critical applications. This miscalibration is\nfurther exacerbated under distribution shift, where test data deviates from the\ntraining distribution due to environmental or acquisition changes. While\nexisting approaches improve calibration through training-time regularization or\npost-hoc adjustment, their reliance on access to or simulation of target\ndomains limits their practicality in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we\npropose a novel calibration framework that operates without access to target\ndomain information. From a frequency-domain perspective, we identify that\ndistribution shifts often distort high-frequency visual cues exploited by deep\nmodels, and introduce a low-frequency filtering strategy to encourage reliance\non domain-invariant features. However, such information loss may degrade\nIn-Distribution (ID) calibration performance. Therefore, we further propose a\ngradient-based rectification mechanism that enforces ID calibration as a hard\nconstraint during optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world shifted\ndatasets, including CIFAR-10/100-C and WILDS, demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly improves calibration under distribution shift while maintaining\nstrong in-distribution performance.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative\ndisorders worldwide. As it progresses, it leads to the deterioration of\ncognitive functions. Since AD is irreversible, early diagnosis is crucial for\nmanaging its progression. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) represents an\nintermediate stage between Cognitively Normal (CN) individuals and those with\nAD, and is considered a transitional phase from normal cognition to Alzheimer's\ndisease. Diagnosing MCI is particularly challenging due to the subtle\ndifferences between adjacent diagnostic categories. In this study, we propose\nEffNetViTLoRA, a generalized end-to-end model for AD diagnosis using the whole\nAlzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(MRI) dataset. Our model integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a\nVision Transformer (ViT) to capture both local and global features from MRI\nimages. Unlike previous studies that rely on limited subsets of data, our\napproach is trained on the full T1-weighted MRI dataset from ADNI, resulting in\na more robust and unbiased model. This comprehensive methodology enhances the\nmodel's clinical reliability. Furthermore, fine-tuning large pretrained models\noften yields suboptimal results when source and target dataset domains differ.\nTo address this, we incorporate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to effectively adapt\nthe pretrained ViT model to our target domain. This method enables efficient\nknowledge transfer and reduces the risk of overfitting. Our model achieves a\nclassification accuracy of 92.52% and an F1-score of 92.76% across three\ndiagnostic categories: AD, MCI, and CN for full ADNI dataset.",

This is a critical limitation given the\nscarcity of high-quality data in scientific domains. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce CODA, a novel and trainable compositional framework\nthat integrates a generalist planner (Cerebrum) with a specialist executor\n(Cerebellum), trained via a dedicated two-stage pipeline.

        "summary": "Recent advances in text-to-audio (TTA) generation excel at synthesizing short\naudio clips but struggle with long-form narrative audio, which requires\ntemporal coherence and compositional reasoning. To address this gap, we propose\nAudioStory, a unified framework that integrates large language models (LLMs)\nwith TTA systems to generate structured, long-form audio narratives. AudioStory\npossesses strong instruction-following reasoning generation capabilities. It\nemploys LLMs to decompose complex narrative queries into temporally ordered\nsub-tasks with contextual cues, enabling coherent scene transitions and\nemotional tone consistency. AudioStory has two appealing features: (1)\nDecoupled bridging mechanism: AudioStory disentangles LLM-diffuser\ncollaboration into two specialized components, i.e., a bridging query for\nintra-event semantic alignment and a residual query for cross-event coherence\npreservation. (2) End-to-end training: By unifying instruction comprehension\nand audio generation within a single end-to-end framework, AudioStory\neliminates the need for modular training pipelines while enhancing synergy\nbetween components. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark AudioStory-10K,\nencompassing diverse domains such as animated soundscapes and natural sound\nnarratives.

        "summary": "Cross-view geo-localization is a critical task for UAV navigation, event\ndetection, and aerial surveying, as it enables matching between drone-captured\nand satellite imagery. Most existing approaches embed multi-modal data into a\njoint feature space to maximize the similarity of paired images. However, these\nmethods typically assume perfect alignment of image pairs during training,\nwhich rarely holds true in real-world scenarios. In practice, factors such as\nurban canyon effects, electromagnetic interference, and adverse weather\nfrequently induce GPS drift, resulting in systematic alignment shifts where\nonly partial correspondences exist between pairs. Despite its prevalence, this\nsource of noisy correspondence has received limited attention in current\nresearch. In this paper, we formally introduce and address the Noisy\nCorrespondence on Cross-View Geo-Localization (NC-CVGL) problem, aiming to\nbridge the gap between idealized benchmarks and practical applications. To this\nend, we propose PAUL (Partition and Augmentation by Uncertainty Learning), a\nnovel framework that partitions and augments training data based on estimated\ndata uncertainty through uncertainty-aware co-augmentation and evidential\nco-training. Specifically, PAUL selectively augments regions with high\ncorrespondence confidence and utilizes uncertainty estimation to refine feature\nlearning, effectively suppressing noise from misaligned pairs. Distinct from\ntraditional filtering or label correction, PAUL leverages both data uncertainty\nand loss discrepancy for targeted partitioning and augmentation, thus providing\nrobust supervision for noisy samples. Comprehensive experiments validate the\neffectiveness of individual components in PAUL,which consistently achieves\nsuperior performance over other competitive noisy-correspondence-driven methods\nin various noise ratios.",

In particular,\nOpenM3D is a single-stage detector adapting the 2D-induced voxel features from\nthe ImGeoNet model. To support OV, it is jointly trained with a class-agnostic\n3D localization loss requiring high-quality 3D pseudo boxes and a\nvoxel-semantic alignment loss requiring diverse pre-trained CLIP features.

Its core is a dynamic score-based partitioning strategy that\ndistinguishes between high- and low-dynamic 3D Gaussians. For high-dynamic 3D\nGaussians, we recursively partition them temporally and duplicate their\ndeformation networks for each new temporal segment, enabling specialized\nmodeling to capture intricate motion details. Concurrently, low-dynamic 3DGs\nare treated as static to reduce computational costs. However, this temporal\npartitioning strategy for high-dynamic 3DGs can introduce visual\ndiscontinuities across frames at the partition boundaries. To address this, we\nintroduce a cross-frame consistency loss, which not only ensures visual\ncontinuity but also further enhances rendering quality. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MAPo achieves superior rendering quality compared to baselines\nwhile maintaining comparable computational costs, particularly in regions with\ncomplex or rapid motions.",

To support scalable,\nautomated pollinator monitoring, we introduce BuzzSet, a new large-scale\ndataset of high-resolution pollinator images collected in real agricultural\nfield conditions. BuzzSet contains 7856 manually verified and labeled images,\nwith over 8000 annotated instances across three classes: honeybees, bumblebees,\nand unidentified insects. Initial annotations were generated using a YOLOv12\nmodel trained on external data and refined via human verification using\nopen-source labeling tools. All images were preprocessed into 256~$\\times$~256\ntiles to improve the detection of small insects. We provide strong baselines\nusing the RF-DETR transformer-based object detector. The model achieves high\nF1-scores of 0.94 and 0.92 for honeybee and bumblebee classes, respectively,\nwith confusion matrix results showing minimal misclassification between these\ncategories. The unidentified class remains more challenging due to label\nambiguity and lower sample frequency, yet still contributes useful insights for\nrobustness evaluation.

This study tackles both issues through a\ndiagnostic-driven, semi-supervised framework. Using a unique dataset of\napproximately 975 labeled and 10,000 unlabeled images of Guinea Grass in\nsugarcane, we first establish strong supervised baselines for classification\n(ResNet) and detection (YOLO, RF-DETR), achieving F1 scores up to 0.90 and\nmAP50 scores exceeding 0.82. Crucially, this foundational analysis, aided by\ninterpretability tools, uncovered a pervasive \"shadow bias,\" where models\nlearned to misidentify shadows as vegetation. This diagnostic insight motivated\nour primary contribution: a semi-supervised pipeline that leverages unlabeled\ndata to enhance model robustness. By training models on a more diverse set of\nvisual information through pseudo-labeling, this framework not only helps\nmitigate the shadow bias but also provides a tangible boost in recall, a\ncritical metric for minimizing weed escapes in automated spraying systems.

Our approach models object-level risk and\ncontext through a semantic graph-based propagation algorithm. Each object is\nrepresented as a node with an associated risk score, and risk propagates\nasymmetrically from high-risk to low-risk objects based on spatial proximity\nand accident relationship. This enables the robot to infer potential hazards\neven when they are not explicitly visible or labeled.

At inference, we define a novel Action Dynamics Metric\n(ADM), computed directly from low-dimensional ASTGCN embeddings, which detects\nmotion boundaries by identifying inflection points in its curvature profile.\nOur method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 82.66% and average\nlocalization latency of 29.09 ms on the DSV Diving dataset, matching\nstate-of-the-art supervised performance while maintaining computational\nefficiency. Furthermore, it generalizes robustly to unseen, in-the-wild diving\nfootage without retraining, demonstrating its practical applicability for\nlightweight, real-time action analysis systems in embedded or dynamic\nenvironments.",

        "title": "Beyond BEV: Optimizing Point-Level Tokens for Collaborative Perception",
        "summary": "Collaborative perception allows agents to enhance their perceptual\ncapabilities by exchanging intermediate features. Existing methods typically\norganize these intermediate features as 2D bird's-eye-view (BEV)\nrepresentations, which discard critical fine-grained 3D structural cues\nessential for accurate object recognition and localization. To this end, we\nfirst introduce point-level tokens as intermediate representations for\ncollaborative perception. However, point-cloud data are inherently unordered,\nmassive, and position-sensitive, making it challenging to produce compact and\naligned point-level token sequences that preserve detailed structural\ninformation. Therefore, we present CoPLOT, a novel Collaborative perception\nframework that utilizes Point-Level Optimized Tokens. It incorporates a\npoint-native processing pipeline, including token reordering, sequence\nmodeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment. A semantic-aware token reordering\nmodule generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and\ntoken-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model\ncaptures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral\ndomains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background\nclutter. Lastly, a neighbor-to-ego alignment module applies a closed-loop\nprocess, combining global agent-level correction with local token-level\nrefinement to mitigate localization noise. Extensive experiments on both\nsimulated and real-world datasets show that CoPLOT outperforms state-of-the-art\nmodels, with even lower communication and computation overhead.

        "summary": "Long-tailed visual recognition is challenging not only due to class imbalance\nbut also because of varying classification difficulty across categories. Simply\nreweighting classes by frequency often overlooks those that are intrinsically\nhard to learn. To address this, we propose \\textbf{DQRoute}, a modular\nframework that combines difficulty-aware optimization with dynamic expert\ncollaboration. DQRoute first estimates class-wise difficulty based on\nprediction uncertainty and historical performance, and uses this signal to\nguide training with adaptive loss weighting. On the architectural side, DQRoute\nemploys a mixture-of-experts design, where each expert specializes in a\ndifferent region of the class distribution. At inference time, expert\npredictions are weighted by confidence scores derived from expert-specific OOD\ndetectors, enabling input-adaptive routing without the need for a centralized\nrouter. All components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments\non standard long-tailed benchmarks demonstrate that DQRoute significantly\nimproves performance, particularly on rare and difficult classes, highlighting\nthe benefit of integrating difficulty modeling with decentralized expert\nrouting.",

        "summary": "In the era of deep learning, the increasing number of pre-trained models\navailable online presents a wealth of knowledge. These models, developed with\ndiverse architectures and trained on varied datasets for different tasks,\nprovide unique interpretations of the real world. Their collective consensus is\nlikely universal and generalizable to unseen data. However, effectively\nharnessing this collective knowledge poses a fundamental challenge due to the\nheterogeneity of pre-trained models. Existing knowledge integration solutions\ntypically rely on strong assumptions about training data distributions and\nnetwork architectures, limiting them to learning only from specific types of\nmodels and resulting in data and/or inductive biases. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel framework, namely UNIFORM, for knowledge transfer from a\ndiverse set of off-the-shelf models into one student model without such\nconstraints. Specifically, we propose a dedicated voting mechanism to capture\nthe consensus of knowledge both at the logit level -- incorporating teacher\nmodels that are capable of predicting target classes of interest -- and at the\nfeature level, utilizing visual representations learned on arbitrary label\nspaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UNIFORM effectively enhances\nunsupervised object recognition performance compared to strong knowledge\ntransfer baselines. Notably, it exhibits remarkable scalability by benefiting\nfrom over one hundred teachers, while existing methods saturate at a much\nsmaller scale.",

        "summary": "For human cognitive process, spatial reasoning and perception are closely\nentangled, yet the nature of this interplay remains underexplored in the\nevaluation of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While recent MLLM\nadvancements show impressive performance on reasoning, their capacity for\nhuman-like spatial cognition remains an open question. In this work, we\nintroduce a systematic evaluation framework to assess the spatial reasoning\nabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs relative to human performance. Central to\nour work is 11Plus-Bench, a high-quality benchmark derived from realistic\nstandardized spatial aptitude tests. 11Plus-Bench also features fine-grained\nexpert annotations of both perceptual complexity and reasoning process,\nenabling detailed instance-level analysis of model behavior. Through extensive\nexperiments across 14 MLLMs and human evaluation, we find that current MLLMs\nexhibit early signs of spatial cognition. Despite a large performance gap\ncompared to humans, MLLMs' cognitive profiles resemble those of humans in that\ncognitive effort correlates strongly with reasoning-related complexity.\nHowever, instance-level performance in MLLMs remains largely random, whereas\nhuman correctness is highly predictable and shaped by abstract pattern\ncomplexity. These findings highlight both emerging capabilities and limitations\nin current MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities and provide actionable\ninsights for advancing model design.",

        "summary": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers a transformative sensing modality for\nAdvanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving (AD)\napplications, enabling material-level scene understanding through fine spectral\nresolution beyond the capabilities of traditional RGB imaging. This paper\npresents the first comprehensive review of HSI for automotive applications,\nexamining the strengths, limitations, and suitability of current HSI\ntechnologies in the context of ADAS/AD. In addition to this qualitative review,\nwe analyze 216 commercially available HSI and multispectral imaging cameras,\nbenchmarking them against key automotive criteria: frame rate, spatial\nresolution, spectral dimensionality, and compliance with AEC-Q100 temperature\nstandards. Our analysis reveals a significant gap between HSI's demonstrated\nresearch potential and its commercial readiness. Only four cameras meet the\ndefined performance thresholds, and none comply with AEC-Q100 requirements. In\naddition, the paper reviews recent HSI datasets and applications, including\nsemantic segmentation for road surface classification, pedestrian separability,\nand adverse weather perception. Our review shows that current HSI datasets are\nlimited in terms of scale, spectral consistency, the number of spectral\nchannels, and environmental diversity, posing challenges for the development of\nperception algorithms and the adequate validation of HSI's true potential in\nADAS/AD applications. This review paper establishes the current state of HSI in\nautomotive contexts as of 2025 and outlines key research directions toward\npractical integration of spectral imaging in ADAS and autonomous systems.",

        "summary": "Line segment detection in images has been studied for several decades.\nExisting line segment detectors can be roughly divided into two categories:\ngeneric line segment detectors and wireframe line segment detectors. Generic\nline segment detectors aim to detect all meaningful line segments in images and\ntraditional approaches usually fall into this category. Recent deep learning\nbased approaches are mostly wireframe line segment detectors. They detect only\nline segments that are geometrically meaningful and have large spatial support.\nDue to the difference in the aim of design, the performance of generic line\nsegment detectors for the task of wireframe line segment detection won't be\nsatisfactory, and vice versa. In this work, we propose a robust framework that\ncan be used for both generic line segment detection and wireframe line segment\ndetection. The proposed method is an improved version of the Pixel Orientation\nEstimation (POE) method. It is thus named as POEv2. POEv2 detects line segments\nfrom edge strength maps, and can be combined with any edge detector. We show in\nour experiments that by combining the proposed POEv2 with an efficient edge\ndetector, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available\ndatasets.",

        "title": "Quantization Robustness to Input Degradations for Object Detection",
        "summary": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) is crucial for deploying efficient object\ndetection models, like YOLO, on resource-constrained devices. However, the\nimpact of reduced precision on model robustness to real-world input\ndegradations such as noise, blur, and compression artifacts is a significant\nconcern. This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the\nrobustness of YOLO models (nano to extra-large scales) across multiple\nprecision formats: FP32, FP16 (TensorRT), Dynamic UINT8 (ONNX), and Static INT8\n(TensorRT). We introduce and evaluate a degradation-aware calibration strategy\nfor Static INT8 PTQ, where the TensorRT calibration process is exposed to a mix\nof clean and synthetically degraded images. Models were benchmarked on the COCO\ndataset under seven distinct degradation conditions (including various types\nand levels of noise, blur, low contrast, and JPEG compression) and a\nmixed-degradation scenario. Results indicate that while Static INT8 TensorRT\nengines offer substantial speedups (~1.5-3.3x) with a moderate accuracy drop\n(~3-7% mAP50-95) on clean data, the proposed degradation-aware calibration did\nnot yield consistent, broad improvements in robustness over standard clean-data\ncalibration across most models and degradations. A notable exception was\nobserved for larger model scales under specific noise conditions, suggesting\nmodel capacity may influence the efficacy of this calibration approach. These\nfindings highlight the challenges in enhancing PTQ robustness and provide\ninsights for deploying quantized detectors in uncontrolled environments.
