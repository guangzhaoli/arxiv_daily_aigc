        "summary": "The increasing realism of AI-generated images has raised serious concerns\nabout misinformation and privacy violations, highlighting the urgent need for\naccurate and interpretable detection methods. While existing approaches have\nmade progress, most rely on binary classification without explanations or\ndepend heavily on supervised fine-tuning, resulting in limited generalization.\nIn this paper, we propose ThinkFake, a novel reasoning-based and generalizable\nframework for AI-generated image detection. Our method leverages a Multimodal\nLarge Language Model (MLLM) equipped with a forgery reasoning prompt and is\ntrained using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning\nwith carefully designed reward functions. This design enables the model to\nperform step-by-step reasoning and produce interpretable, structured outputs.\nWe further introduce a structured detection pipeline to enhance reasoning\nquality and adaptability. Extensive experiments show that ThinkFake outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods on the GenImage benchmark and demonstrates strong\nzero-shot generalization on the challenging LOKI benchmark. These results\nvalidate our framework's effectiveness and robustness. Code will be released\nupon acceptance.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models have recently been investigated as powerful generative\nsolvers for image dehazing, owing to their remarkable capability to model the\ndata distribution. However, the massive computational burden imposed by the\nretraining of diffusion models, coupled with the extensive sampling steps\nduring the inference, limit the broader application of diffusion models in\nimage dehazing. To address these issues, we explore the properties of hazy\nimages in the semantic latent space of frozen pre-trained diffusion models, and\npropose a Diffusion Latent Inspired network for Image Dehazing, dubbed\nDiffLI$^2$D. Specifically, we first reveal that the semantic latent space of\npre-trained diffusion models can represent the content and haze characteristics\nof hazy images, as the diffusion time-step changes. Building upon this insight,\nwe integrate the diffusion latent representations at different time-steps into\na delicately designed dehazing network to provide instructions for image\ndehazing. Our DiffLI$^2$D avoids re-training diffusion models and iterative\nsampling process by effectively utilizing the informative representations\nderived from the pre-trained diffusion models, which also offers a novel\nperspective for introducing diffusion models to image dehazing. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nsuperior performance to existing image dehazing methods.

        "summary": "Current video-to-audio (V2A) methods struggle in complex multi-event\nscenarios (video scenarios involving multiple sound sources, sound events, or\ntransitions) due to two critical limitations. First, existing methods face\nchallenges in precisely aligning intricate semantic information together with\nrapid dynamic features. Second, foundational training lacks quantitative\npreference optimization for semantic-temporal alignment and audio quality. As a\nresult, it fails to enhance integrated generation quality in cluttered\nmulti-event scenes. To address these core limitations, this study proposes a\nnovel V2A framework: MultiSoundGen. It introduces direct preference\noptimization (DPO) into the V2A domain, leveraging audio-visual pretraining\n(AVP) to enhance performance in complex multi-event scenarios. Our\ncontributions include two key innovations: the first is SlowFast Contrastive\nAVP (SF-CAVP), a pioneering AVP model with a unified dual-stream architecture.\nSF-CAVP explicitly aligns core semantic representations and rapid dynamic\nfeatures of audio-visual data to handle multi-event complexity; second, we\nintegrate the DPO method into V2A task and propose AVP-Ranked Preference\nOptimization (AVP-RPO). It uses SF-CAVP as a reward model to quantify and\nprioritize critical semantic-temporal matches while enhancing audio quality.\nExperiments demonstrate that MultiSoundGen achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nperformance in multi-event scenarios, delivering comprehensive gains across\ndistribution matching, audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal\nsynchronization.

Unlike\nprior methods relying on emotion labels or implicit AU conditioning, our model\nexplicitly maps AUs to 2D facial landmarks, enabling physically grounded,\nper-frame expression control. In the first stage, a variational motion\ngenerator predicts temporally coherent landmark sequences from audio and AU\nintensities. In the second stage, a diffusion-based synthesizer generates\nrealistic, lip-synced videos conditioned on these landmarks and a reference\nimage. This separation of motion and appearance improves expression accuracy,\ntemporal stability, and visual realism.

        "summary": "Existing models often struggle with complex temporal changes, particularly\nwhen generating videos with gradual attribute transitions. The most common\nprompt interpolation approach for motion transitions often fails to handle\ngradual attribute transitions, where inconsistencies tend to become more\npronounced. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method to extend\nexisting models for smooth and consistent attribute transitions, through\nintroducing frame-wise guidance during the denoising process. Our approach\nconstructs a data-specific transitional direction for each noisy latent,\nguiding the gradual shift from initial to final attributes frame by frame while\npreserving the motion dynamics of the video. Moreover, we present the\nControlled-Attribute-Transition Benchmark (CAT-Bench), which integrates both\nattribute and motion dynamics, to comprehensively evaluate the performance of\ndifferent models. We further propose two metrics to assess the accuracy and\nsmoothness of attribute transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that our\napproach performs favorably against existing baselines, achieving visual\nfidelity, maintaining alignment with text prompts, and delivering seamless\nattribute transitions.

Bridging generation and novel\nview synthesis remains a major challenge. We present PhiGenesis, a unified\nframework for 4D scene generation that extends video generation techniques with\ngeometric and temporal consistency. Given multi-view image sequences and camera\nparameters, PhiGenesis produces temporally continuous 4D Gaussian splatting\nrepresentations along target 3D trajectories. In its first stage, PhiGenesis\nleverages a pre-trained video VAE with a novel range-view adapter to enable\nfeed-forward 4D reconstruction from multi-view images. This architecture\nsupports single-frame or video inputs and outputs complete 4D scenes including\ngeometry, semantics, and motion. In the second stage, PhiGenesis introduces a\ngeometric-guided video diffusion model, using rendered historical 4D scenes as\npriors to generate future views conditioned on trajectories. To address\ngeometric exposure bias in novel views, we propose Stereo Forcing, a novel\nconditioning strategy that integrates geometric uncertainty during denoising.\nThis method enhances temporal coherence by dynamically adjusting generative\ninfluence based on uncertainty-aware perturbations. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both\nappearance and geometric reconstruction, temporal generation and novel view\nsynthesis (NVS) tasks, while simultaneously delivering competitive performance\nin downstream evaluations.

        "summary": "Human vision is capable of transforming two-dimensional observations into an\negocentric three-dimensional scene understanding, which underpins the ability\nto translate complex scenes and exhibit adaptive behaviors. This capability,\nhowever, remains lacking in current autonomous driving systems, where\nmainstream approaches primarily rely on depth-based 3D reconstruction rather\nthan true scene understanding. To address this limitation, we propose a novel\nhuman-like framework called OmniScene. First, we introduce the OmniScene\nVision-Language Model (OmniVLM), a vision-language framework that integrates\nmulti-view and temporal perception for holistic 4D scene understanding. Then,\nharnessing a teacher-student OmniVLM architecture and knowledge distillation,\nwe embed textual representations into 3D instance features for semantic\nsupervision, enriching feature learning, and explicitly capturing human-like\nattentional semantics. These feature representations are further aligned with\nhuman driving behaviors, forming a more human-like\nperception-understanding-action architecture. In addition, we propose a\nHierarchical Fusion Strategy (HFS) to address imbalances in modality\ncontributions during multimodal integration. Our approach adaptively calibrates\nthe relative significance of geometric and semantic features at multiple\nabstraction levels, enabling the synergistic use of complementary cues from\nvisual and textual modalities. This learnable dynamic fusion enables a more\nnuanced and effective exploitation of heterogeneous information.

Our goal is to reconstruct\nhigh-fidelity ground truth-like representations of celestial objects, a task\nthat is challenging due to the limited resolution and quality of\nsmall-telescope observations such as the MobilTelesco dataset. Traditional\nmodels such as CycleGAN provide a foundation for image-to-image translation but\nare restricted to 2D mappings and often distort the morphology of stars and\ngalaxies. To overcome these limitations, we extend the CycleGAN framework with\nthree key innovations: 3D convolutional layers to capture volumetric spatial\ncorrelations, multi-spectral fusion to align optical and near-infrared (NIR)\ndomains, and astrophysical regularization modules to preserve stellar\nmorphology. Ground-truth references from multi-mission all-sky surveys spanning\noptical to NIR guide the training process, ensuring that reconstructions remain\nconsistent across spectral bands.

        "summary": "Grounding large language models (LLMs) in domain-specific tasks like post-hoc\ndash-cam driving video analysis is challenging due to their general-purpose\ntraining and lack of structured inductive biases. As vision is often the sole\nmodality available for such analysis (i.e., no LiDAR, GPS, etc.), existing\nvideo-based vision-language models (V-VLMs) struggle with spatial reasoning,\ncausal inference, and explainability of events in the input video. To this end,\nwe introduce iFinder, a structured semantic grounding framework that decouples\nperception from reasoning by translating dash-cam videos into a hierarchical,\ninterpretable data structure for LLMs. iFinder operates as a modular,\ntraining-free pipeline that employs pretrained vision models to extract\ncritical cues -- object pose, lane positions, and object trajectories -- which\nare hierarchically organized into frame- and video-level structures. Combined\nwith a three-block prompting strategy, it enables step-wise, grounded reasoning\nfor the LLM to refine a peer V-VLM's outputs and provide accurate reasoning.\nEvaluations on four public dash-cam video benchmarks show that iFinder's\nproposed grounding with domain-specific cues, especially object orientation and\nglobal context, significantly outperforms end-to-end V-VLMs on four zero-shot\ndriving benchmarks, with up to 39% gains in accident reasoning accuracy. By\ngrounding LLMs with driving domain-specific representations, iFinder offers a\nzero-shot, interpretable, and reliable alternative to end-to-end V-VLMs for\npost-hoc driving video understanding.",

To overcome these limitations, we introduce PhysCtrl, a novel\nframework for physics-grounded image-to-video generation with physical\nparameters and force control. At its core is a generative physics network that\nlearns the distribution of physical dynamics across four materials (elastic,\nsand, plasticine, and rigid) via a diffusion model conditioned on physics\nparameters and applied forces. We represent physical dynamics as 3D point\ntrajectories and train on a large-scale synthetic dataset of 550K animations\ngenerated by physics simulators.

Experiments show that PhysCtrl generates realistic,\nphysics-grounded motion trajectories which, when used to drive image-to-video\nmodels, yield high-fidelity, controllable videos that outperform existing\nmethods in both visual quality and physical plausibility.

However, incorporating pose\nconditions into VTON models presents several challenges, including selecting\nthe optimal pose representation, integrating poses without additional\nparameters, and balancing pose preservation with flexible pose control.\n  In this work, we build upon a baseline VTON model that concatenates the\nreference image condition without external encoder, control network, or complex\nattention layers. We investigate methods to incorporate pose control into this\npure concatenation paradigm by spatially concatenating pose data, comparing\nperformance using pose maps and skeletons, without adding any additional\nparameters or module to the baseline model. Our experiments reveal that pose\nstitching with pose maps yields the best results, enhancing both pose\npreservation and output realism.

Moreover, most approaches treat all spatial\nregions uniformly, overlooking the distinct statistical differences between\nanomaly and background areas. This uniform treatment hinders the synthesis of\ncontrollable, structure-specific anomalies tailored for segmentation tasks. In\nthis paper, we propose FAST, a foreground-aware diffusion framework featuring\ntwo novel modules: the Anomaly-Informed Accelerated Sampling (AIAS) and the\nForeground-Aware Reconstruction Module (FARM). AIAS is a training-free sampling\nalgorithm specifically designed for segmentation-oriented industrial anomaly\nsynthesis, which accelerates the reverse process through coarse-to-fine\naggregation and enables the synthesis of state-of-the-art segmentation-oriented\nanomalies in as few as 10 steps. Meanwhile, FARM adaptively adjusts the\nanomaly-aware noise within the masked foreground regions at each sampling step,\npreserving localized anomaly signals throughout the denoising trajectory.\nExtensive experiments on multiple industrial benchmarks demonstrate that FAST\nconsistently outperforms existing anomaly synthesis methods in downstream\nsegmentation tasks.

However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid\narchitectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial\nstacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to\naddress the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information\nconflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively\npropose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular\nhierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in\nparallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information.\nThe modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling\ncapability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient\ninformation transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of\nfeatures and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods.\nFurthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve\nprecise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic\ninformation, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and\nresulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance\nmulti-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise\ninterference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to\nreplace traditional skip connections.

        "summary": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of\ncancer-related mortality in women globally. Mammography is essential for the\nearly detection and diagnosis of breast lesions. Despite recent progress in\nfoundation models (FMs) for mammogram analysis, their clinical translation\nremains constrained by several fundamental limitations, including insufficient\ndiversity in training data, limited model generalizability, and a lack of\ncomprehensive evaluation across clinically relevant tasks. Here, we introduce\nVersaMammo, a versatile foundation model for mammograms, designed to overcome\nthese limitations. We curated the largest multi-institutional mammogram dataset\nto date, comprising 706,239 images from 21 sources. To improve generalization,\nwe propose a two-stage pre-training strategy to develop VersaMammo, a mammogram\nfoundation model. First, a teacher model is trained via self-supervised\nlearning to extract transferable features from unlabeled mammograms. Then,\nsupervised learning combined with knowledge distillation transfers both\nfeatures and clinical knowledge into VersaMammo. To ensure a comprehensive\nevaluation, we established a benchmark comprising 92 specific tasks, including\n68 internal tasks and 24 external validation tasks, spanning 5 major clinical\ntask categories: lesion detection, segmentation, classification, image\nretrieval, and visual question answering. VersaMammo achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance, ranking first in 50 out of 68 specific internal tasks and 20 out\nof 24 external validation tasks, with average ranks of 1.5 and 1.2,\nrespectively. These results demonstrate its superior generalization and\nclinical utility, offering a substantial advancement toward reliable and\nscalable breast cancer screening and diagnosis.",

Changes\nin input data distributions caused by sensor drift or lighting variations\nnecessitate continual model adaptation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid\ntraining methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by\ncombining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method\nbegins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to\nachieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed\nfor online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to\nshifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness\nof Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational\nefficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly\nwell-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic\naccelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets\ndemonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a\nreduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining\nmodel performance in dynamic environments.",

We revisit this hypothesis by examining limitations in the\ncue-conflict experiment by Geirhos et al. To address these limitations, we\npropose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through\nsystematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the\nconfounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks\nunder controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently\ntexture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless,\nthis reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies\nor architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across\ncomputer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance\npatterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape,\nmedical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a\nstronger reliance towards texture.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose PU-Gaussian, a novel upsampling network that models the\nlocal neighborhood around each point using anisotropic 3D Gaussian\ndistributions. These Gaussians capture the underlying geometric structure,\nallowing us to perform upsampling explicitly in the local geometric domain by\ndirect point sampling. The sampling process generates a dense, but coarse,\npoint cloud. A subsequent refinement network adjusts the coarse output to\nproduce a more uniform distribution and sharper edges.

        "title": "Universal Camouflage Attack on Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving",
        "summary": "Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising\nresearch direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning\ncapabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains\nvulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve\nmisleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing\nattacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily\ntarget vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD\nsystems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2)\nAdversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital\nlevel. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage\nAttack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on\noptimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate\nphysically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization\nacross different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the\nobserved vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA\nintroduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational\ndiscrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates\na multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its\nadaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world\nscenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various\nVLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing\nstate-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore,\nUCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic\nconditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.",

This is partly due to the lack of controlled,\nground-truthed testing environments that account for the optical challenges,\nsuch as color distortion from spectrally variant light attenuation, reduced\ncontrast and blur from backscatter and volume scattering, and dynamic light\npatterns from natural or artificial illumination. Additionally, the appearance\nof ocean water in images varies significantly across regions, depths, and\nseasons. However, most machine vision evaluations are conducted under specific\noptical water types and imaging conditions, therefore often lack\ngeneralizability. Exhaustive testing across diverse open-water scenarios is\ntechnically impractical. To address this, we introduce the \\textit{Optical\nOcean Recipes}, a framework for creating realistic datasets under controlled\nunderwater conditions. Unlike synthetic or open-water data, these recipes,\nusing calibrated color and scattering additives, enable repeatable and\ncontrolled testing of the impact of water composition on image appearance.\nHence, this provides a unique framework for analyzing machine vision in\nrealistic, yet controlled underwater scenarios. The controlled environment\nenables the creation of ground-truth data for a range of vision tasks,\nincluding water parameter estimation, image restoration, segmentation, visual\nSLAM, and underwater image synthesis.

Traditional approaches treat the figure and accompanying\ntext (e.g., questions and answer options) as separate inputs. EXAMS-V\nintroduced a new paradigm by embedding both visual and textual content into a\nsingle image. However, even state-of-the-art proprietary models perform poorly\non this setup in zero-shot settings, underscoring the need for task-specific\nfine-tuning. To address the scarcity of training data in this \"text-in-image\"\nformat, we synthesize a new dataset by converting existing separate image-text\npairs into unified images. Fine-tuning a small multilingual multimodal model on\na mix of our synthetic data and EXAMS-V yields notable gains across 13\nlanguages, demonstrating strong average improvements and cross-lingual\ntransfer.",

        "summary": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures spatial information along with dense\nspectral measurements across numerous narrow wavelength bands. This rich\nspectral content has the potential to facilitate robust robotic perception,\nparticularly in environments with complex material compositions, varying\nillumination, or other visually challenging conditions. However, current HSI\nsemantic segmentation methods underperform due to their reliance on\narchitectures and learning frameworks optimized for RGB inputs. In this work,\nwe propose a novel hyperspectral adapter that leverages pretrained vision\nfoundation models to effectively learn from hyperspectral data. Our\narchitecture incorporates a spectral transformer and a spectrum-aware spatial\nprior module to extract rich spatial-spectral features. Additionally, we\nintroduce a modality-aware interaction block that facilitates effective\nintegration of hyperspectral representations and frozen vision Transformer\nfeatures through dedicated extraction and injection mechanisms. Extensive\nevaluations on three benchmark autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that our\narchitecture achieves state-of-the-art semantic segmentation performance while\ndirectly using HSI inputs, outperforming both vision-based and hyperspectral\nsegmentation methods.

        "summary": "Encoder-Decoder architectures are widely used in deep learning-based\nDeformable Image Registration (DIR), where the encoder extracts multi-scale\nfeatures and the decoder predicts deformation fields by recovering spatial\nlocations. However, current methods lack specialized extraction of features\n(that are useful for registration) and predict deformation jointly and\nhomogeneously in all three directions. In this paper, we propose a novel\nexpert-guided DIR network with Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism applied in\nboth encoder and decoder, named SHMoAReg. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture\nof Attention heads (MoA) into encoder layers, while Spatial Heterogeneous\nMixture of Experts (SHMoE) into the decoder layers. The MoA enhances the\nspecialization of feature extraction by dynamically selecting the optimal\ncombination of attention heads for each image token. Meanwhile, the SHMoE\npredicts deformation fields heterogeneously in three directions for each voxel\nusing experts with varying kernel sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on two\npublicly available datasets show consistent improvements over various methods,\nwith a notable increase from 60.58% to 65.58% in Dice score for the abdominal\nCT dataset. Furthermore, SHMoAReg enhances model interpretability by\ndifferentiating experts' utilities across/within different resolution layers.\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce MoE mechanism into\nDIR tasks.

        "summary": "Current multimodal fusion approaches in computational oncology primarily\nfocus on integrating multi-gigapixel histology whole slide images (WSIs) with\ngenomic or transcriptomic data, demonstrating improved survival prediction. We\nhypothesize that incorporating pathology reports can further enhance prognostic\nperformance. Pathology reports, as essential components of clinical workflows,\noffer readily available complementary information by summarizing\nhistopathological findings and integrating expert interpretations and clinical\ncontext. However, fusing these modalities poses challenges due to their\nheterogeneous nature. WSIs are high-dimensional, each containing several\nbillion pixels, whereas pathology reports consist of concise text summaries of\nvarying lengths, leading to potential modality imbalance. To address this, we\npropose a prototype-based approach to generate balanced representations, which\nare then integrated using a Transformer-based fusion model for survival\nprediction that we term PS3 (Predicting Survival from Three Modalities).\nSpecifically, we present: (1) Diagnostic prototypes from pathology reports,\nleveraging self-attention to extract diagnostically relevant sections and\nstandardize text representation; (2) Histological prototypes to compactly\nrepresent key morphological patterns in WSIs; and (3) Biological pathway\nprototypes to encode transcriptomic expressions, accurately capturing cellular\nfunctions. PS3, the three-modal transformer model, processes the resulting\nprototype-based multimodal tokens and models intra-modal and cross-modal\ninteractions across pathology reports, WSIs and transcriptomic data.

However, existing IML methods\nremain manipulation-process-agnostic, directly producing localization masks in\na one-shot prediction paradigm without modeling the underlying editing steps.\nThis one-shot paradigm compresses the high-dimensional compositional space into\na single binary mask, inducing severe dimensional collapse, thereby creating a\nfundamental mismatch with the intrinsic nature of the IML task.\n  To address this, we are the first to reformulate image manipulation\nlocalization as a conditional sequence prediction task, proposing the RITA\nframework. RITA predicts manipulated regions layer-by-layer in an ordered\nmanner, using each step's prediction as the condition for the next, thereby\nexplicitly modeling temporal dependencies and hierarchical structures among\nediting operations.\n  To enable training and evaluation, we synthesize multi-step manipulation data\nand construct a new benchmark HSIM. We further propose the HSS metric to assess\nsequential order and hierarchical alignment.

Specifically, the crafted targeted adversarial examples (AEs)\nexhibit limited generalization to partially known or semantically similar\ntargets in cross-modal alignment tasks (i.e., limited generalizability) and can\nbe easily detected by simple anomaly detection methods (i.e., limited\nundetectability). To address these limitations, we propose a novel method\ncalled Proxy Targeted Attack (PTA), which leverages multiple source-modal and\ntarget-modal proxies to optimize targeted AEs, ensuring they remain evasive to\ndefenses while aligning with multiple potential targets. We also provide\ntheoretical analyses to highlight the relationship between generalizability and\nundetectability and to ensure optimal generalizability while meeting the\nspecified requirements for undetectability.

        "summary": "Recently, camera-controlled video generation has seen rapid development,\noffering more precise control over video generation. However, existing methods\npredominantly focus on camera control in perspective projection video\ngeneration, while geometrically consistent panoramic video generation remains\nchallenging. This limitation is primarily due to the inherent complexities in\npanoramic pose representation and spherical projection. To address this issue,\nwe propose CamPVG, the first diffusion-based framework for panoramic video\ngeneration guided by precise camera poses. We achieve camera position encoding\nfor panoramic images and cross-view feature aggregation based on spherical\nprojection. Specifically, we propose a panoramic Pl\\\"ucker embedding that\nencodes camera extrinsic parameters through spherical coordinate\ntransformation. This pose encoder effectively captures panoramic geometry,\novercoming the limitations of traditional methods when applied to\nequirectangular projections. Additionally, we introduce a spherical epipolar\nmodule that enforces geometric constraints through adaptive attention masking\nalong epipolar lines. This module enables fine-grained cross-view feature\naggregation, substantially enhancing the quality and consistency of generated\npanoramic videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method generates\nhigh-quality panoramic videos consistent with camera trajectories, far\nsurpassing existing methods in panoramic video generation.",

        "summary": "Audio-driven talking face generation has received growing interest,\nparticularly for applications requiring expressive and natural human-avatar\ninteraction. However, most existing emotion-aware methods rely on a single\nmodality (either audio or image) for emotion embedding, limiting their ability\nto capture nuanced affective cues. Additionally, most methods condition on a\nsingle reference image, restricting the model's ability to represent dynamic\nchanges in actions or attributes across time. To address these issues, we\nintroduce SynchroRaMa, a novel framework that integrates a multi-modal emotion\nembedding by combining emotional signals from text (via sentiment analysis) and\naudio (via speech-based emotion recognition and audio-derived valence-arousal\nfeatures), enabling the generation of talking face videos with richer and more\nauthentic emotional expressiveness and fidelity. To ensure natural head motion\nand accurate lip synchronization, SynchroRaMa includes an audio-to-motion (A2M)\nmodule that generates motion frames aligned with the input audio. Finally,\nSynchroRaMa incorporates scene descriptions generated by Large Language Model\n(LLM) as additional textual input, enabling it to capture dynamic actions and\nhigh-level semantic attributes. Conditioning the model on both visual and\ntextual cues enhances temporal consistency and visual realism. Quantitative and\nqualitative experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SynchroRaMa\noutperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving improvements in image quality,\nexpression preservation, and motion realism. A user study further confirms that\nSynchroRaMa achieves higher subjective ratings than competing methods in\noverall naturalness, motion diversity, and video smoothness.

        "summary": "This paper presents GS-RoadPatching, an inpainting method for driving scene\ncompletion by referring to completely reconstructed regions, which are\nrepresented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike existing 3DGS inpainting\nmethods that perform generative completion relying on 2D perspective-view-based\ndiffusion or GAN models to predict limited appearance or depth cues for missing\nregions, our approach enables substitutional scene inpainting and editing\ndirectly through the 3DGS modality, extricating it from requiring\nspatial-temporal consistency of 2D cross-modals and eliminating the need for\ntime-intensive retraining of Gaussians. Our key insight is that the highly\nrepetitive patterns in driving scenes often share multi-modal similarities\nwithin the implicit 3DGS feature space and are particularly suitable for\nstructural matching to enable effective 3DGS-based substitutional inpainting.\nPractically, we construct feature-embedded 3DGS scenes to incorporate a patch\nmeasurement method for abstracting local context at different scales and,\nsubsequently, propose a structural search method to find candidate patches in\n3D space effectively. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective\nsubstitution-and-fusion optimization for better visual harmony. We conduct\nextensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets to demonstrate\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method in driving scenes, and\nthe results validate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance\ncompared to the baseline methods in terms of both quality and interoperability.\nAdditional experiments in general scenes also demonstrate the applicability of\nthe proposed 3D inpainting strategy.

However, their safety and robustness against adversarial\nattacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a\ncritical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can \"freeze\" VLA\nmodels and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat\neffectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions,\npotentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically\nstudy this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that\ngenerates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level\noptimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic\nbenchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%,\nsignificantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images\ngenerated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image\nreliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts.

Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task\nsilos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no\nstandardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction\nbetween detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task\nadversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single\nperturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing\nmonocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that\nsupports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common\ndetectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation\n(EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that\ncouples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth\nbias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far\nmisperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also\npropose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and\nreal-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear\nasymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer.

        "summary": "Achieving high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging on\nresource-constrained edge devices is a critical challenge in computer vision,\nas its performance directly impacts downstream tasks such as intelligent\nsurveillance and autonomous driving. Multi-Exposure Fusion (MEF) is a\nmainstream technique to achieve this goal; however, existing methods generally\nface the dual bottlenecks of high computational costs and ghosting artifacts,\nhindering their widespread deployment. To this end, this study proposes a\nlight-weight Vision Transformer architecture designed explicitly for HDR\nreconstruction to overcome these limitations. This study is based on the\nContext-Aware Vision Transformer and begins by converting input images to the\nYCbCr color space to separate luminance and chrominance information. It then\nemploys an Intersection-Aware Adaptive Fusion (IAAF) module to suppress\nghosting effectively. To further achieve a light-weight design, we introduce\nInverted Residual Embedding (IRE), Dynamic Tanh (DyT), and propose Enhanced\nMulti-Scale Dilated Convolution (E-MSDC) to reduce computational complexity at\nmultiple levels. Our study ultimately contributes two model versions: a main\nversion for high visual quality and a light-weight version with advantages in\ncomputational efficiency, both of which achieve an excellent balance between\nperformance and image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared\nto the baseline, the main version reduces FLOPS by approximately 67% and\nincreases inference speed by more than fivefold on CPU and 2.5 times on an edge\ndevice. These results confirm that our method provides an efficient and\nghost-free HDR imaging solution for edge devices, demonstrating versatility and\npracticality across various dynamic scenarios.",

        "summary": "Recently, visual prompt tuning is introduced to RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) tracking\nas a parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) method. However, these PEFT-based\nRGB-T tracking methods typically rely solely on spatial domain information as\nprompts for feature extraction. As a result, they often fail to achieve optimal\nperformance by overlooking the crucial role of frequency-domain information in\nprompt learning. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Visual Fourier\nPrompt Tracking (named VFPTrack) method to learn modality-related prompts via\nFast Fourier Transform (FFT). Our method consists of symmetric feature\nextraction encoder with shared parameters, visual fourier prompts, and Modality\nFusion Prompt Generator that generates bidirectional interaction prompts\nthrough multi-modal feature fusion. Specifically, we first use a frozen feature\nextraction encoder to extract RGB and thermal infrared (TIR) modality features.\nThen, we combine the visual prompts in the spatial domain with the frequency\ndomain prompts obtained from the FFT, which allows for the full extraction and\nunderstanding of modality features from different domain information. Finally,\nunlike previous fusion methods, the modality fusion prompt generation module we\nuse combines features from different modalities to generate a fused modality\nprompt. This modality prompt is interacted with each individual modality to\nfully enable feature interaction across different modalities. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on three popular RGB-T tracking benchmarks show that our\nmethod demonstrates outstanding performance.",

These models process entire video clips, but provide no\nassurance that classification is based on clinically relevant features known to\nbe associated with CA. An alternative paradigm for disease classification is to\napply models to quantitative features such as strain, ensuring that the\nclassification relates to clinically relevant features. Drawing inspiration\nfrom this approach, we explicitly constrain a transformer model to the\nanatomical region where many known CA abnormalities occur -- the myocardium,\nwhich we embed as a set of deforming points and corresponding sampled image\npatches into input tokens. We show that our anatomical constraint can also be\napplied to the popular self-supervised learning masked autoencoder\npre-training, where we propose to mask and reconstruct only anatomical patches.\nWe show that by constraining both the transformer and pre-training task to the\nmyocardium where CA imaging features are localized, we achieve increased\nperformance on a CA classification task compared to full video transformers.\nOur model provides an explicit guarantee that the classification is focused on\nonly anatomical regions of the echo, and enables us to visualize transformer\nattention scores over the deforming myocardium.",

        "summary": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have emerged as a promising solution\nfor adapting pre-trained models to various downstream tasks. While these\nmethods perform well in single-task learning, extending them to multi-task\nlearning exacerbates common challenges, such as task interference and negative\ntransfer, due to the limited number of trainable parameters. To address these\nissues, we introduce progressive task-specific multi-task adaptation, a novel\nparameter-efficient approach for multi-task learning. This approach introduces\nadapter modules in a pre-trained model such that these modules are shared\nacross all tasks in the initial layers and become progressively more\ntask-specific in the later layers. The motivation is to reduce the conflicts\namong tasks by allowing transfer learning across all tasks in the initial\nlayers and enabling task-specific learning toward the prediction heads.\nAdditionally, we propose a gradient-based approach for computing task\nsimilarity and use this measure to allocate similar tasks to the shared adapter\nmodules. Our task similarity method introduces minimal overhead in the\npipeline. We evaluate our approach by adapting the Swin Transformer for dense\nprediction tasks. Experiments on the PASCAL and NYUD-v2 datasets demonstrate\nthat our approach outperforms a fully fine-tuned multi-task model while\nrequiring only one-fifth of the trainable parameters.

These\ndetectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and\naesthetics.

The lack of\nannotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive\npseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate\nunlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To\naddress this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically\ninjects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined\nregion, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling.

        "summary": "Training robust bimanual manipulation policies via imitation learning\nrequires demonstration data with broad coverage over robot poses, contacts, and\nscene contexts. However, collecting diverse and precise real-world\ndemonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior\nworks have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either\neye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel\nimages without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand\n(third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this\npaper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data\nAugmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method\nthat fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D\nobservations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates\ncorresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained\noptimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate\ngripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our\nmethod on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625\nsimulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms\nbaselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data\naugmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation.

        "summary": "Computed tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used non-invasive imaging\nmodalities for medical diagnosis. In clinical practice, CT images are usually\nacquired with large slice thicknesses due to the high cost of memory storage\nand operation time, resulting in an anisotropic CT volume with much lower\ninter-slice resolution than in-plane resolution. Since such inconsistent\nresolution may lead to difficulties in disease diagnosis, deep learning-based\nvolumetric super-resolution methods have been developed to improve inter-slice\nresolution. Most existing methods conduct single-image super-resolution on the\nthrough-plane or synthesize intermediate slices from adjacent slices; however,\nthe anisotropic characteristic of 3D CT volume has not been well explored. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel cross-view texture transfer approach for CT\nslice interpolation by fully utilizing the anisotropic nature of 3D CT volume.\nSpecifically, we design a unique framework that takes high-resolution in-plane\ntexture details as a reference and transfers them to low-resolution\nthrough-plane images. To this end, we introduce a multi-reference non-local\nattention module that extracts meaningful features for reconstructing\nthrough-plane high-frequency details from multiple in-plane images. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method performs significantly\nbetter in CT slice interpolation than existing competing methods on public CT\ndatasets including a real-paired benchmark, verifying the effectiveness of the\nproposed framework.

        "summary": "Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for\naccurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace\ngases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent\nfor MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this\nstudy, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow\ndetection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments.\nCloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened\nout as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the\nquantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques\nincluding Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),\nwith advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel\nAttention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods\nstruggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the\ndetection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially\nimprove detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure,\nwhile SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses\nUNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral\nattention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various\ndisparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and\neffectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust,\nscalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing\nmethane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation\nhyperspectral missions.

However, significant\ndomain gaps in visual appearance, sensor modalities, and kinematics between\nhuman and robot impede knowledge transfer. This paper presents EgoBridge, a\nunified co-training framework that explicitly aligns the policy latent spaces\nbetween human and robot data using domain adaptation. Through a measure of\ndiscrepancy on the joint policy latent features and actions based on Optimal\nTransport (OT), we learn observation representations that not only align\nbetween the human and robot domain but also preserve the action-relevant\ninformation critical for policy learning. EgoBridge achieves a significant\nabsolute policy success rate improvement by 44% over human-augmented\ncross-embodiment baselines in three real-world single-arm and bimanual\nmanipulation tasks.

        "summary": "In the current digital era, facial recognition systems offer significant\nutility and have been widely integrated into modern technological\ninfrastructures; however, their widespread use has also raised serious privacy\nconcerns, prompting regulations that mandate data removal upon request. Machine\nunlearning has emerged as a powerful solution to address this issue by\nselectively removing the influence of specific user data from trained models\nwhile preserving overall model performance. However, existing machine\nunlearning techniques largely depend on supervised techniques requiring\nidentity labels, which are often unavailable in privacy-constrained situations\nor in large-scale, noisy datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce\nCURE (Centroid-guided Unsupervised Representation Erasure), the first\nunsupervised unlearning framework for facial recognition systems that operates\nwithout the use of identity labels, effectively removing targeted samples while\npreserving overall performance. We also propose a novel metric, the Unlearning\nEfficiency Score (UES), which balances forgetting and retention stability,\naddressing shortcomings in the current evaluation metrics. CURE significantly\noutperforms unsupervised variants of existing unlearning methods. Additionally,\nwe conducted quality-aware unlearning by designating low-quality images as the\nforget set, demonstrating its usability and benefits, and highlighting the role\nof image quality in machine unlearning.",

        "summary": "Face recognition is an open-set problem requiring high discriminative power\nto ensure that intra-class distances remain smaller than inter-class distances.\nMargin-based softmax losses, such as SphereFace, CosFace, and ArcFace, have\nbeen widely adopted to enhance intra-class compactness and inter-class\nseparability, yet they overlook the impact of noisy samples. By examining the\ndistribution of samples in the angular space, we observe that clean samples\npredominantly cluster in the center region, whereas noisy samples tend to shift\ntoward the peripheral region. Motivated by this observation, we propose the\nExponential Angular Margin Loss (ExpFace), which introduces an angular\nexponential term as the margin. This design applies a larger penalty in the\ncenter region and a smaller penalty in the peripheral region within the angular\nspace, thereby emphasizing clean samples while suppressing noisy samples. We\npresent a unified analysis of ExpFace and classical margin-based softmax losses\nin terms of margin embedding forms, similarity curves, and gradient curves,\nshowing that ExpFace not only avoids the training instability of SphereFace and\nthe non-monotonicity of ArcFace, but also exhibits a similarity curve that\napplies penalties in the same manner as the decision boundary in the angular\nspace.

        "summary": "Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from\ncontinuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key\nchallenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial\nforgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown\nadvanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we\nunderscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise\nknowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge\ncoherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across\nclients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt\nclass-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During\nprompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge\nconflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts,\nintensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we\npropose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method\nthat explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt\ncommunication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism\n(LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across\nclients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a\nclass-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate\ninter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant\nknowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks\ndemonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Achieving both capabilities under degraded sensing and without global\nlocalization remains an open challenge. Recent works on relative navigation\nhave shown robust tracking by anchoring planning and control to a visible\ndetected object, but cannot address navigation when no target is in the field\nof view. We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time\nframework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single\nrelative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard\ninstantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling\nreactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same\nperception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking.

        "summary": "To enable robots to comprehend high-level human instructions and perform\ncomplex tasks, a key challenge lies in achieving comprehensive scene\nunderstanding: interpreting and interacting with the 3D environment in a\nmeaningful way. This requires a smart map that fuses accurate geometric\nstructure with rich, human-understandable semantics. To address this, we\nintroduce the 3D Queryable Scene Representation (3D QSR), a novel framework\nbuilt on multimedia data that unifies three complementary 3D representations:\n(1) 3D-consistent novel view rendering and segmentation from panoptic\nreconstruction, (2) precise geometry from 3D point clouds, and (3) structured,\nscalable organization via 3D scene graphs. Built on an object-centric design,\nthe framework integrates with large vision-language models to enable semantic\nqueryability by linking multimodal object embeddings, and supporting\nobject-level retrieval of geometric, visual, and semantic information. The\nretrieved data are then loaded into a robotic task planner for downstream\nexecution. We evaluate our approach through simulated robotic task planning\nscenarios in Unity, guided by abstract language instructions and using the\nindoor public dataset Replica. Furthermore, we apply it in a digital duplicate\nof a real wet lab environment to test QSR-supported robotic task planning for\nemergency response. The results demonstrate the framework's ability to\nfacilitate scene understanding and integrate spatial and semantic reasoning,\neffectively translating high-level human instructions into precise robotic task\nplanning in complex 3D environments.",

        "summary": "Overlap-based metrics such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) penalize\nsegmentation errors more heavily in smaller structures. As organ size differs\nby sex, this implies that a segmentation error of equal magnitude may result in\nlower DSCs in women due to their smaller average organ volumes compared to men.\nWhile previous work has examined sex-based differences in models or datasets,\nno study has yet investigated the potential bias introduced by the DSC itself.\nThis study quantifies sex-based differences of the DSC and the normalized DSC\nin an idealized setting independent of specific models. We applied\nequally-sized synthetic errors to manual MRI annotations from 50 participants\nto ensure sex-based comparability. Even minimal errors (e.g., a 1 mm boundary\nshift) produced systematic DSC differences between sexes. For small structures,\naverage DSC differences were around 0.03; for medium-sized structures around\n0.01. Only large structures (i.e., lungs and liver) were mostly unaffected,\nwith sex-based DSC differences close to zero. These findings underline that\nfairness studies using the DSC as an evaluation metric should not expect\nidentical scores between men and women, as the metric itself introduces bias. A\nsegmentation model may perform equally well across sexes in terms of error\nmagnitude, even if observed DSC values suggest otherwise. Importantly, our work\nraises awareness of a previously underexplored source of sex-based differences\nin segmentation performance. One that arises not from model behavior, but from\nthe metric itself. Recognizing this factor is essential for more accurate and\nfair evaluations in medical image analysis.",

Unlike static data\ngeneration, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal\ndistribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that\ngovern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework\nthat integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture\nglobal structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network\ntrained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through\nnext-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial\nfeedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real\nand synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All\ncomponents are built using masked attention architectures optimized for\nsequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both\nunconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results\nacross diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED\ngenerates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than\nstate-of-the-art generative models.",

        "summary": "The escalating economic losses in agriculture due to deer intrusion,\nestimated to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars annually in the U.S.,\nhighlight the inadequacy of traditional mitigation strategies since these\nmethods are often labor-intensive, costly, and ineffective for modern farming\nsystems. To overcome this, there is a critical need for intelligent, autonomous\nsolutions which require accurate and efficient deer detection. But the progress\nin this field is impeded by a significant gap in the literature, mainly the\nlack of a domain-specific, practical dataset and limited study on the on-field\ndeployability of deer detection systems. Addressing this gap, this study\npresents a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning models\nfor deer detection in challenging real-world scenarios. The contributions of\nthis work are threefold. First, we introduce a curated, publicly available\ndataset of 3,095 annotated images with bounding-box annotations of deer,\nderived from the Idaho Cameratraps project. Second, we provide an extensive\ncomparative analysis of 12 model variants across four recent YOLO\narchitectures(v8, v9, v10, and v11). Finally, we benchmarked performance on a\nhigh-end NVIDIA RTX 5090 GPU and evaluated on two representative edge computing\nplatforms: Raspberry Pi 5 and NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier. Results show that the\nreal-time detection is not feasible in Raspberry Pi without hardware-specific\nmodel optimization, while NVIDIA Jetson provides greater than 30 FPS with\nGPU-accelerated inference on 's' and 'n' series models. This study also reveals\nthat smaller, architecturally advanced models such as YOLOv11n, YOLOv8s, and\nYOLOv9s offer the optimal balance of high accuracy (AP@.5 > 0.85) and\ncomputational efficiency (FPS > 30).

However, detecting Shatian pomelo in\ncomplex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including\nmulti-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object\ndetection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset\nSTP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection.\nSDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional\ninformation without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the\npresented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its\nability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple\nEfficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to\nreduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations,\nthereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment,\nwe compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models\nin Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of\n0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5,\nmAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively.

        "summary": "The integration of aerial and ground images has been a promising solution in\n3D modeling of complex scenes, which is seriously restricted by finding\nreliable correspondences. The primary contribution of this study is a feature\nmatching algorithm for aerial and ground images, whose core idea is to generate\nintermediate views to alleviate perspective distortions caused by the extensive\nviewpoint changes. First, by using aerial images only, sparse models are\nreconstructed through an incremental SfM (Structure from Motion) engine due to\ntheir large scene coverage. Second, 3D Gaussian Splatting is then adopted for\nscene rendering by taking as inputs sparse points and oriented images. For\naccurate view rendering, a render viewpoint determination algorithm is designed\nby using the oriented camera poses of aerial images, which is used to generate\nhigh-quality intermediate images that can bridge the gap between aerial and\nground images. Third, with the aid of intermediate images, reliable feature\nmatching is conducted for match pairs from render-aerial and render-ground\nimages, and final matches can be generated by transmitting correspondences\nthrough intermediate views. By using real aerial and ground datasets, the\nvalidation of the proposed solution has been verified in terms of feature\nmatching and scene rendering and compared comprehensively with widely used\nmethods. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution can\nprovide reliable feature matches for aerial and ground images with an obvious\nincrease in the number of initial and refined matches, and it can provide\nenough matches to achieve accurate ISfM reconstruction and complete 3DGS-based\nscene rendering.",

        "summary": "The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and\naccurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for\ndedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods\nsegment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called\nsuperpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment\nstandard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without\ndistortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called\nSphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide\n360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of\nthe 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path\nbetween a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering\nfeatures. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space\nto compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation\naccuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity\naspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space,\naddressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure.\nFinally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o\nspherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional\nimages. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical\nstate-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to\nnoise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based\napplications on 360o images.",

To address this limitation, recent decoupled dataset\ndistillation methods (e.g., SRe$^2$L) separate the teacher model pre-training\nfrom the synthetic data generation process. These methods also introduce random\ndata augmentation and epoch-wise soft labels during the post-evaluation phase\nto improve performance and generalization. However, existing decoupled\ndistillation methods suffer from inconsistent post-evaluation protocols, which\nhinders progress in the field. In this work, we propose Rectified Decoupled\nDataset Distillation (RD$^3$), and systematically investigate how different\npost-evaluation settings affect test accuracy. We further examine whether the\nreported performance differences across existing methods reflect true\nmethodological advances or stem from discrepancies in evaluation procedures.\nOur analysis reveals that much of the performance variation can be attributed\nto inconsistent evaluation rather than differences in the intrinsic quality of\nthe synthetic data. In addition, we identify general strategies that improve\nthe effectiveness of distilled datasets across settings. By establishing a\nstandardized benchmark and rigorous evaluation protocol, RD$^3$ provides a\nfoundation for fair and reproducible comparisons in future dataset distillation\nresearch.",

        "summary": "Executing open-ended natural language queries is a core problem in robotics.\nWhile recent advances in imitation learning and vision-language-actions models\n(VLAs) have enabled promising end-to-end policies, these models struggle when\nfaced with complex instructions and new scenes. An alternative is to design an\nexplicit scene representation as a queryable interface between the robot and\nthe world, using query results to guide downstream motion planning. In this\nwork, we present Agentic Scene Policies (ASP), an agentic framework that\nleverages the advanced semantic, spatial, and affordance-based querying\ncapabilities of modern scene representations to implement a capable\nlanguage-conditioned robot policy. ASP can execute open-vocabulary queries in a\nzero-shot manner by explicitly reasoning about object affordances in the case\nof more complex skills. Through extensive experiments, we compare ASP with VLAs\non tabletop manipulation problems and showcase how ASP can tackle room-level\nqueries through affordance-guided navigation, and a scaled-up scene\nrepresentation.
