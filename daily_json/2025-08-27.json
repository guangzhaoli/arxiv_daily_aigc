        "summary": "Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant\ninnovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable\nprogress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,\nmeshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge\nfrom traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.\nThe automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings\nremains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To\naddress this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a\nsequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly\ninform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric\nprecision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose\nDrawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a\nnetwork-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise\ngeometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples\ncommand type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,\nand a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility\nin CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,\na dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct\nthorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

        "summary": "High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos\nremains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing\nsubtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian\nSplatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed\nper-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear\ndeformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address\nthese issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially\nadaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene\nreconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ\ndynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially\nvarying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex\nlighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model\n(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable\ntime-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized\ntissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical\ninteractions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and\nbenchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior\n3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\\%) while maintaining real-time\nrendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by\nbalancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for\nintraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.",

        "summary": "Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of\nthe video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding\nand generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail\nimbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the\nother. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a\nlack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this\nissue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed\nthe Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage\npipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)\nOptimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)\nbased on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness\nand accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching\nand bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and\nGRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning\nmulti-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.\nExperimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements\ncompared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2\nAcc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1).

        "summary": "Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent\nsuccess of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects\nof objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to\neliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.\nThis paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework\nthat systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be\ncategorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency\nand mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the\naforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data\ngeneration. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data\npreparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,\nobjects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an\nvideo inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all\nobject-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for\nreference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to\nexplicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed\nthrough the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate\nthe model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new\nbenchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five\nspecial side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video\nobject erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios.

        "summary": "Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision\ntasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings\nfundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images\nthrough patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches\nlack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence\nbetween Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby\nlimiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.\nWe propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a\nmathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional\ncoordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly\nperiodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational\ninvariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the\nnon-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance\nrelationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct\nderivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs\nfrom their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nWEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including\n63.78\\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,\n93.28\\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on\nVTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay\nproperty through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization\nreveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus\ncompared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods\ndescribed in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.",

        "title": "Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?",
        "summary": "Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in\ncomputer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from\nlarge-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent\nlimitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and\nspatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for\nfine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and\nmultimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic\ndependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that\nnext-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,\ninstantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge\nsemantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this\nposition with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation\naction recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs\nwith lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves\nfine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,\ninterpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.\nImportantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also\nachieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under\npractical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for\nFM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level\nrelational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or\nregion organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols\nthat directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.",

        "summary": "3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot\ninteraction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then\nreconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving\nunedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative\nmodels, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs\nprecise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer\nfirst predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and\nkey-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing\nphase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the\ncorresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these\ncontextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of\npreserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the\nconsistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a\nhuman-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully\nlabeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of\npreserved regions and overall quality.

We then align the\nmesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In\ndetail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that\ndecouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,\nallowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We\nobserved that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation\noptimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between\ninput and target images.

However, many\nreal-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and\ntrack all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape\nfragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video\nsegmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and\nintroduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single\narchitecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.\nBuilt on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state\nand scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of\nAUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial\nspeedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS\n2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior\nuniversal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster\ntraining on 16-frame sequences.",

Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like\naudio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or\ncontext. To bridge this gap, \\textbf{we propose a framework designed to\ngenerate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also\nsemantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \\textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is\nbuilt upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large\nLanguage Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions\nthat provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion\ngenerator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production\nof actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure\nthe effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality\nconflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel\nPseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to\naccurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby\ngenerating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and\nlinguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves\nleading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync\naccuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with\ntextual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to\ncomplex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.\nHomepage: \\href{https://omnihuman-lab.github.io/v1_5/}",

Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of\nreconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor\ndata.

In\ncontrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models\noffers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In\nthis work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly\ngenerates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for\ncausal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry\nestimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and\nenvironment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image\npriors.

However, progressively manipulating certain\nattributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains\nchallenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.\nSome studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.\nHowever, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is\ntrained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new\nattribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy\naccumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical\napplications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this\nissue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes\nthe text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute\ndirections. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling\ninterpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.\nMoreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports\nzero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and\nthe composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving\nnotable improvements compared to previous methods.

As these\nmodels process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor\nRAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge\ndevices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by\ndirectly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional\ntwo-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple\nadaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE\n(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone\nProcessing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To\ncompensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation\npipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for\nlarge-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)\nLoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion\nmethods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.",

        "summary": "Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents\nthat span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or\nrely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first\nretrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from\nthis selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of\nincorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -\ntext-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -\nacross multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets\nMP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the\n\"concatenate-all-pages\" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant\nachieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An\nablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the\ngain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent\nworks to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts\naccuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring\nits practical value for real-world Document VQA.",

        "title": "Can we make NeRF-based visual localization privacy-preserving?",
        "summary": "Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known\nscene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the\nscene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of\nimages or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,\nNeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality\nnovel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising\nprivacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as\nsensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this\nchallenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess\nprivacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained\nwith photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry\nrepresentations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head\nthat predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving\nNeural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation\nsupervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a\nself-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable\nscene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space\nof ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding\nstate-of-the-art results.",

        "summary": "Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven\ngeneration as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,\nwhereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent\nantagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single\nframework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and\nre-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven\nresearch. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized\ncustomization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset\nconsisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized\ncontent images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that\nsimultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style\nthrough two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and\ncontent-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style\nreward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's\nperformance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly\nevaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject\nconsistency and style similarity.

Recently, the DETR-based framework\nhas been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries\nwith clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior\nworks have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague\nrepresentations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the\nHOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.\nTherefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object\nand interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with\nobject-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on\nhumans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we\ndesign a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates\nthat are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance\nthe initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's\nability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary\nPrediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.\nOur proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and\nthe V-COCO datasets.

        "summary": "Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential\nfor equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by\nvariations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models\n(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity\nattributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive\ndirections. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and\ntext modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and\nfairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal\nprompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal\nrepresentations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that\nseparates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned\nrepresentations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are\nconstructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to\nproduce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related\ninformation and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode\ndual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is\napplied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and\nstrengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight\nmedical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves\nstate-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution\nsettings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with\nonly 3.6M trainable parameters.

        "summary": "Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,\nparticularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which\nsynthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These\nmethods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the\ninherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video\nsequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To\naddress this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis\nvideo stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at\ntest time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues\navailable during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of\nthe output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant\nperformance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk\nlocalization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the\nadaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation\nsteps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the\nlongstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the\nmodern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical\napproaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate\nthe versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the\nperformance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and\nquantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.",

        "summary": "Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias\nin real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive\ndomains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,\nmodel generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social\ndiscrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing\ndebiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and\nneed extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between\nmodel fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we\npropose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that\nefficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with\nmuch less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external\ndataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to\nfirst find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to\nboth bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process\nupdates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its\ncontribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes\n(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray\ndatasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while\nachieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common\nfairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior\nperformance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.",

        "summary": "Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early\nvision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components\nwithin their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs\nsuggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand\nimages involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can\ngeneral-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do\nthey compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark\nthat can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as\nHICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their\nevaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is\npoorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple\nvalid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may\ncapture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted\nas either \"throwing\" or \"catching\". When only \"catching\" is annotated, the\nother, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact\nmatching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,\naffecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid\npredictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a\nmultiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only\nground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are\nconstructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when \"catching\" is annotated, \"throwing\"\nis not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The\nproposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI\nmethods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current\nstate of progress in HOI understanding.",

These findings indicate that domain\nshifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature\ndegradation.\n  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing\nunpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes\nSearcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision\nboundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature\nencoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of\nadaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through\noffline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single\ncomputation cycle.\n  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or\nsuperior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with\nmultimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including\nprotein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake\ndetection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and\ngeneralizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation\ntasks. .",

        "summary": "Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have\nadvanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,\nparticularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce\nwavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two\nlimitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,\nand (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while\nsuppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the\nfrequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for\nbetter channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior\nTransformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight\nkey spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)\nbottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention\nmechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped\narchitecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an\nSNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,\nEUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and\n0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in\nunderwater scenes.",

Inherently, it needs language understanding\nto bind a source concept with a target concept, in a way that preserves meaning\nwhile ensuring visual coherence. We propose a self-evaluating visual metaphor\ngeneration framework that focuses on metaphor alignment. Our self-evaluation\napproach combines existing metrics with our newly proposed metaphor\ndecomposition score and a meaning alignment (MA) metric. Within this setup, we\nexplore two novel approaches: a training-free pipeline that explicitly\ndecomposes prompts into source-target-meaning (S-T-M) mapping for image\nsynthesis, and a complementary training-based pipeline that improves alignment\nusing our proposed self-evaluation reward schema, without any large-scale\nretraining. On the held-out test set, the training-free approach surpasses\nstrong closed baselines (GPT-4o, Imagen) on decomposition, CLIP, and MA scores,\nwith the training-based approach close behind. We evaluate our framework output\nusing a user-facing study, and observed that participants preferred GPT-4o\noverall, while our training-free pipeline led open-source methods and edged\nImagen on abstract metaphors. Our analyses show S-T-M prompting helps longer or\nmore abstract metaphors, with closed models excelling on short, concrete cases;\nwe also observe sensitivity to sampler settings.

FastAvatar uses a novel\nencoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity\npreservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face\n``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.\nSecond, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and\npose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict\nresiduals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the\ntemplate 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,\nmodel inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms\nexisting feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction\nquality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,\nFlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent\nspace design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing\nwhich is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation\nframework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and\nspeed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in\nconsumer and interactive systems.",

        "summary": "Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects\nin RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.\nDespite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text\nembeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely\nignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant\nmapping the length with unit \"meter\" to \"decimeters\" or \"centimeters\" leads to\nsevere performance degradation, even though the physical length remains\nequivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained\nlanguage model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D\nperception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text\nembeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.\nFirstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),\nwhich enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different\nunits by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.\nNext, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further\nenhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into\ngeometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then\nleveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate\nthe proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the\nMono3DRefer dataset.

        "summary": "With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,\nmicroplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and\nliving organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These\nparticles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to\nhumans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown\nthat exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora\nimbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a\nnew model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with\nNile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for\nmicroplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real\nhuman blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human\nsamples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN\nmodel integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation\nusing a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic\nfragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for\nsegmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on\na dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an\naccuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an\nIntersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of\n90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent.

Prior attacks attempt to extend VLM output sequences by\noptimizing adversarial images, thereby increasing inference costs.

This trade-off between effectiveness and\nstealthiness poses a major limitation for existing attacks. To address this\nchallenge, we propose \\textit{Hidden Tail}, a stealthy resource consumption\nattack that crafts prompt-agnostic adversarial images, inducing VLMs to\ngenerate maximum-length outputs by appending special tokens invisible to users.\nOur method employs a composite loss function that balances semantic\npreservation, repetitive special token induction, and suppression of the\nend-of-sequence (EOS) token, optimized via a dynamic weighting strategy.\nExtensive experiments show that \\textit{Hidden Tail} outperforms existing\nattacks, increasing output length by up to 19.2$\\times$ and reaching the\nmaximum token limit, while preserving attack stealthiness.

Electromagnetic communication and\nsensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and\ntransfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the\ncreation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these\nissue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that\nbridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality.

        "summary": "Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned\ntraining-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain\nshifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the\nmodel to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the\ntraining and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world\nscenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade\nclosed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data\nduring adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,\nthe previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in\nsuboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we\nfound that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test\nstreams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for\nfiltering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering\n(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the\nprimary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),\nwhich calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model\nto integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA.

An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is\nintroduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and\na novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first\nextracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which\ncaptures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained\nlocalization cues.

Finally, an ensemble-based\ngenetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)\nis employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically\nbalancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity\nreduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse\nand discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to\nachieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental\nresults on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as\nocclusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,\ndemonstrate good performance. The proposed approach achieves 99.65% recognition\naccuracy, reduces features to as few as 7, and enhances inference time.

        "summary": "Temporal context is essential for robotic manipulation because such tasks are\ninherently non-Markovian, yet mainstream VLA models typically overlook it and\nstruggle with long-horizon, temporally dependent tasks. Cognitive science\nsuggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived\nrepresentations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves\nverbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term\nmemory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a\nCognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A\npretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens\nthat form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores\nlow-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory\nretrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with\ncurrent tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these\ntokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware\naction sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks\nacross three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it\nachieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on\nBridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon\ntemporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon\ntasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.

        "summary": "We present a topological framework for analysing neural time series that\nintegrates Transfer Entropy (TE) with directed Persistent Homology (PH) to\ncharacterize information flow in spiking neural systems. TE quantifies\ndirectional influence between neurons, producing weighted, directed graphs that\nreflect dynamic interactions. These graphs are then analyzed using PH, enabling\nassessment of topological complexity across multiple structural scales and\ndimensions.\n  We apply this TE+PH pipeline to synthetic spiking networks trained on logic\ngate tasks, image-classification networks exposed to structured and perturbed\ninputs, and mouse cortical recordings annotated with behavioral events. Across\nall settings, the resulting topological signatures reveal distinctions in task\ncomplexity, stimulus structure, and behavioral regime. Higher-dimensional\nfeatures become more prominent in complex or noisy conditions, reflecting\ninteraction patterns that extend beyond pairwise connectivity. Our findings\noffer a principled approach to mapping directed information flow onto global\norganizational patterns in both artificial and biological neural systems. The\nframework is generalizable and interpretable, making it well suited for neural\nsystems with time-resolved and binary spiking data.",

        "summary": "Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.\nAlthough end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,\ninterpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban\nscenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with\nnon-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind\nAI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability\nwhile optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we\npropose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by\ngenerating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us\nto explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We\nconduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and\nvalidate our method on the CARLA benchmarks.

However, deploying these\nsystems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant\nchallenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This\npaper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized\nfor low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart\nrate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial\nvideo streams.

This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames\nper second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface\nto guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both\nan HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand\nvital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of\nlow-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional\nReactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven\nprocessing and efficient task parallelization.

        "summary": "Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from\noverfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor\ngeneralization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting\ntraining samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,\nmethods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and\ngeneralization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not\nstraightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms\ntend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample\ndifficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we\npropose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial\nvulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward\nflat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective\nas training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by\nmeasuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We\nincorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample\ndifficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,\nfine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate\nthat our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming\nexisting curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.",

        "summary": "Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into\nsequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens\nsequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably\nreuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each\nvertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long\ntoken sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose\nan efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and\nfaces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an\nautoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count\nto approximately 23\\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.\nNext, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single\nstep by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency\nmatrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,\nwe introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural\narrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge\nconnections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than\n8$\\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art\napproaches, while producing higher mesh quality.",

In this\nwork, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a\ntopology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more\ncomplex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware\nloss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes\nstructural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges.

Traditional methods for\ngenerating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting\nrobots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and\nsafety.

Our approach\nnot only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated\nwith real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of\nadvanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.\nTo support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled\nindoor and unstructured outdoor environments.

While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail\nto meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.\nExisting approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and\nstruggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world\nmanufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed\nsupervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we\npropose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model\nbuilt on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel\nsynthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an\nimproved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four\nsupervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging\nall available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for\nperformance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four\nchallenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an\ninference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision\nparadigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet\nrepresents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing\nchallenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial\napplications.

Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic\nconstraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\\'ezier curves\nis adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show\nthat the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting\nfrom 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent\nGraph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in\ncompletely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient\nreal-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF\nand Dynamic APPATT algorithms.",

Although recent approaches have\nadopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,\ninterval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,\nleaving the issue only partially mitigated.

        "summary": "National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest\ninformation, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,\nmaintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.\nRemote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,\noffer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While\nthe use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing\ntree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches\nrely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and\nphenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained\nremote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These\npre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for\ngeneral-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with\nsmaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work\nsystematically investigates how deep features improve tree species\nclassification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,\nwe extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites\ndata and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that\nfine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the\nNetherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This\ndemonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for\nthis task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for\ndata-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly\navailable satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly\nimproves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can\neffectively complement existing forest inventory processes.",

To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,\nan extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is\na regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the\ntraining loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding\nlevel, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a\nclass-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it\nsuppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning\nfor minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image\nclassification.

        "summary": "Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to\nnavigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,\nmanually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing\nrobust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the\nperformance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging\nlong-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not\nscalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce\nDoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions\nfor LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth\nannotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where\nDoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar\nDoppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware\nassociation and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN\nTruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised\nmethods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve\nover 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth\ndata.

We present an evaluation of how visualizing the target object with\ndifferent transparencies and visualizing a tracked tool (virtual proxy vs. real\ntool vs. no tool tracking) affects depth perception and system usability. Ten\nparticipants performed two experiments on HoloLens 2. In Experiment 1, we\ncompared high-transparency vs. low-transparency target rendering in a depth\nmatching task at arm's length. In Experiment 2, participants performed a\nsimulated surgical pinpoint task on a frontal bone target under six\nvisualization conditions ($2 \\times 3$: two target transparencies and three\ntool visualization modes: virtual tool hologram, real tool, or no tool\ntracking). We collected data on depth matching error, target localization\nerror, system usability, task workload, and qualitative feedback. Results show\nthat a more opaque target yields significantly lower depth estimation error\nthan a highly transparent target at arm's distance. Moreover, showing the real\ntool (occluding the virtual target) led to the highest accuracy and usability\nwith the lowest workload, while not tracking the tool yielded the worst\nperformance and user ratings. However, making the target highly transparent,\nwhile allowing the real tool to remain visible, slightly impaired depth cues\nand did not improve usability. Our findings underscore that correct occlusion\ncues, rendering virtual content opaque and occluding it with real tools in real\ntime, are critical for depth perception and precision in OST-AR.

To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a\nSpecialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering\n(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image\nclassifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic\npredictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the\nGeneralist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In\nour framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's\nreasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further\nenhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the\nGeneralist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both\naccuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic\nerrors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on\nour curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an\n18\\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a\nfine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM\nrequirement and latency by at least 20\\% and 5\\%, respectively.

After rigorously\nformulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements\nof these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP\nlandscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face\nembeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,\nmodularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in\nterms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and\nunlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted\nusing EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a\nreal-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.\nMoreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its\nevaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\ntime that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and\nfor fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan\nto release our code",

        "summary": "Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such\nas cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear\nstress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine\nlearning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid\nsimulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets\nto effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means\nof self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of\ngeometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging\nlearned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet\nbeen well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a\nlarge dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels\ncan benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a\nsmall-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target\nfor the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity\nobtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the\nshapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can\nboost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high\n(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.",

        "summary": "MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize\npatient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI\nacquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and\nincreased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial\nresearch effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI\nacquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the\nfully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly\nreconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary\ngoal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing\ninterest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated\nMRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed\nin isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or\nprivate datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no\nhigh-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal\nstrategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper\nprovides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI\ndata comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing\n\\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation\ninto a unified model, with \\textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize\nestablished MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We\ntest these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as\nwell as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple\ntwo-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation\nscores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically\nfor this task.",

By\nsegmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a\nTransformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and\nisolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.\nTo prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework\nincorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization\nmetrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and\nheatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types\noccupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,\nmotion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are\ndesigned to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.\nFurthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,\nsingle-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different\ninteraction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the\nclassification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork\nfor scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200\nframes.

Efficient identification of such points is important to\nclient-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map\ncue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable\nSpatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and\nselecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the\ndesigner-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,\nfrom a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce\na two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using\nFaster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses\nlocal and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient\nadapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.\nOur primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set\nbaseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,\ndiverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a\nkey trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection\nwith sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and\neffective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task.

        "summary": "Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing\nthree-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from\nairborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of\ncurrent approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or\nlearned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering\nstrategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually\ndesigned features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better\nthan the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based\napproaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not\ntruly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second\nis that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,\nleading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric\ncharacteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network\ntraining. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,\nnamed RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds\nin a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer\nencoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance\nmasks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the\nsegmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module\n(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to\nenhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,\nwe propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the\ninfluence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss\nto constrain the network training.",

Our approach\nleverages a ConvNeXt V2 base model with center cropping preprocessing and\n5-fold cross-validation ensemble strategy. The method addresses key challenges\nincluding severe class imbalance, high morphological variability, and domain\nheterogeneity across different tumor types, species, and scanners. Through\nstrategic preprocessing with 60% center cropping and mixed precision training,\nour model achieved robust performance on the diverse MIDOG 2025 dataset. The\nsolution demonstrates the effectiveness of modern convolutional architectures\nfor mitotic figure subtyping while maintaining computational efficiency through\ncareful architectural choices and training optimizations.",

        "summary": "Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in\nechocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to\nprovide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection\nFraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good\nsegmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.\nIn this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network\n(\\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation\naccuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.\nThe network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using\nconvolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,\nwhile high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture\nspatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame\nand multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation\nwhen relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only\nmulti-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the\nSpatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context\nthrough skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate\nEF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.",

        "summary": "Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse\nmedical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods\nprimarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and\nperforming fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based\n(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key\nchallenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to\nmodel over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic\nfusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert\nnetwork handles separate decoupled features, which limits information\ninteraction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which\ndevises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling\nand dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the\ndiversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization\nability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of\ninformation closure and helps expert networks better capture information among\ndecoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention\nnetwork within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation\nquality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house\nLiver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the\neffectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.",

        "summary": "Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when\ndealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such\nas super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these\nlow-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and\ncomputational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to\ncases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we\nintroduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687\nannotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span\na wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality\nlevels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and\nLP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and\nillegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible\nLPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image\nrecognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires\nsuper-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which\nremained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),\ntogether with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the\ndifficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research.
