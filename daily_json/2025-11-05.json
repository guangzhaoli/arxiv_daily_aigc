        "summary": "We present PercHead, a method for single-image 3D head reconstruction and\nsemantic 3D editing - two tasks that are inherently challenging due to severe\nview occlusions, weak perceptual supervision, and the ambiguity of editing in\n3D space. We develop a unified base model for reconstructing view-consistent 3D\nheads from a single input image. The model employs a dual-branch encoder\nfollowed by a ViT-based decoder that lifts 2D features into 3D space through\niterative cross-attention. Rendering is performed using Gaussian Splatting. At\nthe heart of our approach is a novel perceptual supervision strategy based on\nDINOv2 and SAM2.1, which provides rich, generalized signals for both geometric\nand appearance fidelity. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in\nnovel-view synthesis and, furthermore, exhibits exceptional robustness to\nextreme viewing angles compared to established baselines. Furthermore, this\nbase model can be seamlessly extended for semantic 3D editing by swapping the\nencoder and finetuning the network. In this variant, we disentangle geometry\nand style through two distinct input modalities: a segmentation map to control\ngeometry and either a text prompt or a reference image to specify appearance.\nWe highlight the intuitive and powerful 3D editing capabilities of our model\nthrough a lightweight, interactive GUI, where users can effortlessly sculpt\ngeometry by drawing segmentation maps and stylize appearance via natural\nlanguage or image prompts.\n  Project Page: https://antoniooroz.github.io/PercHead Video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hFybgTk4kE",

        "title": "Dynamic Reflections: Probing Video Representations with Text Alignment",
        "summary": "The alignment of representations from different modalities has recently been\nshown to provide insights on the structural similarities and downstream\ncapabilities of different encoders across diverse data types. While significant\nprogress has been made in aligning images with text, the temporal nature of\nvideo data remains largely unexplored in this context. In this work, we conduct\nthe first comprehensive study of video-text representation alignment, probing\nthe capabilities of modern video and language encoders. Our findings reveal\nseveral key insights. First, we demonstrate that cross-modal alignment highly\ndepends on the richness of both visual (static images vs. multi-frame videos)\nand text (single caption vs. a collection) data provided at test time,\nespecially when using state-of-the-art video encoders. We propose parametric\ntest-time scaling laws that capture this behavior and show remarkable\npredictive power against empirical observations. Secondly, we investigate the\ncorrelation between semantic alignment and performance on both semantic and\nnon-semantic downstream tasks, providing initial evidence that strong alignment\nagainst text encoders may be linked to general-purpose video representation and\nunderstanding. Finally, we correlate temporal reasoning with cross-modal\nalignment providing a challenging test-bed for vision and language models.\nOverall, our work introduces video-text alignment as an informative zero-shot\nway to probe the representation power of different encoders for spatio-temporal\ndata.

        "summary": "Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) underpin many modern computer vision\nsystems. With applications ranging from common to critical areas, a need to\nexplain and understand the model and its decisions (XAI) emerged. Prior works\nsuggest that in the top layers of CNNs, the individual channels can be\nattributed to classifying human-understandable concepts. Concept relevance\npropagation (CRP) methods can backtrack predictions to these channels and find\nimages that most activate these channels. However, current CRP workflows are\nlargely manual: experts must inspect activation images to name the discovered\nconcepts and must synthesize verbose explanations from relevance maps, limiting\nthe accessibility of the explanations and their scalability.\n  To address these issues, we introduce Large Language model EXplaIns COncept\nRelevance Propagation (LLEXICORP), a modular pipeline that couples CRP with a\nmultimodal large language model. Our approach automatically assigns descriptive\nnames to concept prototypes and generates natural-language explanations that\ntranslate quantitative relevance distributions into intuitive narratives. To\nensure faithfulness, we craft prompts that teach the language model the\nsemantics of CRP through examples and enforce a separation between naming and\nexplanation tasks. The resulting text can be tailored to different audiences,\noffering low-level technical descriptions for experts and high-level summaries\nfor non-technical stakeholders.\n  We qualitatively evaluate our method on various images from ImageNet on a\nVGG16 model. Our findings suggest that integrating concept-based attribution\nmethods with large language models can significantly lower the barrier to\ninterpreting deep neural networks, paving the way for more transparent AI\nsystems.",

While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion\nanalysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges.\nEmotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it\ndifficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable\nrationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided\nreasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression\nanalysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the\ncore of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo),\nspecifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These\nmodels undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning\nfor injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement\nlearning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data\ninfrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG)\nconsisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples.

The intermediate feature representations are usually create by\ngenerating intermediate images (kind of data enhancement), or fusing\nintermediate features (more parameters, lack of interpretability), and they do\nnot make good use of the intermediate features. Thus, we propose a novel\nVI-ReID framework via Modality-Transition Representation Learning (MTRL) with a\nmiddle generated image as a transmitter from visible to infrared modals, which\nare fully aligned with the original visible images and similar to the infrared\nmodality.

Surprisingly, the nnU Net model trained on the initial 60 instances\nperformed better than the network trained on an offline-augmented dataset of\n360 cases.

While recent high performance models and high quality datasets\nhave significantly advanced the field, a critical limitation persists. Current\nmodels typically acquire limited knowledge from single-type annotated data and\ncannot concurrently leverage diverse binary change detection (BCD) and semantic\nchange detection (SCD) datasets. This constraint leads to poor generalization\nand limited versatility. The recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) introduce new possibilities for a unified CD framework. We\nleverage the language priors and unification capabilities of MLLMs to develop\nUniChange, the first MLLM-based unified change detection model.

Recently,\na breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across\ndiverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the\nclinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can\nimprove performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or\nrequire fully supervised segmentations for training.

Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image\nannotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality\nscores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on\nhumerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from\nTotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement\nmethods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation\ntime.

By disentangling and leveraging features from early visual\ncortex, ventral, and dorsal streams, VCFlow captures diverse and complementary\ncognitive information essential for visual reconstruction. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a feature-level contrastive learning strategy to enhance the\nextraction of subject-invariant semantic representations, thereby enhancing\nsubject-agnostic applicability to previously unseen subjects. Unlike\nconventional pipelines that need more than 12 hours of per-subject data and\nheavy computation, VCFlow sacrifices only 7\\% accuracy on average yet generates\neach reconstructed video in 10 seconds without any retraining, offering a fast\nand clinically scalable solution.

        "summary": "Video-based person re-identification (ReID) in cross-view domains (for\nexample, aerial-ground surveillance) remains an open problem because of extreme\nviewpoint shifts, scale disparities, and temporal inconsistencies. To address\nthese challenges, we propose MTF-CVReID, a parameter-efficient framework that\nintroduces seven complementary modules over a ViT-B/16 backbone. Specifically,\nwe include: (1) Cross-Stream Feature Normalization (CSFN) to correct camera and\nview biases; (2) Multi-Resolution Feature Harmonization (MRFH) for scale\nstabilization across altitudes; (3) Identity-Aware Memory Module (IAMM) to\nreinforce persistent identity traits; (4) Temporal Dynamics Modeling (TDM) for\nmotion-aware short-term temporal encoding; (5) Inter-View Feature Alignment\n(IVFA) for perspective-invariant representation alignment; (6) Hierarchical\nTemporal Pattern Learning (HTPL) to capture multi-scale temporal regularities;\nand (7) Multi-View Identity Consistency Learning (MVICL) that enforces\ncross-view identity coherence using a contrastive learning paradigm. Despite\nadding only about 2 million parameters and 0.7 GFLOPs over the baseline,\nMTF-CVReID maintains real-time efficiency (189 FPS) and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the AG-VPReID benchmark across all altitude\nlevels, with strong cross-dataset generalization to G2A-VReID and MARS\ndatasets.

The dataset comprises 26,646 high-resolution (1080p) images sampled from\n2800 Bengaluru's Safe-City CCTV cameras over a 4-week period, and subsequently\nannotated through a crowdsourced hackathon involving 565 college students from\nacross India. In total, 1.8 million bounding boxes were labeled across 14\nvehicle classes specific to India: Cycle, 2-Wheeler (Motorcycle), 3-Wheeler\n(Auto-rickshaw), LCV (Light Commercial Vehicles), Van, Tempo-traveller,\nHatchback, Sedan, SUV, MUV, Mini-bus, Bus, Truck and Other. Of these, 283k-316k\nconsensus ground truth bounding boxes and labels were derived for distinct\nobjects in the 26k images using Majority Voting and STAPLE algorithms. Further,\nwe train multiple contemporary detectors, including YOLO11-S/X, RT-DETR-S/X,\nand DAMO-YOLO-T/L using these datasets, and report accuracy based on mAP50,\nmAP75 and mAP50:95. Models trained on UVH-26 achieve 8.4-31.5% improvements in\nmAP50:95 over equivalent baseline models trained on COCO dataset, with\nRT-DETR-X showing the best performance at 0.67 (mAP50:95) as compared to 0.40\nfor COCO-trained weights for common classes (Car, Bus, and Truck). This\ndemonstrates the benefits of domain-specific training data for Indian traffic\nscenarios. The release package provides the 26k images with consensus\nannotations based on Majority Voting (UVH-26-MV) and STAPLE (UVH-26-ST) and the\n6 fine-tuned YOLO and DETR models on each of these datasets. By capturing the\nheterogeneity of Indian urban mobility directly from operational traffic-camera\nstreams, UVH-26 addresses a critical gap in existing global benchmarks, and\noffers a foundation for advancing detection, classification, and deployment of\nintelligent transportation systems in emerging nations with complex traffic\nconditions.",

To reduce reliance on labeled data and manual evaluation, this\nstudy explores unsupervised learning methods for automated anomaly detection in\nshearographic images. Three architectures are evaluated: a fully connected\nautoencoder, a convolutional autoencoder, and a student-teacher feature\nmatching model. All models are trained solely on defect-free data. A controlled\ndataset was developed using a custom specimen with reproducible defect\npatterns, enabling systematic acquisition of shearographic measurements under\nboth ideal and realistic deformation conditions. Two training subsets were\ndefined: one containing only undistorted, defect-free samples, and one\nadditionally including globally deformed, yet defect-free, data. The latter\nsimulates practical inspection conditions by incorporating deformation-induced\nfringe patterns that may obscure localized anomalies. The models are evaluated\nin terms of binary classification and, for the student-teacher model, spatial\ndefect localization. Results show that the student-teacher approach achieves\nsuperior classification robustness and enables precise localization. Compared\nto the autoencoder-based models, it demonstrates improved separability of\nfeature representations, as visualized through t-SNE embeddings.

Traditionally, this process has been\nmanually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video\nediting technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often\nfail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly. To\naddress this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for\nvideo shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching\nbetween the script generated by a large language model and a video library to\nobtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we\nsegment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such\nas shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models\nto learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their\nalignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization\nby combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the\nassembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the\narrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic,\nnarrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style\nof reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual\nexpression.

However, adapting these general-purpose models for\nspecialized scientific tasks is critical, and the optimal domain adaptation\nstrategy is often unclear. To address this, we introduce PtychoBench, a new\nmulti-modal, multi-task benchmark for ptychographic analysis. Using this\nbenchmark, we systematically compare two specialization strategies: Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) and In-Context Learning (ICL). We evaluate these strategies\non a visual artifact detection task with VLMs and a textual parameter\nrecommendation task with LLMs in a data-scarce regime. Our findings reveal that\nthe optimal specialization pathway is task-dependent. For the visual task, SFT\nand ICL are highly complementary, with a fine-tuned model guided by\ncontext-aware examples achieving the highest mean performance (Micro-F1 of\n0.728). Conversely, for the textual task, ICL on a large base model is the\nsuperior strategy, reaching a peak Micro-F1 of 0.847 and outperforming a\npowerful \"super-expert\" SFT model (0-shot Micro-F1 of 0.839). We also confirm\nthe superiority of context-aware prompting and identify a consistent contextual\ninterference phenomenon in fine-tuned models. These results, benchmarked\nagainst strong baselines including GPT-4o and a DINOv3-based classifier, offer\nkey observations for AI in science: the optimal specialization path in our\nbenchmark is dependent on the task modality, offering a clear framework for\ndeveloping more effective science-based agentic systems.",

DetectiumFire offers\nclear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data\nquality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world\nscenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks,\nincluding object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and\nvision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset\nto advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent\nsafety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire\nunderstanding in the AI community.

        "summary": "With the rapid growth of the low-altitude economy, UAVs have become crucial\nfor measurement and tracking in patrol systems. However, in GNSS-denied areas,\nsatellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents\na cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object\ndetection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view,\nheterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual\nlocalization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are\nextracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is\nestimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because\npublicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches\nrecast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these\ndatasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain\ndifferences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations,\nor generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment,\ncontent loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object\ndetection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite\nimages, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and\nintra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based\nnode-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization\nperformance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that\nour approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and\ngeneralizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps,\nsuch as infrared-visible image matching.

To address this gap, OLATverse\noffers two key advantages over existing datasets: large-scale coverage of real\nobjects and high-fidelity appearance under precisely controlled illuminations.\nSpecifically, OLATverse contains 765 common and uncommon real-world objects,\nspanning a wide range of material categories. Each object is captured using 35\nDSLR cameras and 331 individually controlled light sources, enabling the\nsimulation of diverse illumination conditions. In addition, for each object, we\nprovide well-calibrated camera parameters, accurate object masks, photometric\nsurface normals, and diffuse albedo as auxiliary resources. We also construct\nan extensive evaluation set, establishing the first comprehensive real-world\nobject-centric benchmark for inverse rendering and normal estimation.

        "summary": "Multi-view action recognition aims to recognize human actions using multiple\ncamera views and deals with occlusion caused by obstacles or crowds. In this\ntask, cooperation among views, which generates a joint representation by\ncombining multiple views, is vital. Previous studies have explored promising\ncooperation methods for improving performance. However, since their methods\nfocus only on the task setting of recognizing a single action from an entire\nvideo, they are not applicable to the recently popular spatio-temporal action\nrecognition~(STAR) setting, in which each person's action is recognized\nsequentially. To address this problem, this paper proposes a multi-view action\nrecognition method for the STAR setting, called MVAFormer. In MVAFormer, we\nintroduce a novel transformer-based cooperation module among views. In contrast\nto previous studies, which utilize embedding vectors with lost spatial\ninformation, our module utilizes the feature map for effective cooperation in\nthe STAR setting, which preserves the spatial information. Furthermore, in our\nmodule, we divide the self-attention for the same and different views to model\nthe relationship between multiple views effectively. The results of experiments\nusing a newly collected dataset demonstrate that MVAFormer outperforms the\ncomparison baselines by approximately $4.4$ points on the F-measure.",

        "summary": "Mobile eye tracking plays a vital role in capturing human visual attention\nacross both real-world and extended reality (XR) environments, making it an\nessential tool for applications ranging from behavioural research to\nhuman-computer interaction. However, missing values due to blinks, pupil\ndetection errors, or illumination changes pose significant challenges for\nfurther gaze data analysis. To address this challenge, we introduce HAGI++ - a\nmulti-modal diffusion-based approach for gaze data imputation that, for the\nfirst time, uses the integrated head orientation sensors to exploit the\ninherent correlation between head and eye movements. HAGI++ employs a\ntransformer-based diffusion model to learn cross-modal dependencies between eye\nand head representations and can be readily extended to incorporate additional\nbody movements. Extensive evaluations on the large-scale Nymeria, Ego-Exo4D,\nand HOT3D datasets demonstrate that HAGI++ consistently outperforms\nconventional interpolation methods and deep learning-based time-series\nimputation baselines in gaze imputation. Furthermore, statistical analyses\nconfirm that HAGI++ produces gaze velocity distributions that closely match\nactual human gaze behaviour, ensuring more realistic gaze imputations.\nMoreover, by incorporating wrist motion captured from commercial wearable\ndevices, HAGI++ surpasses prior methods that rely on full-body motion capture\nin the extreme case of 100% missing gaze data (pure gaze generation). Our\nmethod paves the way for more complete and accurate eye gaze recordings in\nreal-world settings and has significant potential for enhancing gaze-based\nanalysis and interaction across various application domains.",

        "title": "A Novel Grouping-Based Hybrid Color Correction Algorithm for Color Point Clouds",
        "summary": "Color consistency correction for color point clouds is a fundamental yet\nimportant task in 3D rendering and compression applications. In the past, most\nprevious color correction methods aimed at correcting color for color images.\nThe purpose of this paper is to propose a grouping-based hybrid color\ncorrection algorithm for color point clouds. Our algorithm begins by estimating\nthe overlapping rate between the aligned source and target point clouds, and\nthen adaptively partitions the target points into two groups, namely the close\nproximity group Gcl and the moderate proximity group Gmod, or three groups,\nnamely Gcl, Gmod, and the distant proximity group Gdist, when the estimated\noverlapping rate is low or high, respectively. To correct color for target\npoints in Gcl, a K-nearest neighbors based bilateral interpolation (KBI) method\nis proposed. To correct color for target points in Gmod, a joint KBI and the\nhistogram equalization (JKHE) method is proposed. For target points in Gdist, a\nhistogram equalization (HE) method is proposed for color correction. Finally,\nwe discuss the grouping-effect free property and the ablation study in our\nalgorithm. The desired color consistency correction benefit of our algorithm\nhas been justified through 1086 testing color point cloud pairs against the\nstate-of-the-art methods. The C++ source code of our algorithm can be accessed\nfrom the website: https://github.com/ivpml84079/Point-cloud-color-correction.",

        "summary": "Moving object segmentation is a crucial task for safe and reliable autonomous\nmobile systems like self-driving cars, improving the reliability and robustness\nof subsequent tasks like SLAM or path planning. While the segmentation of\ncamera or LiDAR data is widely researched and achieves great results, it often\nintroduces an increased latency by requiring the accumulation of temporal\nsequences to gain the necessary temporal context. Radar sensors overcome this\nproblem with their ability to provide a direct measurement of a point's Doppler\nvelocity, which can be exploited for single-scan moving object segmentation.\nHowever, radar point clouds are often sparse and noisy, making data annotation\nfor use in supervised learning very tedious, time-consuming, and\ncost-intensive. To overcome this problem, we address the task of\nself-supervised moving object segmentation of sparse and noisy radar point\nclouds. We follow a two-step approach of contrastive self-supervised\nrepresentation learning with subsequent supervised fine-tuning using limited\namounts of annotated data. We propose a novel clustering-based contrastive loss\nfunction with cluster refinement based on dynamic points removal to pretrain\nthe network to produce motion-aware representations of the radar data. Our\nmethod improves label efficiency after fine-tuning, effectively boosting\nstate-of-the-art performance by self-supervised pretraining.",

        "summary": "Large-scale chemical reaction datasets are crucial for AI research in\nchemistry. However, existing chemical reaction data often exist as images\nwithin papers, making them not machine-readable and unusable for training\nmachine learning models. In response to this challenge, we propose the\nRxnCaption framework for the task of chemical Reaction Diagram Parsing (RxnDP).\nOur framework reformulates the traditional coordinate prediction driven parsing\nprocess into an image captioning problem, which Large Vision-Language Models\n(LVLMs) handle naturally. We introduce a strategy termed \"BBox and Index as\nVisual Prompt\" (BIVP), which uses our state-of-the-art molecular detector,\nMolYOLO, to pre-draw molecular bounding boxes and indices directly onto the\ninput image. This turns the downstream parsing into a natural-language\ndescription problem. Extensive experiments show that the BIVP strategy\nsignificantly improves structural extraction quality while simplifying model\ndesign. We further construct the RxnCaption-11k dataset, an order of magnitude\nlarger than prior real-world literature benchmarks, with a balanced test subset\nacross four layout archetypes. Experiments demonstrate that RxnCaption-VL\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.

        "title": "NEF-NET+: Adapting Electrocardio panorama in the wild",
        "summary": "Conventional multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) systems capture cardiac\nsignals from a fixed set of anatomical viewpoints defined by lead placement.\nHowever, certain cardiac conditions (e.g., Brugada syndrome) require\nadditional, non-standard viewpoints to reveal diagnostically critical patterns\nthat may be absent in standard leads. To systematically overcome this\nlimitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced to reconstruct a continuous\nelectrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from\narbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama). Despite its promise, Nef-Net\noperates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild challenges, such as\nlong-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific signal artifacts, and\nsuboptimal lead placement calibration. This paper presents NEF-NET+, an\nenhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that supports\narbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across ECG\ndevices, and com- pensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode\nplacement. These capabilities are enabled by a newly designed model\narchitecture that performs direct view transformation, incorporating a workflow\ncomprising offline pretraining, device calibration tuning steps as well as an\non-the-fly calibration step for patient-specific adaptation. To rigorously\nevaluate panoramic ECG synthesis, we construct a new Electrocardio Panorama\nbenchmark, called Panobench, comprising 5367 recordings with 48-view per\nsubject, capturing the full spatial variability of cardiac electrical activity.\nExperimental results show that NEF-NET+ delivers substantial improvements over\nNef-Net, yielding an increase of around 6 dB in PSNR in real-world setting. The\ncode and Panobench will be released in a subsequent publication.",

        "summary": "In human cognition, there exist numerous thought processes that are tacit and\nbeyond verbal expression, enabling us to understand and interact with the world\nin multiple ways. However, contemporary Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain\nconstrained to reasoning within the discrete and rigid space of linguistic\ntokens, thereby bottlenecking the rich, high-dimensional nature of visual\nperception. To bridge this gap, we propose CoCoVa (Chain of Continuous\nVision-Language Thought), a novel framework for vision-language model that\nleverages continuous cross-modal reasoning for diverse vision-language tasks.\nThe core of CoCoVa is an iterative reasoning cycle, where a novel Latent\nQ-Former (LQ-Former) acts as a dynamic reasoning engine, iteratively refining a\nchain of latent thought vectors through cross-modal fusion. To focus this\nprocess, a token selection mechanism dynamically identifies salient visual\nregions, mimicking attentional focus. To ensure these latent thoughts remain\ngrounded, we train the model with a multi-task objective that combines\ncontrastive learning and diffusion-based reconstruction, enforcing alignment\nbetween latent representations and both visual and textual modalities.\nEvaluations show CoCoVa improves accuracy and token efficiency over strong\nbaselines. With a 1.5B backbone, it competes with or surpasses larger 7B-9B\nmodels on almost all benchmarks. When scaled to 7B LLM backbones, it remains\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art models. Qualitative analysis validates that\nlearned latent space captures interpretable and structured reasoning patterns,\nhighlighting the potential of CoCoVa to bridge the representational gap between\ndiscrete language processing and the continuous nature of visual understanding.",

Existing post-hoc\nOOD detection methods detect OOD samples by leveraging their features and\nlogits information without retraining. However, they often overlook the\ninherent correlation between features and logits, which is crucial for\neffective OOD detection. To address this limitation, we propose Global-Aware\nFeature Decoupling with Confidence Calibration (GAFD-CC). GAFD-CC aims to\nrefine decision boundaries and increase discriminative performance. Firstly, it\nperforms global-aware feature decoupling guided by classification weights. This\ninvolves aligning features with the direction of global classification weights\nto decouple them. From this, GAFD-CC extracts two types of critical\ninformation: positively correlated features that promote in-distribution\n(ID)/OOD boundary refinement and negatively correlated features that suppress\nfalse positives and tighten these boundaries. Secondly, it adaptively fuses\nthese decoupled features with multi-scale logit-based confidence for\ncomprehensive and robust OOD detection. Extensive experiments on large-scale\nbenchmarks demonstrate GAFD-CC's competitive performance and strong\ngeneralization ability compared to those of state-of-the-art methods.",

Isomorphic to spatial rotation,\n3D pose has been parameterized in a number of ways, either in or out of the\ncontext of parameter estimation. We explore the idea that Euler angles, despite\ntheir shortcomings, may lead to useful models in a number of aspects, compared\nto a model built on a more complex parameterisation.",

        "summary": "Medical Report Generation (MRG) is a key part of modern medical diagnostics,\nas it automatically generates reports from radiological images to reduce\nradiologists' burden. However, reliable MRG models for lesion description face\nthree main challenges: insufficient domain knowledge understanding, poor\ntext-visual entity embedding alignment, and spurious correlations from\ncross-modal biases. Previous work only addresses single challenges, while this\npaper tackles all three via a novel hierarchical task decomposition approach,\nproposing the HTSC-CIF framework. HTSC-CIF classifies the three challenges into\nlow-, mid-, and high-level tasks: 1) Low-level: align medical entity features\nwith spatial locations to enhance domain knowledge for visual encoders; 2)\nMid-level: use Prefix Language Modeling (text) and Masked Image Modeling\n(images) to boost cross-modal alignment via mutual guidance; 3) High-level: a\ncross-modal causal intervention module (via front-door intervention) to reduce\nconfounders and improve interpretability. Extensive experiments confirm\nHTSC-CIF's effectiveness, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nMRG methods. Code will be made public upon paper acceptance.",

        "summary": "Monocular depth estimation (MDE) is a critical task to guide autonomous\nmedical robots. However, obtaining absolute (metric) depth from an endoscopy\ncamera in surgical scenes is difficult, which limits supervised learning of\ndepth on real endoscopic images. Current image-level unsupervised domain\nadaptation methods translate synthetic images with known depth maps into the\nstyle of real endoscopic frames and train depth networks using these translated\nimages with their corresponding depth maps. However a domain gap often remains\nbetween real and translated synthetic images. In this paper, we present a\nlatent feature alignment method to improve absolute depth estimation by\nreducing this domain gap in the context of endoscopic videos of the central\nairway. Our methods are agnostic to the image translation process and focus on\nthe depth estimation itself. Specifically, the depth network takes translated\nsynthetic and real endoscopic frames as input and learns latent\ndomain-invariant features via adversarial learning and directional feature\nconsistency. The evaluation is conducted on endoscopic videos of central airway\nphantoms with manually aligned absolute depth maps. Compared to\nstate-of-the-art MDE methods, our approach achieves superior performance on\nboth absolute and relative depth metrics, and consistently improves results\nacross various backbones and pretrained weights.

Recent studies on\nmultimodal neuroimaging fusion using MRI and PET have achieved promising\nresults by integrating multi-scale complementary features. However, most\nexisting approaches primarily emphasize cross-modal complementarity while\noverlooking the diagnostic importance of modality-specific features. In\naddition, the inherent distributional differences between modalities often lead\nto biased and noisy representations, degrading classification performance. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a Collaborative Attention and\nConsistent-Guided Fusion framework for MRI and PET based AD diagnosis. The\nproposed model introduces a learnable parameter representation (LPR) block to\ncompensate for missing modality information, followed by a shared encoder and\nmodality-independent encoders to preserve both shared and specific\nrepresentations. Furthermore, a consistency-guided mechanism is employed to\nexplicitly align the latent distributions across modalities.

MPI resolution often suffers from\ndownsampling and coil sensitivity variations. VRF-Net addresses these\nchallenges by combining transformer-based global attention with residual\nconvolutional refinement, enabling recovery of both large-scale structures and\nfine details. To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is\ndegraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy. Training employed\npaired-image super-resolution on the public Open MPI dataset and a simulated\ndataset incorporating variable coil sensitivity profiles. For system matrix\nrecovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08\ndB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at\nchallenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717). For the simulated\ndataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 4.44, pSNR = 28.52 dB, and SSIM = 0.771 at 2x\nscaling, with stable performance at higher scales. On average, it reduced nRMSE\nby 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over\ninterpolation and CNN-based methods.

This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for\nSLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning\n(DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL\napproaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense\nframe-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point\ntrajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.\n  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly\naccessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to\ngenerate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with\nground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our\nevaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a\nmean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.\n  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation\nwith our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean\ndifference (95\\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%).\nIncorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of\nthe models in quantifying abnormal deformation.

Plant phenotyping plays\na vital role in selecting superior cultivars by characterizing plant traits\nsuch as morphology, canopy structure, and growth dynamics. However, traditional\nplant phenotyping methods are time-consuming, labor-intensive, and often\ndestructive. Recently, neural rendering techniques, notably Neural Radiance\nFields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have emerged as powerful\nframeworks for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. By capturing a sequence of\nmulti-view images or videos around a target plant, these methods enable\nnon-destructive reconstruction of complex plant architectures.

        "summary": "Understanding and mitigating flicker effects caused by rapid variations in\nlight intensity is critical for enhancing the performance of event cameras in\ndiverse environments. This paper introduces an innovative autonomous mechanism\nfor tuning the biases of event cameras, effectively addressing flicker across a\nwide frequency range -25 Hz to 500 Hz. Unlike traditional methods that rely on\nadditional hardware or software for flicker filtering, our approach leverages\nthe event cameras inherent bias settings. Utilizing a simple Convolutional\nNeural Networks -CNNs, the system identifies instances of flicker in a spatial\nspace and dynamically adjusts specific biases to minimize its impact. The\nefficacy of this autobiasing system was robustly tested using a face detector\nframework under both well-lit and low-light conditions, as well as across\nvarious frequencies. The results demonstrated significant improvements:\nenhanced YOLO confidence metrics for face detection, and an increased\npercentage of frames capturing detected faces. Moreover, the average gradient,\nwhich serves as an indicator of flicker presence through edge detection,\ndecreased by 38.2 percent in well-lit conditions and by 53.6 percent in\nlow-light conditions. These findings underscore the potential of our approach\nto significantly improve the functionality of event cameras in a range of\nadverse lighting scenarios.",

        "title": "Fast Measuring Pavement Crack Width by Cascading Principal Component Analysis",
        "summary": "Accurate quantification of pavement crack width plays a pivotal role in\nassessing structural integrity and guiding maintenance interventions. However,\nachieving precise crack width measurements presents significant challenges due\nto: (1) the complex, non-uniform morphology of crack boundaries, which limits\nthe efficacy of conventional approaches, and (2) the demand for rapid\nmeasurement capabilities from arbitrary pixel locations to facilitate\ncomprehensive pavement condition evaluation. To overcome these limitations,\nthis study introduces a cascaded framework integrating Principal Component\nAnalysis (PCA) and Robust PCA (RPCA) for efficient crack width extraction from\ndigital images. The proposed methodology comprises three sequential stages: (1)\ninitial crack segmentation using established detection algorithms to generate a\nbinary representation, (2) determination of the primary orientation axis for\nquasi-parallel cracks through PCA, and (3) extraction of the Main Propagation\nAxis (MPA) for irregular crack geometries using RPCA. Comprehensive evaluations\nwere conducted across three publicly available datasets, demonstrating that the\nproposed approach achieves superior performance in both computational\nefficiency and measurement accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art\ntechniques.",

        "summary": "Planktonic foraminifera, marine protists characterized by their intricate\nchambered shells, serve as valuable indicators of past and present\nenvironmental conditions. Understanding their chamber growth trajectory\nprovides crucial insights into organismal development and ecological adaptation\nunder changing environments. However, automated tracing of chamber growth from\nimaging data remains largely unexplored, with existing approaches relying\nheavily on manual segmentation of each chamber, which is time-consuming and\nsubjective. In this study, we propose an end-to-end pipeline that integrates\ninstance segmentation, a computer vision technique not extensively explored in\nforaminifera, with a dedicated chamber ordering algorithm to automatically\nreconstruct three-dimensional growth trajectories from high-resolution computed\ntomography scans. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate multiple\ninstance segmentation methods, each optimized for distinct spatial features of\nthe chambers, and examine their downstream influence on growth-order\nreconstruction accuracy. Experimental results on expert-annotated datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed pipeline substantially reduces manual effort\nwhile maintaining biologically meaningful accuracy. Although segmentation\nmodels exhibit under-segmentation in smaller chambers due to reduced voxel\nfidelity and subtle inter-chamber connectivity, the chamber-ordering algorithm\nremains robust, achieving consistent reconstruction of developmental\ntrajectories even under partial segmentation. This work provides the first\nfully automated and reproducible pipeline for digital foraminiferal growth\nanalysis, establishing a foundation for large-scale, data-driven ecological\nstudies.",

Methods: On HoloLens 2, we align Articulated HAnd\nTracking (AHAT) depth to Computed Tomography (CT)-derived skin meshes via (i)\ndepth-bias correction, (ii) brief human-in-the-loop initialization, (iii)\nglobal and local registration. We validated the surface-tracing error metric by\ncomparing \"skin-to-bone\" relative distances to CT ground truth on leg and foot\nmodels, using an AR-tracked tool. We then performed seven intraoperative target\ntrials (feet x2, ear x3, leg x2) during the initial stage of fibula free-flap\nharvest and mandibular reconstruction surgery, and collected 500+ data per\ntrial. Results: Preclinical validation showed tight agreement between AR-traced\nand CT distances (leg: median |Delta d| 0.78 mm, RMSE 0.97 mm; feet: 0.80 mm,\n1.20 mm). Clinically, per-point error had a median of 3.9 mm. Median errors by\nanatomy were 3.2 mm (feet), 4.3 mm (ear), and 5.3 mm (lower leg), with 5 mm\ncoverage 92-95%, 84-90%, and 72-86%, respectively. Feet vs. lower leg differed\nsignificantly (Delta median ~1.1 mm; p < 0.001). Conclusion: A depth-only,\nmarkerless AR pipeline on HMDs achieved ~3-4 mm median error across feet, ear,\nand lower leg in live surgical settings without fiducials, approaching typical\nclinical error thresholds for moderate-risk tasks. Human-guided initialization\nplus global-to-local registration enabled accurate alignment on small or\nlow-curvature targets, improving the clinical readiness of markerless AR\nguidance.",
